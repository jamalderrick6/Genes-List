INITIAL,GENE NAME,NORMAL FUNCTION,HEALTH CONDITIONS RELATED TO GENETIC CHANGE
AAAS ,aladin WD repeat nucleoporin,"The AAAS gene provides instructions for making a protein called ALADIN whose function is not well understood. Within cells, ALADIN is found in the nuclear envelope, the structure that surrounds the nucleus and separates it from the rest of the cell. Based on its location, ALADIN is thought to be involved in the movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus.","Triple A syndrome At least 49 mutations in the AAAS gene have been found to cause triple A syndrome. These mutations change the structure of ALADIN in different ways; however, almost all mutations prevent this protein from reaching its proper location in the nuclear envelope. The absence of ALADIN likely disrupts the movement of molecules across this membrane. Researchers suspect that DNA repair proteins may be unable to enter the nucleus if ALADIN is missing from the nuclear envelope. DNA damage that is not repaired can cause the cell to become unstable and lead to cell death. Although the nervous system is particularly vulnerable to DNA damage, it remains unknown exactly how mutations in the AAAS gene lead to the signs and symptoms of triple A syndrome. "
AASS ,aminoadipate-semialdehyde synthase,"The AASS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase. This enzyme is found in most tissues, with the highest amounts found in the liver. Aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase is involved in the breakdown of the amino acid lysine, a building block of most proteins. It is called a bifunctional enzyme because is performs two functions. One function, called lysine-ketoglutarate reductase, breaks down lysine to a molecule called saccharopine. The other function, called saccharopine dehydrogenase, breaks down saccharopine to a molecule called alpha-aminoadipate semialdehyde.","Hyperlysinemia At least five mutations in the AASS gene have been found to cause hyperlysinemia. Most of these mutations change single amino acids in aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase. These mutations are thought to decrease or eliminate enzyme activity, resulting in an inability to break down lysine. Lysine that is not broken down accumulates in the blood, but it typically causes no health problems.When mutations in the AASS gene impair the breakdown of saccharopine, this molecule builds up in blood and urine. This buildup is sometimes referred to as saccharopinuria, which is considered to be a variant of hyperlysinemia. It is unclear if saccharopinuria causes any symptoms. "
ABAT ,4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase,"The ABAT gene provides instructions for making the GABA-transaminase enzyme. This enzyme helps break down a brain chemical (neurotransmitter) called GABA when it is not needed. GABA normally helps slow down (inhibit) brain cell activity when necessary, to prevent the brain from being overloaded with too many signals. For this reason GABA is called an inhibitory neurotransmitter.","GABA-transaminase deficiency At least 10 mutations in the ABAT gene have been identified in people with GABA-transaminase deficiency, which is a brain disease (encephalopathy) that begins in infancy. Babies with this disorder have recurrent seizures (epilepsy), movement problems, and profoundly delayed development. They may grow more rapidly in length than usual (accelerated linear growth), even though they have feeding problems and may not gain weight as quickly as expected (failure to thrive). Individuals with this disorder usually do not survive past the first 2 years of life, but some live longer into childhood.The ABAT gene mutations that cause GABA-transaminase deficiency lead to a shortage (deficiency) of functional GABA-transaminase enzyme. As a result, GABA is not properly broken down, so this neurotransmitter and another molecule called beta-alanine accumulate abnormally in brain cells. This accumulation alters the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain, leading to the neurological problems characteristic of GABA-transaminase deficiency. Excess GABA also leads to abnormal release of a protein that is necessary for growth of the body's bones and tissues (growth hormone), resulting in the accelerated linear growth that sometimes occurs in this disorder. "
ABCA1 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 1,"The ABCA1 gene belongs to a group of genes called the ATP-binding cassette family, which provides instructions for making proteins that transport molecules across cell membranes. The ABCA1 protein is produced in many tissues, with high amounts found in the liver and in immune system cells called macrophages. This protein moves cholesterol and certain fats called phospholipids across the cell membrane to the outside of the cell. These substances are then picked up by a protein called apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), which is produced from the APOA1 gene. ApoA-I, cholesterol, and phospholipids combine to make high-density lipoprotein (HDL), often referred to as ""good cholesterol"" because high levels of this substance reduce the chances of developing heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. HDL is a molecule that carries cholesterol and phospholipids through the bloodstream from the body's tissues to the liver. Once in the liver, cholesterol and phospholipids are redistributed to other tissues or removed from the body. The process of removing excess cholesterol from cells is extremely important for balancing cholesterol levels and maintaining cardiovascular health.","Familial HDL deficiency Mutations in the ABCA1 gene can cause a condition called familial HDL deficiency. People with this condition have reduced levels of HDL in their blood and may experience early-onset cardiovascular disease, often before age 50. While one copy of the altered ABCA1 gene causes familial HDL deficiency, two copies of the altered gene cause a more severe related disorder called Tangier disease (described below).Most ABCA1 gene mutations that cause familial HDL deficiency change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ABCA1 protein. These mutations prevent the release of cholesterol and phospholipids from cells, decreasing the amount of these substances available to form HDL. As a result, the levels of HDL in the blood are low. A shortage (deficiency) of HDL is believed to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. "
ABCA3 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 3,"The ABCA3 gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in surfactant production. Surfactant is a mixture of certain fats (called phospholipids) and proteins that lines the lung tissue and makes breathing easy. Without normal surfactant, the tissue surrounding the air sacs in the lungs (the alveoli) sticks together after exhalation (because of a force called surface tension), causing the alveoli to collapse. As a result, filling the lungs with air on each breath becomes very difficult, and delivery of oxygen to the body is impaired.The ABCA3 protein is found in the membrane that surrounds lamellar bodies, which are the cellular structures in which the phospholipids and proteins that make up surfactant are packaged. The ABCA3 protein transports phospholipids into the lamellar bodies where they interact with surfactant proteins to form surfactant. The ABCA3 protein also appears to be involved in the formation of normal lamellar bodies. In addition to packaging, lamellar bodies are important for the correct processing of surfactant proteins, which is necessary for the proteins to mature and become functional.","Surfactant dysfunction More than 100 ABCA3 gene mutations that cause surfactant dysfunction have been identified. Surfactant dysfunction due to mutations in this gene (often called ABCA3 deficiency) can cause severe, often fatal breathing problems in newborns or gradual onset of milder breathing problems in children or adults.Some mutations in the ABCA3 gene lead to the production of a protein that is not inserted into the lamellar body membrane. Other mutations lead to the production of an abnormal protein that is found in the lamellar body membrane but has little or no function. Without ABCA3 protein function, the transport of surfactant phospholipids is decreased. In addition, lamellar body formation is impaired, which causes abnormal processing of surfactant proteins. ABCA3 gene mutations result in abnormal surfactant composition and function. The loss of functional surfactant raises surface tension in the alveoli, causing difficulty breathing and collapse of the lungs. It has been suggested that mutations that eliminate ABCA3 protein function cause severe forms of surfactant dysfunction, and mutations that leave some residual ABCA3 activity cause milder forms of the condition. "
ABCA4 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 4,"The ABCA4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in the retina, the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. Specifically, the ABCA4 protein is produced in the retina's light receptor cells (photoreceptors). The ABCA4 protein is active following phototransduction, the process by which light entering the eye is converted into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain. Phototransduction leads to the formation of potentially toxic substances that can damage photoreceptor cells. The ABCA4 protein removes one of these substances, called N-retinylidene-PE, from photoreceptor cells.","Cone-rod dystrophy More than 40 mutations in the ABCA4 gene have been found to cause a vision disorder called cone-rod dystrophy. The problems associated with this condition include a loss of visual sharpness (acuity), an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), and impaired color vision. These vision problems worsen over time. It is estimated that ABCA4 gene mutations account for 30 to 60 percent of cases of cone-rod dystrophy that are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.Most of the ABCA4 gene mutations that cause cone-rod dystrophy change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ABCA4 protein. The altered protein cannot remove N-retinylidene-PE from photoreceptor cells. As a result, N-retinylidene-PE combines with another substance to produce a molecule called N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine (A2E), which builds up in these cells. The buildup of A2E is toxic to photoreceptor cells and leads to their deterioration, causing progressive vision loss in people with cone-rod dystrophy. Cone-rod dystrophy caused by ABCA4 gene mutations tends to be associated with more severe vision problems than cone-rod dystrophy caused by other genetic mutations. "
ABCA12 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 12,"The ABCA12 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. ABC transporter proteins carry many types of molecules across cell membranes. In particular, the ABCA12 protein plays a major role in transporting fats (lipids) in cells that make up the outermost layer of skin (the epidermis). This lipid transport is needed to maintain the layers of lipids within the epidermis that are necessary to prevent water loss (dehydration) and for normal development of the skin. The ABCA12 protein is also found in several other tissues, including the testes, placenta, lungs, stomach, fetal brain, and liver.","Harlequin ichthyosis More than 65 mutations in the ABCA12 gene have been identified in people with harlequin ichthyosis. This skin condition is characterized by hard, thick scales that are present at birth; excessive dehydration; and increased risk of infections. Most of the mutations lead to an absence of ABCA12 protein or the production of an extremely small version of the protein that cannot transport lipids properly. A lack of lipid transport causes numerous problems with the development of the epidermis before and after birth. Specifically, it prevents the skin from forming an effective barrier against dehydration, and leads to the skin problems characteristic of harlequin ichthyosis. "
ABCB4 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 4,"The ABCB4 gene (also known as MDR3) provides instructions for making a protein that helps move certain fats called phospholipids across the membranes of liver cells and release the phospholipids into a digestive fluid called bile. Outside the liver cells, phospholipids attach (bind) to bile acids, which are a component of bile that digest fats. Large amounts of bile acids are potentially harmful to cells; when they are bound to phospholipids, bile acids are less toxic.","Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis More than 45 mutations in the ABCB4 gene have been found to cause a severe form of liver disease called progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3) that usually leads to liver failure. Affected individuals have a mutation in both copies of the ABCB4 gene. Mutations that lead to the production of a short, nonfunctional protein or cause no protein to be produced tend to be associated with more severe liver disease that appears earlier in life. ABCB4 gene mutations that cause PFIC3 impair the movement of phospholipids across cell membranes, leading to a lack of phospholipids available to bind to bile acids. A buildup of free bile acids damages liver cells, which causes the signs and symptoms of liver disease. "
ABCB7 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 7,"The ABCB7 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. ABC transporter proteins carry many types of molecules across membranes in cells.The ABCB7 protein is located in the inner membrane of cell structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria are involved in a wide variety of cellular activities, including energy production, chemical signaling, and regulation of cell growth and division. In the mitochondria of developing red blood cells (erythroblasts), the ABCB7 protein plays a critical role in the production of heme. Heme contains iron and is a component of hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in the blood.The ABCB7 protein is also involved in the formation of certain proteins containing clusters of iron and sulfur atoms (Fe-S clusters). Researchers suspect that the ABCB7 protein transports Fe-S clusters from mitochondria, where they are formed, to the surrounding cellular fluid (cytosol), where they can be incorporated into proteins. Overall, researchers believe that the ABCB7 protein helps maintain an appropriate balance of iron (iron homeostasis) in developing red blood cells.","X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia At least three mutations in the ABCB7 gene have been identified in people with X-linked sideroblastic anemia with ataxia. Each of these mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the ABCB7 protein, slightly altering its structure. These changes disrupt the protein's usual role in heme production and iron homeostasis. Anemia results when heme cannot be produced normally, and therefore not enough hemoglobin is made. It is unclear how changes in the ABCB7 gene lead to problems with coordination and balance (ataxia) and other movement abnormalities. "
ABCB11 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 11,"The ABCB11 gene provides instructions for making a protein called the bile salt export pump (BSEP), which is found in the liver. Bile salts are a component of bile, which is used to digest fats. Bile salts are produced by liver cells and then transported out of the cell by BSEP to make bile. The release of bile salts from liver cells is critical for the normal secretion of bile.","Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis Mutations in the ABCB11 gene can cause benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 (BRIC2). People with BRIC2 have occasional episodes of impaired bile secretion that lead to severe itching (pruritus) and yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). On occasion, people with BRIC2 have later been diagnosed with a more severe condition called progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 (described below) when their symptoms worsened.Affected individuals have a mutation in both copies of the ABCB11 gene. Mutations in the ABCB11 gene that cause BRIC2 lead to a 40 to 50 percent reduction of bile salt transport. The resulting buildup of bile salts in the liver leads to the signs and symptoms of BRIC2. It is unclear what causes the episodes to begin or end. "
ABCC2 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 2,"The ABCC2 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2). This protein is one of a family of multidrug resistance proteins involved in the transport of substances out of cells. For example, MRP2 clears certain drugs from organs and tissues, playing a part in drug metabolism. Drug metabolism involves the breakdown of drugs into different chemical components allowing the drugs to have their intended effects and eventually be eliminated from the body. MRP2 also transports a substance called bilirubin out of liver cells and into bile (a digestive fluid produced by the liver). Bilirubin is produced during the breakdown of old red blood cells and has an orange-yellow tint.MRP2 is primarily found within the outer membrane that surrounds cells in the liver, with smaller amounts in the kidneys, intestine, and placenta.","Dubin-Johnson syndrome More than 40 mutations in the ABCC2 gene have been found to cause Dubin-Johnson syndrome. This condition is characterized by jaundice, which is a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, that typically appears during adolescence or early adulthood. Most of the mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in MRP2. A common mutation in Iranian Jews living in Israel who have Dubin-Johnson syndrome replaces the amino acid isoleucine with the amino acid phenylalanine at position 1173 in MRP2 (written as Ile1173Phe or I1173F). Another mutation that is seen more frequently in those affected in Israel's Moroccan-Jewish population replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid histidine at position 1150 in MRP2 (written as Arg1150His or R1150H).ABCC2 gene mutations that cause Dubin-Johnson syndrome have a variety of effects on the structure and function of MRP2. Mutations may alter how the protein is made, impair transport of the protein to the cell surface, or cause the protein to be broken down too quickly. All of these mutations result in a decrease or absence of MRP2 activity at the cell membrane. As a result, the body's ability to release (excrete) bilirubin is impaired. A buildup of bilirubin causes jaundice in people with Dubin-Johnson syndrome. The accumulation of other substances that usually get transported out of tissues by the MRP2 protein can cause additional signs and symptoms in people with Dubin-Johnson syndrome, but these features usually do not cause health problems. "
ABCC6 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 6,"The ABCC6 gene provides instructions for making a protein called multidrug resistance-associated protein 6 (MRP6, also known as the ABCC6 protein). This protein is found primarily in the liver and kidneys, with small amounts in other tissues such as the skin, stomach, blood vessels, and eyes. The MRP6 protein belongs to a group of proteins that transport molecules across cell membranes; however, little is known about the substances transported by MRP6.Some studies suggest that MRP6 stimulates the release of a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from cells through an unknown mechanism. This ATP is quickly broken down into other molecules called adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate. Pyrophosphate helps control deposition of calcium (calcification) and other minerals (mineralization) in the body.Other studies suggest that MRP6 transports a substance that is involved in the breakdown of ATP. This unidentified substance is thought to help prevent mineralization of tissues.","Generalized arterial calcification of infancy At least 13 mutations in the ABCC6 gene have been identified in individuals with generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI), a life-threatening disorder characterized by abnormal calcification in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the arteries). Most of these mutations have also been identified in people with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), described below. These mutations lead to an absent or nonfunctional MRP6 protein. It is unclear how a lack of properly functioning MRP6 protein leads to GACI. This shortage may impair the release of ATP from cells. As a result, little pyrophosphate is produced and calcium accumulates in the blood vessels and other tissues affected by GACI. Alternatively, a lack of functioning MRP6 may impair the transport of a substance that would normally prevent mineralization, leading to the abnormal accumulation of calcium characteristic of GACI. It is not known why the same mutations can cause GACI in some individuals and PXE in others. "
ABCC8 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 8,"The ABCC8 gene provides instructions for making the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) protein. The SUR1 protein is one part (subunit) of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channel that is found across cell membranes in the beta cells of the pancreas. Beta cells secrete insulin, which is a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels. Insulin controls how much sugar (in the form of glucose) is passed from the bloodstream into cells to be used as energy. The K-ATP channel controls the secretion of insulin out of beta cells and into the bloodstream. These channels open and close in response to the amount of glucose in the bloodstream, which helps regulate insulin secretion and control blood sugar levels. The closing of the channels results in a process that triggers insulin secretion by beta cells.","Congenital hyperinsulinism More than 300 mutations in the ABCC8 gene have been found to cause congenital hyperinsulinism. This condition causes frequent episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), decreased energy, and irritability. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SUR1 protein.Some ABCC8 mutations prevent the SUR1 protein from reaching the cell membrane, interfering with the proper formation of the K-ATP channel. Other mutations interfere with the K-ATP channel's function or its responses to outside molecules. Defective K-ATP channels lead to the constant release of insulin from beta cells. As a result, glucose is rapidly removed from the bloodstream. Without treatment, the hypoglycemia caused by congenital hyperinsulinism may result in serious complications such as intellectual disability and seizures. "
ABCC9 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 9,"The ABCC9 gene provides instructions for making the sulfonylurea receptor 2 (SUR2) protein. This protein forms one part (subunit) of a channel that transports charged atoms of potassium (potassium ions) across cell membranes. Each of these channels consists of eight subunits: four SUR2 proteins and four proteins produced from either the KCNJ8 or KCNJ11 gene. The SUR2 subunits regulate the activity of the channel, determining whether it is open or closed.Channels made with the SUR2 protein are known as ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channels. The channels open and close in response to the amount of ATP, the cell's main energy source, inside the cell. The resulting transport of potassium ions is part of a complex network of signals that relay chemical messages into and out of cells.Although K-ATP channels are present in cells and tissues throughout the body, the highest levels of SUR2-containing channels are found in skeletal and heart (cardiac) muscle. These channels indirectly help regulate the concentration of calcium ions in cells. This regulation is essential for normal heart function. The function of these channels in other tissues is unclear.","Cantú syndrome At least 14 mutations in the ABCC9 gene have been found to cause Cantú syndrome, a rare condition characterized by excess hair growth (hypertrichosis), a distinctive facial appearance, and heart defects. Each of the mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the SUR2 protein. These changes likely alter the structure of the protein and its ability to regulate the activity of K-ATP channels. Studies suggest that the abnormal channels are open when they should be closed. However, it is unknown how this problem with potassium channel function leads to excess hair growth, heart defects, and the other features of Cantú syndrome. "
ABCD1 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily D member 1,"The ABCD1 gene provides instructions for producing the adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP). ALDP is located in the membranes of cell structures called peroxisomes. Peroxisomes are small sacs within cells that process many types of molecules. ALDP brings a group of fats called very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) into peroxisomes, where they are broken down.","X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy More than 650 mutations in the ABCD1 gene have been found to cause X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. This condition is characterized by varying degrees of cognitive and movement problems as well as hormone imbalances. The mutations that cause X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy prevent the production of any ALDP in about 75 percent of people with this disorder. Other people with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy can produce ALDP, but the protein is not able to perform its normal function. With little or no functional ALDP, VLCFAs are not broken down, and they build up in the body. The accumulation of these fats may be toxic to the adrenal glands (small glands on top of each kidney) and to the fatty layer of insulation (myelin) that surrounds many nerves in the body. Research suggests that the accumulation of VLCFAs triggers an inflammatory response in the brain, which could lead to the breakdown of myelin. The destruction of these tissues leads to the signs and symptoms of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. "
ABCD4 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily D member 4,"The ABCD4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the conversion of vitamin B12 (also known as cobalamin) into one of two molecules, adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) or methylcobalamin (MeCbl). AdoCbl is required for the normal function of an enzyme known as methylmalonyl CoA mutase. This enzyme helps break down certain protein building blocks (amino acids), fats (lipids), and cholesterol. AdoCbl is called a cofactor because it helps methylmalonyl CoA mutase carry out its function. MeCbl is also a cofactor, but for an enzyme known as methionine synthase. This enzyme converts the amino acid homocysteine to another amino acid, methionine. The body uses methionine to make proteins and other important compounds.The ABCD4 protein is found in the membrane that surrounds cell structures called lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments within cells in which enzymes digest and recycle materials. In the lysosomal membrane, the ABCD4 protein interacts with another protein called LMBD1 (produced from the LMBRD1 gene). Together, these two proteins transport vitamin B12 out of lysosomes, making it available for further processing into AdoCbl and MeCbl.","Methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria At least five mutations in the ABCD4 gene have been found to cause methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria, cblJ type, one form of a disorder that causes developmental delay, eye defects, neurological problems, and blood abnormalities. ABCD4 gene mutations involved in this condition lead to production of an abnormal ABCD4 protein that is unable to function. A shortage of functional ABCD4 protein prevents the release of vitamin B12 from lysosomes, so the vitamin is unavailable for the production of AdoCbl and MeCbl. Because both of these cofactors are missing, the enzymes that require them (methylmalonyl CoA mutase and methionine synthase) do not function normally. As a result, certain amino acids, lipids, and cholesterol are not broken down and homocysteine cannot be converted to methionine. This dual defect results in a buildup of toxic compounds as well as homocysteine, and a decrease in the production of methionine within the body. This combination of imbalances leads to the signs and symptoms of methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria. "
ABCG2 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (Junior blood group),"The ABCG2 gene belongs to a group of genes called the ATP-binding cassette family; genes in this family provide instructions for making proteins that transport molecules across cell membranes. In the intestines, the ABCG2 protein helps release (secrete) a substance called urate into the urine. Urate is a byproduct of certain normal biochemical reactions in the body. In the bloodstream it acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from the damaging effects of unstable molecules called free radicals. Urate levels are regulated by the kidneys and, to a lesser extent, by the intestines.The ABCG2 protein also transports certain drugs out of cells. For example, this protein clears some chemotherapy drugs from organs and tissues. Transport of these drugs allows them to have their intended effects and be eliminated from the body.","Gout Genetic changes in the ABCG2 gene have been found to be associated with a condition called gout, which is a form of arthritis that causes painful join inflammation.ABCG2 gene changes associated with gout decrease the protein's ability to release urate. One variant replaces the protein building block (amino acid) glutamine with the amino acid lysine at position 141 in the protein (written as Gln141Lys or Q141K). This change reduces the protein's ability to secrete urate by half. Another variant creates a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the ABCG2 protein (written as Gln126Ter or Q126X), which results in no functional ABCG2 protein. Variants in the ABCG2 gene reduce the removal of urate in the blood, which causes the blood level of urate to rise. The excess urate can accumulate in the body's joints in the form of crystals, triggering an inflammatory response from the immune system and leading to gout.While changes in the ABCG2 gene can alter urate levels in the body, they are not enough to cause gout by themselves. A combination of dietary, genetic, and other environmental factors play a part in determining the risk of developing this complex disorder. "
ABCG5 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 5,"The ABCG5 gene provides instructions for making sterolin-1, which makes up half of a protein called sterolin. The other half of the sterolin protein, sterolin-2, is produced from a gene called ABCG8. Sterolin is involved in eliminating plant sterols, which are fatty components of plant-based foods that cannot be used by human cells.Sterolin is a transporter protein, which is a type of protein that moves substances across cell membranes. It is found mostly in cells of the intestines and liver and transports plant sterols. After plant sterols are absorbed from food into intestinal cells, the sterolin transporters in these cells pump them back into the intestinal tract. Sterolin transporters in liver cells pump the plant sterols into a fluid called bile that is released into the intestine. From the intestine, the plant sterols are eliminated with the feces. This process removes most of the dietary plant sterols, and allows only about 5 percent of these substances to get into the bloodstream. Sterolin also helps regulate levels of cholesterol, another fatty substance found in animal products, in a similar fashion; normally about 50 percent of cholesterol in the diet is absorbed by the body.","Sitosterolemia At least 24 ABCG5 gene mutations have been identified in people with sitosterolemia, which is a condition caused by accumulation of plant sterols. The mutations result in a defective sterolin transporter and impair the elimination of plant sterols and, to a lesser degree, cholesterol from the body. These fatty substances build up in the arteries, skin, and other tissues, resulting in clogged blood vessels that can impair blood flow (atherosclerosis), fatty skin growths (xanthomas), and the additional signs and symptoms of sitosterolemia. Excess plant sterols in red blood cells likely make their cell membranes stiff and prone to rupture, leading to a reduced number of red blood cells (anemia). Changes in the lipid composition of the membranes of red blood cells and platelets may account for the other blood abnormalities that sometimes occur in sitosterolemia. "
ABCG8 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 8,"The ABCG8 gene provides instructions for making sterolin-2, which makes up half of a protein called sterolin.

Changes in the lipid composition of the membranes of red blood cells and platelets may account for the other blood abnormalities that sometimes occur in sitosterolemia. "
ABHD5 ,abhydrolase domain containing 5,"The ABHD5 gene provides instructions for making a protein that turns on (activates) an enzyme called adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). The ATGL enzyme plays a role in breaking down fats called triglycerides, which are the main source of stored energy in cells. Triglycerides are the major component of cell structures called lipid droplets (also called adiposomes). The ABHD5 protein and the ATGL enzyme are found on the surface of lipid droplets. Once activated, the ATGL enzyme breaks down triglycerides in these structures to provide energy for the body.","Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome At least 20 mutations in the ABHD5 gene have been found to cause Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome. These mutations impair the ABHD5 protein's ability to activate the ATGL enzyme. Without an active ATGL enzyme, triglycerides within lipid droplets cannot be broken down. As a result, these fats accumulate in various organs and tissues throughout the body, causing the signs and symptoms of Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome. "
ABL1 ,"ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase","The ABL1 gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in many processes in cells throughout the body. The ABL1 protein functions as a kinase, which is an enzyme that changes the activity of other proteins by adding a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) at specific positions. The ABL1 kinase is normally turned off (inactive) and must be turned on (activated) to perform its functions.The ABL1 kinase can be turned on by a number of different triggers and can add a phosphate group to many different proteins (also called substrates). This diversity allows ABL1 to be involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, including cell growth and division (proliferation), maturation (differentiation), and movement (migration). It can either aid in cell survival or trigger controlled cell death (apoptosis), depending on cellular conditions. The ABL1 kinase interacts with several proteins involved in the network of fibers called the actin cytoskeleton, which makes up the structural framework inside cells. These interactions help control cell migration and the attachment of cells to one another (adhesion), among many other processes. ABL1 can also help regulate the activity of other genes.The ABL1 gene belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous.","Chronic myeloid leukemia A genetic rearrangement (translocation) involving the ABL1 gene causes a type of cancer of blood-forming cells called chronic myeloid leukemia. This slow-growing cancer leads to an overproduction of abnormal white blood cells. Common features of the condition include excessive tiredness (fatigue), fever, weight loss, and an enlarged spleen.The translocation involved in this condition, written as t(9;22), fuses part of the ABL1 gene from chromosome 9 with part of the BCR gene from chromosome 22, creating an abnormal fusion gene called BCR-ABL1. The abnormal chromosome 22, containing a piece of chromosome 9 and the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, is commonly called the Philadelphia chromosome. The translocation is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in the abnormal blood cells. This type of genetic change, called a somatic mutation, is not inherited.The protein produced from the abnormal fusion gene, called BCR-ABL1, functions as a kinase. However, unlike the ABL1 kinase, it does not require signals in the cell to turn it on. The constantly active BCR-ABL1 protein signals cells to continue dividing abnormally and prevents them from self-destructing, which leads to overproduction of the abnormal cells.The presence of the Philadelphia chromosome provides a target for molecular therapies. "
ACAD8 ,acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family member 8,"The ACAD8 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IBD). This enzyme is found in mitochondria, the energy-producing centers inside cells. The IBD enzyme is involved in breaking down proteins from food. Specifically, this enzyme is responsible for the third step in the breakdown of a protein building block (amino acid) called valine. The IBD enzyme converts a molecule called isobutyryl-CoA into a molecule called methylacrylyl-CoA. Other enzymes further break down methylacrylyl-CoA into molecules that cells can use for energy.","Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency At least 19 mutations in the ACAD8 gene have been found to cause isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IBD) deficiency. Some of these mutations reduce the activity of the IBD enzyme, while other mutations prevent the gene from producing any functional enzyme. As a result, valine is not broken down properly. An inability to process valine may lead to reduced energy production and the features of IBD deficiency. "
ACAD9 ,acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family member 9,"The ACAD9 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found in mitochondria, the energy-producing structures inside cells. The ACAD9 enzyme is critical in helping assemble a group of proteins known as complex I. Complex I is one of several complexes that carry out a multistep process called oxidative phosphorylation, through which cells derive much of their energy.The ACAD9 enzyme also plays a role in fatty acid oxidation, a multistep process that occurs within mitochondria to break down (metabolize) fats and convert them into energy. The ACAD9 enzyme helps metabolize two fats called palmitate and oleate, which belong to a certain group of fats called long-chain fatty acids. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods without food (fasting), fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.","ACAD9 deficiency At least 30 ACAD9 gene mutations have been found to cause ACAD9 deficiency. This condition varies in severity and can cause muscle weakness (myopathy), heart problems, intellectual disability, and other signs and symptoms. Most ACAD9 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ACAD9 enzyme. Some mutations disrupt only complex I assembly. Decreased complex I formation can impair oxidative phosphorylation and reduce the amount of energy available in the cell. Other mutations affect the ACAD9 enzyme's structure or stability and likely disrupt both complex I assembly and long-chain fatty acid oxidation. A reduction in both of these energy production processes tends to be associated with the most severe signs and symptoms of ACAD9 deficiency.Although the exact mechanism that causes the signs and symptoms of ACAD9 deficiency is unclear, it is likely that cells that are less able to produce energy die off, particularly cells in the brain, skeletal muscle, and other tissues and organs that require a lot of energy. The loss of cells in these tissues is thought to lead to myopathy and other features of ACAD9 deficiency. "
ACADM ,acyl-CoA dehydrogenase medium chain,"The ACADM gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD). This enzyme functions within mitochondria, the energy-producing centers in cells. MCAD is essential for fatty acid oxidation, which is the multistep process that breaks down (metabolizes) fats and converts them to energy.MCAD is required to metabolize a group of fats called medium-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids are found in foods and body fat and are produced when larger fatty acids are metabolized. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods without food (fasting), fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.","Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency More than 80 mutations in the ACADM gene have been found to cause medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency. Many of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the MCAD enzyme. The most common change replaces the amino acid lysine with the amino acid glutamic acid at position 304 in the enzyme (written as Lys304Glu or K304E). This mutation and other amino acid substitutions alter the enzyme's structure, severely reducing or eliminating its activity. Other types of mutations lead to an abnormally small and unstable enzyme that cannot function.With a shortage (deficiency) of functional MCAD enzyme, medium-chain fatty acids are not metabolized properly. As a result, these fats are not converted to energy, which can lead to some features of this disorder such as lack of energy (lethargy) and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Medium-chain fatty acids or partially metabolized fatty acids may build up in tissues and damage the liver and brain. This abnormal buildup causes the other signs and symptoms of MCAD deficiency. "
ACADS ,acyl-CoA dehydrogenase short chain,"The ACADS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD). This enzyme functions within mitochondria, the energy-producing centers within cells. SCAD is essential for fatty acid oxidation, which is the multistep process that breaks down (metabolizes) fats and converts them to energy.SCAD is required to metabolize a group of fats called short-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids are found in some foods and are also produced when larger fatty acids are metabolized. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods without food (fasting), fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.","Short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency More than 55 mutations in the ACADS gene have been found to cause short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency. Almost all of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SCAD enzyme. These mutations prevent the enzyme from properly metabolizing short-chain fatty acids. As a result, these fats are not converted into energy, which can lead to the characteristic signs and symptoms of this disorder, including lack of energy (lethargy), low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), poor muscle tone (hypotonia), and weakness.Researchers have also identified two common variations (polymorphisms) in the ACADS gene that each change one amino acid in the SCAD enzyme. Unlike other changes in the ACADS gene, these polymorphisms do not cause SCAD deficiency but may increase a person's risk of developing this disorder. One of these polymorphisms replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid tryptophan at protein position 147 (written as Arg147Trp or R147W). The other polymorphism switches the amino acid glycine with the amino acid serine at protein position 185 (written as Gly185Ser or G185S). Other genetic and environmental factors likely influence the risk of developing SCAD deficiency when a person carries either of these polymorphisms. "
ACADSB ,acyl-CoA dehydrogenase short/branched chain,"The ACADSB gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called short/branched chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SBCAD, also known as 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase), which plays an important role in processing proteins. Normally, the body breaks down proteins from food into smaller parts called amino acids. Amino acids can be further processed to provide energy for the body. In cells throughout the body, SBCAD is found within specialized structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria convert energy from food into a form that cells can use.The SBCAD enzyme helps break down a particular amino acid called isoleucine. Specifically, this enzyme helps with the third step of the process, performing a chemical reaction that converts a molecule called 2-methylbutyryl-CoA to another molecule, tiglyl-CoA. Additional chemical reactions convert tiglyl-CoA into molecules that are used for energy. Through similar chemical reactions, the SBCAD enzyme also aids in the breakdown of other amino acids.","Short/branched chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency Researchers have identified more than 10 ACADSB gene mutations in people with short/branched chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SBCAD) deficiency. While most people with this condition have no related health problems, some have reduced energy (lethargy), muscle weakness, seizures, developmental delays, or other health problems.Many of the ACADSB gene mutations replace one of the amino acids in the SBCAD enzyme with an incorrect amino acid. Other mutations lead to an abnormally small version of this enzyme that is missing several amino acids. As a result of these mutations, SBCAD has little or no activity. With a shortage (deficiency) of normal enzyme activity, the body is unable to break down isoleucine properly. Researchers speculate that some features of this disorder, such as lethargy and muscle weakness, occur because isoleucine is not converted to energy. In addition, impairment of SBCAD may allow the buildup of toxic compounds, which can lead to serious health problems. "
ACADVL ,acyl-CoA dehydrogenase very long chain,"The ACADVL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD). This enzyme functions within mitochondria, the energy-producing centers in cells. Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is essential for fatty acid oxidation, which is the multistep process that breaks down (metabolizes) fats and converts them to energy.Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is required to metabolize a group of fats called very long-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids are found in food and body fat. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods without food (fasting), fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.","Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency More than 100 mutations in the ACADVL gene have been found to cause very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency. Many of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the VLCAD enzyme. Other mutations delete part of the ACADVL gene or create a premature stop signal in the instructions for making VLCAD. These mutations lead to a change in the enzyme's structure, severely reducing or eliminating its activity. As a result, very little functional enzyme is produced.With a shortage (deficiency) of functional VLCAD enzyme, very-long chain fatty acids are not metabolized properly. As a result, these fats are not converted to energy, which can lead to signs and symptoms of this disorder such as the lack of energy (lethargy) and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Very long-chain fatty acids or partially metabolized fatty acids may build up in tissues and damage the heart, liver, and muscles. This abnormal buildup causes the other signs and symptoms of VLCAD deficiency. "
ACAN ,aggrecan,"The ACAN gene provides instructions for making the aggrecan protein. Aggrecan is a type of protein known as a proteoglycan, which means it has several sugar molecules attached to it. It is the most abundant proteoglycan in cartilage, a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone (a process called ossification), except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose, airways, and external ears.Aggrecan attaches to the other components of cartilage, organizing the network of molecules that gives cartilage its strength. These interactions occur at a specific region of the aggrecan protein called the C-type lectin domain (CLD). Because of the attached sugars, aggrecan attracts water molecules and gives cartilage its gel-like structure. This feature enables the cartilage to resist compression, protecting bones and joints. Although its role is unclear, aggrecan affects bone development.","Familial osteochondritis dissecans At least one mutation in the ACAN gene has been found to cause familial osteochondritis dissecans. This condition is characterized by areas of bone damage (lesions) caused by the detachment of cartilage and some of the underlying bone from the end of the bone at a joint. People with familial osteochondritis dissecans have multiple lesions that affect the knees, elbows, hips, or ankles. Other common features are short stature and early development of a painful joint disorder called osteoarthritis.The ACAN gene mutation associated with this condition changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the CLD of the aggrecan protein. Specifically, the amino acid valine is replaced by the amino acid methionine at protein position 2303 (written as Val2303Met or V2303M). The abnormal aggrecan protein is unable to attach to other components of cartilage. As a result, the cartilage is disorganized and weak. It is unclear how the abnormal cartilage is involved in the development of the lesions and osteoarthritis characteristic of familial osteochondritis dissecans. Researchers have suggested that a disorganized cartilage network in growing bones impairs their growth, leading to short stature. "
ACAT1 ,acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1,"The ACAT1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found in the energy-producing centers within cells (mitochondria). This enzyme plays an essential role in breaking down proteins and fats from the diet. Specifically, it helps process isoleucine, an amino acid that is a building block of many proteins. This enzyme is also involved in processing ketones, which are molecules that are produced when fats are broken down in the body.During the breakdown of proteins, the ACAT1 enzyme is responsible for the last step in processing isoleucine. It converts a molecule called 2-methyl-acetoacetyl-CoA into two smaller molecules, propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, that can be used to produce energy.The ACAT1 enzyme carries out the last step in ketone breakdown (ketolysis) during the processing of fats. The enzyme converts a molecule called acetoacetyl-CoA into two molecules of acetyl-CoA, which can be used to produce energy. In the liver, the enzyme also carries out this chemical reaction in reverse, which is the first step in building new ketones (ketogenesis).","Beta-ketothiolase deficiency More than 40 mutations in the ACAT1 gene have been identified in people with beta-ketothiolase deficiency. Some of these genetic changes disrupt the normal function of the enzyme, while other mutations prevent cells from producing any functional enzyme.A shortage of the ACAT1 enzyme prevents the body from processing proteins and fats properly. As a result, chemical byproducts called organic acids can build up to toxic levels in the blood. These substances cause the blood to become too acidic (ketoacidosis), which can damage the body's tissues and organs, particularly in the nervous system. This damage leads to episodes of vomiting, dehydration, and other health problems associated with beta-ketothiolase deficiency. "
ACE ,angiotensin I converting enzyme,"The ACE gene provides instructions for making the angiotensin-converting enzyme. This enzyme is able to cut (cleave) proteins. It is part of the renin-angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure and the balance of fluids and salts in the body. By cutting a protein called angiotensin I at a particular location, the angiotensin-converting enzyme converts this protein to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to narrow (constrict), which results in increased blood pressure. This protein also stimulates production of the hormone aldosterone, which triggers the absorption of salt and water by the kidneys. The increased amount of fluid in the body also increases blood pressure. Proper blood pressure during fetal growth, which delivers oxygen to the developing tissues, is required for normal development of the kidneys, particularly of structures called the proximal tubules, and other tissues. In addition, angiotensin II may play a more direct role in kidney development, perhaps by affecting growth factors involved in the development of kidney structures.The angiotensin-converting enzyme can cleave other proteins, including bradykinin. Bradykinin causes blood vessels to widen (dilate), which decreases blood pressure. Cleavage by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inactivates bradykinin, helping to increase blood pressure.","Renal tubular dysgenesis Mutations in the ACE gene are the most common cause of a severe kidney disorder called renal tubular dysgenesis; at least 33 ACE gene mutations have been found in people with this disorder. Renal tubular dysgenesis is characterized by abnormal kidney development before birth, the inability to produce urine (anuria), and severe low blood pressure (hypotension). These problems result in a reduction of amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios), which leads to a set of birth defects known as the Potter sequence.Renal tubular dysgenesis can be caused by mutations in both copies of any of the genes involved in the renin-angiotensin system. The ACE gene mutations that cause this disorder prevent the production of functional angiotensin-converting enzyme, which impairs the formation of angiotensin II and results in a nonfunctional renin-angiotensin system. Without this system, the kidneys cannot control blood pressure. Because of low blood pressure, the flow of blood is reduced (hypoperfusion), and the body does not get enough oxygen during fetal development. As a result, kidney development is impaired, leading to the features of renal tubular dysgenesis. "
ACOX1 ,acyl-CoA oxidase 1,"The ACOX1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called peroxisomal straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase. This enzyme is found in sac-like cell structures (organelles) called peroxisomes, which contain a variety of enzymes that break down many different substances. The peroxisomal straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase enzyme plays a role in the breakdown of certain fat molecules called very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). Specifically, it is involved in the first step of a process called the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. This process shortens the VLCFA molecules by two carbon atoms at a time until the VLCFAs are converted to a molecule called acetyl-CoA, which is transported out of the peroxisomes for reuse by the cell.","Peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency More than 20 ACOX1 gene mutations have been identified in people with peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency. These mutations prevent the peroxisomal straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase enzyme from breaking down VLCFAs efficiently. As a result, these fatty acids accumulate in the body. It is unclear exactly how VLCFA accumulation leads to the specific features of peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency. However, researchers suggest that the abnormal fatty acid accumulation triggers inflammation in the nervous system that leads to the breakdown of myelin, which is the covering that protects nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. Destruction of myelin leads to a loss of myelin-containing tissue (white matter) in the brain and spinal cord; loss of white matter is described as leukodystrophy. Leukodystrophy is likely involved in the development of the neurological abnormalities that occur in peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency. "
ACP5 ,"acid phosphatase 5, tartrate resistant","The ACP5 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase type 5 (TRAP). The TRAP enzyme primarily regulates the activity of a protein called osteopontin, which is produced in bone cells called osteoclasts and in immune cells. Osteopontin performs a variety of functions in these cells. Two versions (isoforms) of the TRAP enzyme are produced: TRAP5a is found primarily in immune cells and TRAP5b is found primarily in bone cells called osteoclasts.Osteoclasts are specialized cells that break down and remove (resorb) bone tissue that is no longer needed. These cells are involved in bone remodeling, which is a normal process that replaces old bone tissue with new bone. During bone remodeling, osteopontin is turned on (activated), allowing osteoclasts to attach (bind) to bones. When the breakdown of bone is complete, TRAP5b turns off (inactivates) osteopontin, causing the osteoclasts to release themselves from bone.In the immune system, osteopontin is found primarily in cells called macrophages and dendritic cells. The protein helps fight infection by promoting inflammation, regulating immune cell activity, and turning on various immune system cells that are necessary to fight off foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. Like TRAP5b in bone cells, the TRAP5a enzyme inactivates osteopontin in macrophages and dendritic cells when it is no longer needed.","Spondyloenchondrodysplasia with immune dysregulation At least 10 mutations in the ACP5 gene have been found to cause spondyloenchondrodysplasia with immune dysregulation (SPENCDI). This condition is characterized by abnormalities in bone growth and immune system function. The ACP5 gene mutations that cause SPENCDI typically change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the TRAP enzyme or result in the production of an abnormally short enzyme. These mutations affect both TRAP isoforms and impair or eliminate TRAP's ability to inactivate osteopontin. As a result, osteopontin is abnormally active, prolonging bone breakdown by osteoclasts and triggering abnormal inflammation and immune responses by immune cells.In people with SPENCDI, increased bone breakdown contributes to the skeletal abnormalities, including irregularly shaped bones and short stature. An overactive immune system leads to increased susceptibility to autoimmune disorders, which occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. Immune system abnormalities also impair the body's normal response to harmful invaders, resulting in frequent infections. SPENCDI has several additional features, including movement disorders and intellectual disability, but it is unknown how changes in TRAP enzyme function lead to these other signs and symptoms. "
ACSF3 ,acyl-CoA synthetase family member 3,"The ACSF3 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme involved in the formation (synthesis) of fatty acids, which are building blocks used to make fats (lipids). The ACSF3 enzyme performs a chemical reaction that converts malonic acid to malonyl-CoA, which is the first step of fatty acid synthesis. Based on this activity, the enzyme is classified as a malonyl-CoA synthetase. The ACSF3 enzyme also converts methylmalonic acid to methylmalonyl-CoA, making it a methylmalonyl-CoA synthetase as well.Fatty acid synthesis occurs through two pathways, one of which takes place in cellular structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use, and fatty acid synthesis in these structures is thought to be important for their proper functioning. The ACSF3 enzyme is found only in mitochondria and is involved in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis.","Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria About a dozen mutations in the ACSF3 gene have been found in people with combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA), a condition characterized by elevated levels of chemicals known as malonic acid and methylmalonic acid in the body. This condition can cause development and growth problems beginning in childhood or neurological problems beginning in adulthood.Most ACSF3 gene mutations involved in CMAMMA change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ACSF3 enzyme. The altered enzyme likely has little or no function. Because the enzyme cannot convert malonic and methylmalonic acids, they build up in the body. Damage to organs and tissues caused by accumulation of malonic and methylmalonic acids may be responsible for the signs and symptoms of CMAMMA, although the mechanisms are unclear. "
ACTA1 ,"actin, alpha 1, skeletal muscle","The ACTA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called skeletal alpha (α)-actin, which is part of the actin protein family. Actin proteins are important for cell movement and the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction). These proteins also help maintain the cytoskeleton, which is the structural framework that determines cell shape and organizes cell contents.Skeletal α-actin plays an important role in skeletal muscles, which are muscles that the body uses for movement. Within skeletal muscle cells, skeletal α-actin is an essential component of structures called sarcomeres. Sarcomeres are composed of thin filaments made up of actin and thick filaments made up of another protein called myosin. Attachment (binding) and release of the overlapping thick and thin filaments allows them to move relative to each other so that the muscles can contract.","Actin-accumulation myopathy At least nine mutations in the ACTA1 gene have been identified in people with actin-accumulation myopathy. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the skeletal α-actin protein sequence.Researchers suggest that ACTA1 gene mutations that cause actin-accumulation myopathy may affect the way the actin binds to ATP. ATP is a molecule that supplies energy for cells' activities and is important in the formation of thin filaments from individual actin molecules. Dysfunctional actin-ATP binding may result in abnormal thin filament formation and impair muscle contraction, leading to muscle weakness and the other signs and symptoms of actin-accumulation myopathy. "
ACTA2 ,"actin, alpha 2, smooth muscle, aorta","The ACTA2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called smooth muscle alpha (α)-2 actin, which is part of the actin protein family. Actin proteins are important for cell movement and the tensing (contraction) of muscles.Smooth muscle α-2 actin is found in smooth muscle cells. Smooth muscles line the internal organs, including the blood vessels, stomach, and intestines. Within smooth muscle cells, smooth muscle α-2 actin forms the core of structures called sarcomeres, which are necessary for muscles to contract. Smooth muscles contract and relax as part of their normal function without being consciously controlled.Layers of smooth muscle cells are found in the walls of the arteries, which are blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Smooth muscle α-2 actin contributes to the ability of these muscles to contract, which allows the arteries to maintain their shape instead of stretching out as blood is pumped through them.","Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection More than 30 ACTA2 gene mutations have been identified in people with familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (familial TAAD). This disorder involves problems with the aorta, which is the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body. The aorta can weaken and stretch, causing a bulge in the blood vessel wall (an aneurysm). Stretching of the aorta may also lead to a sudden tearing of the layers in the aorta wall (aortic dissection). Aortic aneurysm and dissection can cause life-threatening internal bleeding.ACTA2 gene mutations that are associated with familial TAAD change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the smooth muscle α-2 actin protein. These changes likely affect the way the protein functions in smooth muscle contraction, interfering with the sarcomeres' ability to prevent arteries from stretching. The aorta, where the force of pumping blood coming directly from the heart is most intense, is particularly vulnerable to this stretching, resulting in the aortic aneurysms and dissections associated with familial TAAD. "
ACTB ,actin beta,"The ACTB gene provides instructions for making a protein called beta (β)-actin, which is part of the actin protein family. Proteins in this family are organized into a network of fibers called the actin cytoskeleton, which makes up the structural framework inside cells. There are six types of actin; four are present only in muscle cells, where they are involved in the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction). The other two actin proteins, β-actin and gamma (γ)-actin (produced from the ACTG1 gene), are found in cells throughout the body. These proteins play important roles in determining cell shape and controlling cell movement (motility). Studies suggest that β-actin may also be involved in relaying chemical signals within cells.","Baraitser-Winter syndrome Several mutations in the ACTB gene have been found to cause Baraitser-Winter syndrome, a rare condition that affects the development of the brain, eyes, and other facial features. The known mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in β-actin. The most common mutation replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid histidine at protein position 196 (written as Arg196His or R196H). The mutations that cause Baraitser-Winter syndrome alter the function of β-actin, which causes changes in the actin cytoskeleton that modify the structure and organization of cells and affect their ability to move. Because β-actin is present in cells throughout the body and is involved in many cell activities, problems with its function likely impact many aspects of development. These changes underlie the variety of signs and symptoms associated with Baraitser-Winter syndrome. "
ACTG1 ,actin gamma 1,"The ACTG1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called gamma (γ)-actin, which is part of the actin protein family. Proteins in this family are organized into a network of fibers called the actin cytoskeleton, which makes up the structural framework inside cells. There are six types of actin; four are present only in muscle cells, where they are involved in the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction). The other two actin proteins, γ-actin and beta (β)-actin (produced from the ACTB gene), are found in cells throughout the body. These proteins play important roles in determining cell shape and controlling cell movement (motility).γ-actin is particularly abundant in certain cells in the intestines and the inner ear. Within the inner ear, this protein is found in specialized cells called hair cells, which are essential for normal hearing.","Baraitser-Winter syndrome At least six mutations in the ACTG1 gene have been found to cause Baraitser-Winter syndrome, a rare condition that affects the development of the brain, eyes, and other facial features. The known mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in γ-actin. The most common mutation replaces the amino acid serine with the amino acid phenylalanine at protein position 155 (written as Ser155Phe or S155F). The mutations that cause Baraitser-Winter syndrome alter the function of γ-actin, which causes changes in the actin cytoskeleton that modify the structure and organization of cells and affect their ability to move. Because γ-actin is present in cells throughout the body and is involved in many cell activities, problems with its function likely impact many aspects of development. These changes underlie the variety of signs and symptoms associated with Baraitser-Winter syndrome. "
ACTG2 ,"actin, gamma 2, smooth muscle, enteric","The ACTG2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called gamma (γ)-2 actin, which is part of the actin protein family. Actin proteins are organized into filaments, which are important for the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction) and cell movement. These filaments also help maintain the cytoskeleton, which is the structural framework that determines cell shape and organizes cell contents.The γ-2 actin protein is found in smooth muscle cells of the urinary and intestinal tracts. Smooth muscles line the internal organs; they contract and relax without being consciously controlled. The γ-2 actin protein is necessary for contraction of the smooth muscles in the bladder and intestines. These contractions empty urine from the bladder and move food through the intestines as part of the digestive process.","Intestinal pseudo-obstruction Several inherited mutations in the ACTG2 gene have been identified in people with intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a condition that impairs the smooth muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract (peristalsis). This condition mimics a physical blockage of the intestines without an actual obstruction. Problems with emptying the bladder can also occur in people with this disorder.The ACTG2 gene mutations that cause intestinal pseudo-obstruction are thought to hinder the formation of actin filaments in the cytoskeleton and reduce the ability of smooth muscles in the intestines and bladder to contract. As a result, peristalsis in the intestines is impaired and the bladder is less able to contract and expel urine, leading to the signs and symptoms of this condition. "
ACVR1 ,activin A receptor type 1,"The ACVR1 gene provides instructions for making the activin receptor type-1 (ACVR1) protein, which is a member of a protein family called bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptors. BMP receptors span the cell membrane, so that one end of the protein remains inside the cell and the other end projects from the outer surface of the cell. This arrangement allows receptors to receive signals from outside the cell and transmit them inside to affect cell development and function.The ACVR1 protein is found in many tissues of the body including skeletal muscle and cartilage. It helps to control the growth and development of the bones and muscles, including the gradual replacement of cartilage by bone (ossification). This process occurs in normal skeletal maturation from birth to young adulthood.The ACVR1 protein is normally turned on (activated) at appropriate times by molecules called ligands. Activation may occur when these ligands, such as BMPs or a protein called activin A, attach (bind) to the receptor or to other proteins with which it forms a complex. Another protein called FKBP12 can turn off (inhibit) ACVR1 by binding to the receptor and preventing inappropriate (leaky) activation in the absence of ligands.","Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva Mutations in the ACVR1 gene cause fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, a disorder in which muscles and connective tissue such as tendons and ligaments are gradually replaced by bone (ossified). The formation of bone tissue outside the skeleton freezes joints and limits movement in affected individuals. The most common mutation, which occurs in all individuals with the classic features of the condition, substitues the protein building block (amino acid) histidine for the amino acid arginine at position 206 of the ACVR1 protein (written as Arg206His or R206H). Other mutations in the ACVR1 gene cause rarer forms of the condition that can be more severe and often involve skeletal abnormalities, such as multiple abnormally formed fingers and toes.Studies show that the R206H mutation changes the shape of the ACVR1 protein. This shape change disrupts the binding of the inhibitor protein FKBP12. As a result, the receptor is constantly turned on (constitutively activated), even in the absence of ligands. Other ACVR1 gene mutations result in a receptor protein that is turned on by ligands more easily than the normal version of the protein. Too much receptor activity causes overgrowth of bone and cartilage, resulting in the signs and symptoms of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. "
ACVRL1 ,activin A receptor like type 1,"The ACVRL1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called activin receptor-like kinase 1. This protein is found on the surface of cells, especially in the lining of developing arteries.The ACVRL1 protein is a receptor. It acts as a ""lock"" waiting for a specific protein, called its ligand, to serve as the ""key."" In the case of the ACVRL1 protein, the ligand is called transforming growth factor beta. The interaction between these proteins plays a role in the development of blood vessels. In particular, this protein interaction is involved in the specialization of new blood vessels into arteries or veins.","Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia Dozens of mutations in the ACVRL1 gene have been found to cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2. Many ACVRL1 gene mutations substitute one protein building block (amino acid) for another amino acid in the ACVRL1 protein, which impairs the protein's function. Other mutations prevent production of the ACVRL1 protein or result in an abnormally small protein that cannot function. The shortage of functional ACVRL1 protein appears to interfere with the development of boundaries between arteries and veins, resulting in the signs and symptoms of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2. "
ACY1 ,aminoacylase 1,"The ACY1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aminoacylase 1, which is found in many tissues and organs, including the kidneys and the brain. This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of proteinswhen they are no longer needed. Many proteins in the body have a chemical group called an acetyl group attached to one end. This modification, called N-acetylation, helps protect and stabilize the protein. Aminoacylase 1 performs the final step in the breakdown of these proteins by removing the acetyl group from certain protein building blocks (amino acids). The amino acids can then be recycled and used to build other proteins.","Aminoacylase 1 deficiency Several mutations in the ACY1 gene have been identified in people with a condition called aminoacylase 1 deficiency. This condition is characterized by delayed development of mental and motor skills and other neurological problems, although some people with the condition have no signs or symptoms. Most of the associated ACY1 gene mutations change single amino acids in the aminoacylase 1 enzyme. These and other ACY1 gene mutations lead to production of an aminoacylase 1 enzyme with little or no function. Without this enzyme's function, acetyl groups are not efficiently removed from a subset of amino acids (including methionine, glutamic acid, alanine, serine, glycine, leucine, valine, threonine, and isoleucine) during the breakdown of proteins. The excess N-acetylated amino acids are released from the body in urine. It is not known how a reduction of aminoacylase 1 function leads to neurological problems in people with aminoacylase 1 deficiency. "
ADA ,adenosine deaminase,"The ADA gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme adenosine deaminase. This enzyme is produced in all cells, but the highest levels of adenosine deaminase occur in immune system cells called lymphocytes, which develop in lymphoid tissues. These lymphoid tissues include the thymus, which is a gland located behind the breastbone, and lymph nodes, which are found throughout the body. Lymphocytes form the immune system, which defends the body against potentially harmful invaders, such as viruses or bacteria.The function of the adenosine deaminase enzyme is to eliminate a molecule called deoxyadenosine, which is generated when DNA is broken down. Adenosine deaminase converts deoxyadenosine, which is toxic to lymphocytes, to another molecule called deoxyinosine, which is not harmful.","Adenosine deaminase deficiency More than 70 mutations in the ADA gene have been identified. Most of these mutations result in the substitution of one protein building block (amino acid) for another amino acid in the adenosine deaminase enzyme. Other mutations cause the enzyme to be unstable or prevent it from being produced at all.These mutations result in the absence or deficiency of the adenosine deaminase enzyme in cells, preventing the normal breakdown of deoxyadenosine. A buildup of this toxic compound interferes with the development and maintenance of lymphocytes, resulting in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which is characteristic of adenosine deaminase deficiency. "
ADA2 ,adenosine deaminase 2,"The ADA2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called adenosine deaminase 2. This enzyme breaks down molecules called adenosine and 2'-deoxyadenosine. Because this enzyme functions in the spaces between cells, it is described as extracellular. Another form of the enzyme, adenosine deaminase 1, breaks down the same molecules inside cells. This other version of the enzyme is produced from the ADA gene.Researchers are still working to determine the functions of adenosine deaminase 2. Studies suggest that it acts as a growth factor, which means that it stimulates cell growth and division. In particular, the enzyme appears to be involved in the growth and development of certain immune system cells, including macrophages, which are a type of white blood cell that plays a critical role in inflammation. Inflammation is a normal immune system response to injury and foreign invaders (such as bacteria). Some macrophages are pro-inflammatory, meaning they promote inflammation, while others are anti-inflammatory, meaning they reduce inflammation.","Adenosine deaminase 2 deficiency More than 60 mutations in the ADA2 gene have been found to cause adenosine deaminase 2 deficiency, a disorder characterized by abnormal inflammation of various organs and tissues, particularly the blood vessels (vasculitis). These mutations severely reduce or eliminate the function of adenosine deaminase 2. Researchers do not fully understand how a shortage (deficiency) of this enzyme's activity leads to vasculitis and immune system abnormalities. They speculate that the enzyme deficiency may disrupt the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory macrophages in various tissues, leading to a buildup of pro-inflammatory macrophages and abnormal inflammation. "
ADAMTS2 ,ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 2,"The ADAMTS2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that processes several types of procollagen molecules. Procollagens are the precursors of collagens, which are complex molecules found in the spaces between cells that add strength, support, and stretchiness (elasticity) to many body tissues. The ADAMTS2 enzyme cuts a short chain of protein building blocks (amino acids) off one end of procollagens. This clipping step is necessary for the resulting collagen molecules to assemble into strong, slender fibrils.","Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Several mutations in the ADAMTS2 gene have been identified in people with a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome called the dermatosparaxis type. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect the connective tissues supporting the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues. The dermatosparaxis type is characterized by soft, fragile skin that sags and wrinkles; easy bruising; and distinctive facial features.Mutations in the ADAMTS2 gene greatly reduce the production or activity of the ADAMTS2 enzyme. Without enough of this enzyme, procollagens cannot be processed correctly. As a result, collagen fibrils are not assembled properly. The resulting fibrils are disorganized, which weakens connective tissues and leads to the signs and symptoms of the disorder. "
ADAMTS10 ,ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 10,"The ADAMTS10 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found in many of the body's cells and tissues. This enzyme is part of a family of metalloproteases, which are zinc-containing enzymes that cut apart other proteins. Although the function of the ADAMTS10 enzyme is unknown, it is critical for growth before and after birth. Researchers believe that it may be involved in the development of structures including the skin, eyes, heart, and skeleton.","Weill-Marchesani syndrome At least five mutations in the ADAMTS10 gene have been identified in people with Weill-Marchesani syndrome. Each of these mutations prevents the cell from producing any functional ADAMTS10 enzyme. Researchers speculate that a loss of this enzyme disrupts skeletal development, leading to short stature and unusually short fingers and toes (brachydactyly). A shortage of the ADAMTS10 enzyme also interferes with the development and function of the lens of the eye, causing eye abnormalities and impaired vision. Additionally, a lack of this enzyme may disrupt the normal development of the heart, resulting in the heart defects occasionally seen in people with Weill-Marchesani syndrome. "
ADAMTS13 ,ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 13,"The ADAMTS13 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is involved in blood clotting. After an injury, clots normally protect the body by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss.The ADAMTS13 enzyme processes a large protein called von Willebrand factor, which also plays a role in clot formation. The unprocessed form of von Willebrand factor interacts easily with cells called platelets, which circulate in the bloodstream and are essential for blood clotting. The factor helps platelets stick together and adhere to the walls of blood vessels, forming temporary clots. The ADAMTS13 enzyme cuts von Willebrand factor into smaller pieces. By processing von Willebrand factor in this way, the enzyme prevents it from triggering the formation of unnecessary blood clots.","Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura More than 70 mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene have been reported in people with the familial form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ADAMTS13 enzyme. Other mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small version of the enzyme that cannot function properly.Mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene severely reduce the activity of the ADAMTS13 enzyme. As a result, von Willebrand factor is not processed normally in the bloodstream. If the factor is not cut into smaller fragments by the ADAMTS13 enzyme, it promotes the formation of abnormal clots throughout the body. The large, uncut version of von Willebrand factor induces platelets to stick together and adhere to the walls of blood vessels, even in the absence of injury. Additional factors such as pregnancy, diarrhea, surgery, and infection likely play a role in triggering abnormal clotting. Blood clots can block blood flow through small vessels, causing damage to the brain, kidneys, heart, and other organs. Abnormal clotting also causes other complications associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. "
ADAMTSL2 ,ADAMTS like 2,"The ADAMTSL2 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. The ADAMTSL2 protein is active in many different tissues. It is found in the extracellular matrix, which is the intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells.Studies suggest that the ADAMTSL2 protein interacts with a protein called latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 1 (LTBP1). The LTBP1 protein is involved in the storage of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), a critical growth factor that helps control the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (motility), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). Through its interaction with the LTBP1 protein, researchers suspect that the ADAMTSL2 protein may help regulate the availability of TGF-β.The interaction between the ADAMTSL2 protein and the LTBP1 protein suggests that ADAMTSL2 may also play a role in the microfibrillar network. This organized clustering of thread-like filaments (called microfibrils) in the extracellular matrix provides strength and flexibility to tissues throughout the body.","Geleophysic dysplasia At least five mutations in the ADAMTSL2 gene have been identified in people with geleophysic dysplasia. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ADAMTSL2 protein, which probably alters the protein's 3-dimensional shape.Through a process that is poorly understood, ADAMTSL2 gene mutations alter the microfibrillar network in many different tissues. Impairment of this essential network disrupts the normal functions of cells, which likely contributes to the varied signs and symptoms of geleophysic dysplasia. Researchers are working to determine how mutations in the ADAMTSL2 gene lead to short stature, heart disease, and the other features of this condition. "
ADAMTSL4 ,ADAMTS like 4,"The ADAMTSL4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found throughout the body. The ADAMTSL4 protein is released from cells into the extracellular matrix, which is an intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. In this matrix, the ADAMTSL4 protein attaches (binds) to another protein called fibrillin-1. Fibrillin-1 proteins bind to each other and other proteins to form threadlike filaments called microfibrils. It is likely that the binding of ADAMTSL4 to fibrillin-1 promotes microfibril assembly. Microfibrils provide support to many tissues, including the lenses of the eyes, which are held in their central position by these filaments.","Isolated ectopia lentis At least 15 mutations in the ADAMTSL4 gene have been found to cause isolated ectopia lentis. In this condition, the lens in one or both eyes is off-center (displaced), which leads to vision problems. An ADAMTSL4 gene mutation that is frequently found in affected individuals of European ancestry deletes 20 DNA building blocks (nucleotides) from the gene (written as 767_787del20). This mutation leads to the production of a protein that is abnormally short and nonfunctional. A lack of functional ADAMTSL4 protein likely diminishes the ability of fibrillin-1 to effectively form microfibrils. As a result, there is a reduction in filaments to anchor the lens in its central position at the front of the eye, leading to its displacement and the vision problems characteristic of isolated ectopia lentis. While the ADAMTSL4 protein is found throughout the body, it is thought that other proteins can compensate for its function in tissues other than the eyes, which likely explains why only the eyes are affected in this condition. "
ADAR ,"adenosine deaminase, RNA specific","The ADAR gene provides instructions for making a protein called RNA-specific adenosine deaminase 1 (ADAR1). This protein is involved in making changes to (editing) ribonucleic acid (RNA), a chemical cousin of DNA. Specifically, it attaches (binds) to RNA and changes an RNA building block (nucleotide) called adenosine to another nucleotide called inosine.The ADAR1 protein is involved in the control of the innate immune response, which is the immune system's early response to foreign invaders (pathogens). The adenosine-to-inosine editing performed by ADAR1 is thought to change certain areas of the body's own RNA that the immune system might interpret as belonging to a virus that should be attacked. In this way, the protein helps the immune system avoid inappropriate targeting of the body's own tissues.The ADAR1 protein is also thought to inhibit the replication and spread of certain viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C, by modifying their RNA. In addition, the ADAR1 protein controls the function of certain chemical messengers called neurotransmitters at particular sites in the body by modifying the RNA blueprint for receptor proteins that interact with the neurotransmitters. Studies suggest that the ADAR1 protein may have other functions that are not well understood.","Aicardi-Goutières syndrome At least 30 ADAR gene mutations have been identified in people with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, a disorder that involves severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), skin lesions, immune system abnormalities, and other health problems. Some of these mutations lead to an ADAR1 protein that is less able to bind to RNA; others impair the protein's RNA editing function. As a result, control of the immune response is impaired and the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs, leading to the signs and symptoms of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. "
ADCY5 ,adenylate cyclase 5,"The ADCY5 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called adenylate cyclase 5. This enzyme helps convert a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to another molecule called cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). ATP is a molecule that supplies energy for cells' activities, including muscle contraction, and cAMP is involved in signaling for many cellular functions.","ADCY5-related dyskinesia At least six ADCY5 gene mutations have been identified in people with ADCY5-related dyskinesia, a disorder that causes abnormal involuntary movements. These mutations are thought to enhance adenylate cyclase 5 enzyme activity and lead to higher levels of cAMP within cells, so they are described as ""gain-of-function"" mutations. Other ADCY5 gene mutations prevent production of adenylate cyclase 5. It is unclear how either type of mutation leads to the abnormal movements that occur in this disorder. "
ADGRE2 ,adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E2,"The ADGRE2 gene provides instructions for making a protein found in several types of immune system cells, including mast cells. Mast cells, which are found in many body tissues including the skin, are important for the normal protective functions of the immune system. They also play a role in allergic reactions, which occur when the immune system overreacts to stimuli that are not harmful. The specific role of the ADGRE2 protein in mast cells is not well understood.The ADGRE2 protein consists of two parts (subunits) that interact with each other: an alpha subunit that lies on the outside surface of the cell and a beta subunit that crosses the cell membrane and extends into the cell.","Vibratory urticaria At least one mutation in the ADGRE2 gene has been identified in people with vibratory urticaria, a condition in which vibration, repetitive stretching, or friction on the skin results in allergy symptoms such as hives (urticaria), swelling (angioedema), redness (erythema), and itching (pruritus) in the affected area. The reaction can be brought on by towel drying, hand clapping, running, a bumpy ride in a vehicle, or other repetitive stimulation.The ADGRE2 gene mutation that causes vibratory urticaria, written as Cys492Tyr or C492Y, replaces the protein building block (amino acid) cysteine with the amino acid tyrosine at position 492 of the protein sequence. The substitution alters the protein structure and leads to a less stable interaction between the two subunits. This fragile connection can be more easily broken; vibration, friction, or stretching of the skin can disrupt the association between subunits in mast cells. Researchers suggest that once the subunits are disconnected, the beta subunit signals the mast cells to react and produce the allergy symptoms in the skin that occur in vibratory urticaria. "
ADGRG1 ,adhesion G protein-coupled receptor G1,"The ADGRG1 gene, formerly known as GPR56, provides instructions for making a protein that is critical for normal brain development. Before birth, the ADGRG1 protein appears to be essential for the normal growth and movement (migration) of nerve cells (neurons) in a part of the brain called the cerebral cortex. This outer layer of the brain carries out many important functions, such as sensation, voluntary muscle movement, thought, planning, and memory.Although the ADGRG1 protein has been studied most extensively in the brain, it is active in many of the body's tissues. This protein interacts with other proteins on the cell surface to trigger a series of chemical signals within the cell. Studies suggest that ADGRG1 signaling may play an important role in attaching cells to one another (cell adhesion).","Polymicrogyria At least eleven mutations in the ADGRG1 gene have been identified in people with a severe form of polymicrogyria called bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP). This disorder causes intellectual disability, delayed development, problems with speech and movement, and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). Most of the identified mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the ADGRG1 protein. These mutations interfere with the normal processing of the protein. The abnormal protein becomes trapped within the cell, where it is unable to reach the cell surface to carry out its normal signaling functions.A loss of ADGRG1 protein function likely disrupts the normal migration of neurons in the developing brain. As a result, certain regions of the cerebral cortex—areas known as the frontal and parietal lobes—develop too many folds (called gyri), and the folds are unusually small. These brain abnormalities cause intellectual disability and the other neurological problems associated with bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria. "
ADNP ,activity dependent neuroprotector homeobox,"The ADNP gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control the activity (expression) of other genes through a process called chromatin remodeling. Chromatin is the network of DNA and protein that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. Chromatin remodeling is one way gene expression is regulated during development; when DNA is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when DNA is loosely packed. As part of the remodeling process, the ADNP protein attaches to DNA and interacts with groups of proteins called SWI/SNF complexes, which direct changes in the structure of chromatin.By regulating gene expression, the ADNP protein is involved in many aspects of development. It is particularly important for regulation of genes involved in normal brain development, and it likely controls the activity of genes that direct the development and function of other body systems.","ADNP syndrome At least 22 ADNP gene mutations have been found to cause ADNP syndrome. This condition features intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, which is characterized by impaired communication and social interactions. Affected individuals can also have distinctive facial features and a wide variety of other signs and symptoms. Most ADNP gene mutations are thought to lead to the production of an abnormally short ADNP protein. Although it is unclear how these genetic changes cause ADNP syndrome, researchers speculate that the abnormally short protein can attach to DNA but cannot interact with SWI/SNF complexes. As a result, chromatin remodeling is impaired. Disturbance of this process alters the activity of many genes and disrupts the development or function of several of the body's tissues and organs, including the brain. These changes likely explain the intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and other diverse signs and symptoms of ADNP syndrome. "
ADSL ,adenylosuccinate lyase,"The ADSL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called adenylosuccinate lyase. This enzyme performs two steps in the process that produces (synthesizes) purine nucleotides. These nucleotides are building blocks of DNA, its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as ATP that serve as energy sources in the cell. Adenylosuccinate lyase and other enzymes involved in purine synthesis form a group of proteins (a protein complex) called the purinosome. This complex comes together when there is a shortage of purines or when a large amount of purines is needed, such as during cell division. As part of this complex, adenylosuccinate lyase converts a molecule called succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (SAICAR) to aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (AICAR) and converts succinyladenosine monophosphate (SAMP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP).","Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency More than 50 mutations in the ADSL gene have been found to cause adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency. This condition causes brain dysfunction (encephalopathy) that leads to delayed development of mental and motor skills (psychomotor delay), autistic behaviors that affect communication and social interaction, and seizures. Most of the mutations involved in this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the adenylosuccinate lyase enzyme. The altered enzymes have two to 20 percent of normal function, and studies suggest they are less able to form stable purinosomes.A reduction of adenylosuccinate lyase function, possibly due to a shortage of purinosomes, leads to buildup of SAICAR and SAMP. These substances are converted through a different reaction to succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICAr) and succinyladenosine (S-Ado). Detection of these substances in body fluids can help with diagnosis of adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency. Researchers believe that SAICAr and S-Ado are toxic; damage to brain tissue caused by one or both of these substances likely underlies the neurological problems that occur in adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency.Studies suggest that the amount of SAICAr relative to S-Ado reflects the severity of adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency. Individuals with more SAICAr than S-Ado have more severe encephalopathy and psychomotor delay. "
AFF2 ,AF4/FMR2 family member 2,"The AFF2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in the nucleus of cells but whose function is not well understood. Some studies suggest that it acts as a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of other genes, although the identity of these genes is unknown. Other studies show that the protein can attach to specific regions of messenger RNA (mRNA), which is a chemical cousin of DNA that serves as the genetic blueprint for protein production. It is thought that the AFF2 protein helps control the process by which the mRNA blueprint is cut and rearranged to produce different versions of proteins (alternative splicing).One region of the AFF2 gene contains a particular DNA segment known as a CCG trinucleotide repeat, so called because this segment of three DNA building blocks (nucleotides) is repeated multiple times within the gene. In most people, the number of CCG repeats ranges from 4 to about 40.","Fragile XE syndrome Mutations in the AFF2 gene cause fragile XE syndrome, a condition characterized by mild intellectual disability and learning difficulties. Nearly all cases are caused by a mutation called a CCG trinucleotide repeat expansion, in which the CCG trinucleotide is abnormally repeated more than 200 times, which makes this region of the gene unstable. As a result, the AFF2 gene is turned off (silenced), and no protein is produced from it. It is unclear how a shortage of this protein leads to problems with intellectual functioning.Rarely, small deletions of genetic material from the AFF2 gene are associated with fragile XE syndrome, although how these deletions affect the protein and lead to intellectual disability is unknown. "
AFF4 ,AF4/FMR2 family member 4,"The AFF4 gene provides instructions for making part of a protein complex called the super elongation complex (SEC). During embryonic development, the SEC is involved in an activity called transcription, which is the first step in the production of proteins from genes. By re-starting the transcription of certain genes after pauses that normally occur during the process, the SEC helps ensure that development proceeds appropriately before birth.","CHOPS syndrome Mutations in the AFF4 gene cause CHOPS syndrome, a disorder involving multiple abnormalities that are present from birth (congenital). The name ""CHOPS"" is an abbreviation for a list of features of the disorder including cognitive impairment, coarse facial features, heart defects, obesity, lung (pulmonary) involvement, short stature, and skeletal abnormalities.The AFF4 gene mutations identified in people with CHOPS syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the AFF4 protein. These mutations are thought to result in an AFF4 protein that is not broken down when it is no longer needed, so more AFF4 protein is available than usual. The excess AFF4 protein interferes with normal pauses in transcription. This dysregulation of transcription leads to problems in the development of multiple organs and tissues, resulting in the signs and symptoms of CHOPS syndrome. "
AGA ,aspartylglucosaminidase,"The AGA gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called aspartylglucosaminidase. This enzyme is active in lysosomes, which are structures inside cells that act as recycling centers. Within lysosomes, the enzyme helps break down complexes of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) attached to certain proteins (glycoproteins). Specifically, this enzyme cuts glycoproteins between a protein building block (amino acid) called asparagine and a sugar molecule called N-acetylglucosamine. This cut is one of the last steps in breaking down a glycoprotein in the lysosome.","Aspartylglucosaminuria More than 30 mutations in the AGA gene have been found to cause aspartylglucosaminuria. Most of these mutations change one amino acid in aspartylglucosaminidase. One mutation found in 98 percent of people with this condition in Finland replaces the amino acid cysteine with the amino acid serine at position 163 in the enzyme (written as Cys163Ser or C163S). Many mutations, including C163S, disrupt the proper folding of aspartylglucosaminidase, resulting in an enzyme that cannot effectively break down glycoproteins. A buildup of glycoproteins seems to particularly affect nerve cells in the brain; loss of these cells causes a progressive decline in mental functioning and the other signs and symptoms of aspartylglucosaminuria. "
AGL ,"amylo-alpha-1, 6-glucosidase, 4-alpha-glucanotransferase","The AGL gene provides instructions for making the glycogen debranching enzyme. This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of a complex sugar called glycogen, which is a major source of stored energy in the body. Glycogen is made up of several molecules of a simple sugar called glucose. Some glucose molecules are linked together in a straight line, while others branch off and form side chains. The glycogen debranching enzyme is involved in the breakdown of these side chains. The branched structure of glycogen makes it more compact for storage and allows it to break down more easily when it is needed for fuel.The AGL gene provides instructions for making several different versions (isoforms) of the glycogen debranching enzyme. These isoforms vary by size and are active (expressed) in different tissues.","Glycogen storage disease type III Approximately 100 mutations in the AGL gene have been found to cause glycogen storage disease type III (also called GSDIII or Cori disease). Most of these mutations lead to a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the glycogen debranching enzyme, resulting in a nonfunctional enzyme. As a result, the side chains of glycogen molecules cannot be removed and abnormal, partially broken down glycogen molecules are stored within cells. A buildup of abnormal glycogen damages organs and tissues throughout the body, particularly the liver and muscles, leading to the signs and symptoms of GSDIII.Mutations in the AGL gene can affect different isoforms of the enzyme, depending on where the mutations are located in the gene. For example, mutations that occur in a part of the AGL gene called exon 3 affect the isoform that is primarily expressed in the liver. These mutations almost always lead to GSD type IIIb, which is characterized by liver problems. "
AGPAT2 ,1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 2,"The AGPAT2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found in many of the body's cells and tissues. It plays a critical role in the growth and development of adipocytes, which are cells that store fats for energy. Adipocytes are the major component of the body's fatty (adipose) tissue.The AGPAT2 enzyme is part of a chemical pathway in many cells that produces two important types of fats (lipids): glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerols. Glycerophospholipids are the major component of cell membranes and are involved in chemical signaling within cells. Triacylglycerols (also known as triglycerides) are fat molecules that are stored in adipocytes for later conversion to energy.The AGPAT2 enzyme is responsible for a particular chemical reaction in the production of these two types of lipids. Specifically, the enzyme helps convert a molecule called lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to another molecule, phosphatidic acid (PA). Additional reactions convert phosphatidic acid to glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerols.","Congenital generalized lipodystrophy At least 26 mutations in the AGPAT2 gene have been identified in people with congenital generalized lipodystrophy (also called Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy) type 1. This rare condition is characterized by an almost total absence of adipose tissue and a very muscular appearance. A shortage of adipose tissue leads to multiple health problems, including high levels of triglycerides circulating in the bloodstream (hypertriglyceridemia) and diabetes mellitus.The AGPAT2 gene mutations that cause congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 1 greatly reduce or eliminate the activity of the AGPAT2 enzyme. Studies suggest that a loss of this enzyme's activity reduces the production and storage of triacylglycerols in adipocytes, which prevents these cells from storing fats. A lack of enzyme activity may also reduce the levels of glycerophospholipids in adipocytes, which changes the structure of the cell membrane and disrupts normal signaling within these cells. All of these abnormalities prevent the body from storing fats normally in adipose tissue. The resulting lack of body fat underlies the varied signs and symptoms of congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 1. "
AGPS ,alkylglycerone phosphate synthase,"The AGPS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme known as alkylglycerone phosphate synthase. This enzyme is found in structures called peroxisomes, which are sac-like compartments within cells that contain enzymes needed to break down many different substances. Peroxisomes are also important for the production of fats (lipids) used in digestion and in the nervous system.Within peroxisomes, alkylglycerone phosphate synthase is responsible for a critical step in the production of lipid molecules called plasmalogens. These molecules are found in cell membranes throughout the body. They are also abundant in myelin, which is the protective substance that covers nerve cells. However, little is known about the functions of plasmalogens. Researchers suspect that these molecules may help protect cells from oxidative stress, which occurs when unstable molecules called free radicals accumulate to levels that damage or kill cells. Plasmalogens may also play important roles in interactions between lipids and proteins, the transmission of chemical signals in cells, and the fusion of cell membranes.","Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata At least three mutations in the AGPS gene have been found to cause rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 3 (RCDP3). These mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in alkylglycerone phosphate synthase, which alters the structure of the enzyme and significantly reduces its activity. A shortage of functional alkylglycerone phosphate synthase disrupts peroxisome function and severely reduces the amount of plasmalogens within cells. It is unclear how these abnormalities lead to shortened long bones, intellectual disability, and the other characteristic features of RCDP3. "
AGT ,angiotensinogen,"The AGT gene provides instructions for making a protein called angiotensinogen. This protein is part of the renin-angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure and the balance of fluids and salts in the body. In the first step of this process, angiotensinogen is converted to angiotensin I. Through an additional step, angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to narrow (constrict), which results in increased blood pressure. This molecule also stimulates production of the hormone aldosterone, which triggers the absorption of salt and water by the kidneys. The increased amount of fluid in the body also increases blood pressure. Proper blood pressure during fetal growth, which delivers oxygen to the developing tissues, is required for normal development of the kidneys, particularly of structures called the proximal tubules, and other tissues. In addition, angiotensin II may play a more direct role in kidney development, perhaps by affecting growth factors involved in the development of kidney structures.","Renal tubular dysgenesis At least six mutations in the AGT gene have been found to cause a severe kidney disorder called renal tubular dysgenesis. This condition is characterized by abnormal kidney development before birth, the inability to produce urine (anuria), and severe low blood pressure (hypotension). These problems result in a reduction of amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios), which leads to a set of birth defects known as the Potter sequence.Renal tubular dysgenesis can be caused by mutations in both copies of any of the genes involved in the renin-angiotensin system. Most of the mutations in the AGT gene that cause this disorder change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the angiotensinogen protein. These changes occur in a region of the protein that is necessary for its conversion to angiotensin I. It is thought that the altered angiotensinogen cannot be converted, leading to a nonfunctional renin-angiotensin system. Without this system, the kidneys cannot control blood pressure. Because of low blood pressure, the flow of blood is reduced (hypoperfusion), and the body does not get enough oxygen during fetal development. As a result, kidney development is impaired, leading to the features of renal tubular dysgenesis. "
AGTR1 ,angiotensin II receptor type 1,"The AGTR1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1 receptor). This protein is part of the renin-angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure and the balance of fluids and salts in the body. Through a series of steps, the renin-angiotensin system produces a molecule called angiotensin II, which attaches (binds) to the AT1 receptor, stimulating chemical signaling. This signaling causes blood vessels to narrow (constrict), which results in increased blood pressure. Binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor also stimulates production of the hormone aldosterone, which triggers the absorption of water and salt by the kidneys. The increased amount of fluid in the body also increases blood pressure. Proper blood pressure during fetal growth, which delivers oxygen to the developing tissues, is required for normal development of the kidneys, particularly of structures called the proximal tubules, and other tissues. In addition, angiotensin II may play a more direct role in kidney development, perhaps by affecting growth factors involved in the development of kidney structures.","Renal tubular dysgenesis At least four mutations in the AGTR1 gene have been found to cause a severe kidney disorder called renal tubular dysgenesis. This condition is characterized by abnormal kidney development before birth, the inability to produce urine (anuria), and severe low blood pressure (hypotension). These problems result in a reduction of amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios), which leads to a set of birth defects known as the Potter sequence.Renal tubular dysgenesis can be caused by mutations in both copies of any of the genes involved in the renin-angiotensin system. The AGTR1 gene mutations that cause this disorder likely change or block the AT1 receptor's ability to stimulate signaling, which results in a nonfunctional renin-angiotensin system. Without this system, the kidneys cannot control blood pressure. Because of low blood pressure, the flow of blood is reduced (hypoperfusion), and the body does not get enough oxygen during fetal development. As a result, kidney development is impaired, leading to the features of renal tubular dysgenesis. "
AGXT ,alanine--glyoxylate and serine--pyruvate aminotransferase,"The AGXT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called serine-pyruvate aminotransferase. This enzyme is found in liver cells, specifically within cell structures called peroxisomes. These structures are important for several cellular activities, such as ridding the cell of toxic substances and helping to break down certain fats. In the peroxisome, serine-pyruvate aminotransferase converts a compound called glyoxylate to the protein building block (amino acid) glycine.","Primary hyperoxaluria More than 175 mutations in the AGXT gene have been found to cause primary hyperoxaluria type 1. This condition is caused by the overproduction of a substance called oxalate. Excess amounts of this substance lead to kidney and bladder stones, which can begin anytime from childhood to early adulthood with kidney disease developing at any age. Deposition of oxalate in multiple other tissues throughout the body (systemic oxalosis) can cause additional health problems.Most of the AGXT gene mutations decrease or eliminate serine-pyruvate aminotransferase activity, which impairs the conversion of glyoxylate to glycine. Other mutations cause the enzyme to be misplaced in cells, transporting it to structures called mitochondria instead of to peroxisomes. While the enzyme in the mitochondria retains activity, it cannot access glyoxylate, which is in peroxisomes. All AGXT gene mutations result in the accumulation of glyoxylate, which is converted to oxalate instead of glycine. The oxalate is filtered through the kidneys and is either excreted in urine as a waste product or combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate, a hard compound that is the main component of kidney and bladder stones. Increased oxalate levels in the blood can lead to systemic oxalosis, particularly affecting bones and the walls of blood vessels in people with primary hyperoxaluria type 1. "
AHCY ,adenosylhomocysteinase,"The AHCY gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase. This enzyme is involved in a multistep process that breaks down the protein building block (amino acid) methionine. Specifically, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase controls the step that converts the compound S-adenosylhomocysteine to the compounds adenosine and homocysteine. This reaction also plays an important role in regulating the addition of methyl groups, consisting of one carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms, to other compounds (methylation). Methylation is important in many cellular processes. These include determining whether the instructions in a particular segment of DNA are carried out, regulating reactions involving proteins and lipids, and controlling the processing of chemicals that relay signals in the nervous system (neurotransmitters).","Hypermethioninemia Three mutations in the AHCY gene have been described in people with hypermethioninemia. In a Croatian family, one mutation substitutes the amino acid cysteine for the amino acid tyrosine at protein position 143 (written as Tyr143Cys or Y143C). Another mutation replaces the amino acid tryptophan with a premature stop signal at position 112 (written as Trp112X or W112X), resulting in an enzyme that is abnormally short. A U.S. patient was found to have, in addition to the Y143C mutation, a mutation that substitutes the amino acid valine for the amino acid alanine at position 89 (written as Ala89Val or A89V). These mutations reduce the activity of the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase enzyme, resulting in the signs and symptoms of hypermethioninemia. "
AHDC1 ,AT-hook DNA binding motif containing 1,"The AHDC1 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not known. The AHDC1 protein is found in the nucleus of cells, and a region of the protein is thought to allow it to attach (bind) to DNA. Based on its location and possible DNA-binding ability, researchers suspect the protein may help control the activity of other genes.","Xia-Gibbs syndrome More than 25 mutations in the AHDC1 gene have been found to cause Xia-Gibbs syndrome, a neurological disorder characterized by intellectual disability and delayed speech development. A variety of other signs and symptoms can also occur in this disorder, such as weak muscle tone, growth impairment, and unusual facial features. Most of the AHDC1 gene mutations involved in Xia-Gibbs syndrome lead to production of abnormally short AHDC1 proteins. The effects of these changes in cells are unclear. The shortened proteins may be quickly broken down or be unable to function. Or, the abnormal proteins may interfere with the function of AHDC1 proteins produced from the normal copy of the gene. Some people with Xia-Gibbs syndrome have a mutation that removes (deletes) the AHDC1 gene (and other nearby genes), although it is unclear if such mutations cause the condition.Researchers suspect that a reduction in the amount of functional AHDC1 protein prevents normal brain development, leading to intellectual disability, speech problems, and other neurological features of Xia-Gibbs syndrome. Abnormal development of other body systems caused by a shortage of AHDC1 protein may account for additional signs and symptoms of the condition. "
AIP ,aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein,"The AIP gene provides instructions for making a protein called aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP). Although AIP's function is not well understood, it is known to interact with numerous other proteins, including one called the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Through these interactions, AIP likely helps regulate certain cell processes, such as the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and cell survival. This protein is thought to act as a tumor suppressor, which means it normally helps prevent cells from proliferating in an uncontrolled way.","Familial isolated pituitary adenoma Mutations in the AIP gene cause 15 to 25 percent of cases of familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA), an inherited condition characterized by development of a noncancerous tumor in the pituitary gland (called a pituitary adenoma). This small gland at the base of the brain produces hormones that control many important body functions. There are several types of pituitary adenomas categorized by the hormone they produce. Affected individuals within the same family may develop the same type of pituitary adenoma or different types. People with a mutation in the AIP gene most commonly develop a type of pituitary adenoma called a somatotropinoma. FIPA tumors caused by AIP gene mutations usually occur at a younger age and are larger than those without AIP gene mutations.Many kinds of mutations in the AIP gene have been identified in affected families. Some of these changes lead to an abnormally short protein or no protein at all. Other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in AIP. Although it is unclear how these mutations are involved in tumor development, researchers believe that the alterations disrupt interaction between AIP and one or more other proteins. The ability of AIP to control cell proliferation may be reduced, allowing pituitary cells to grow and divide unchecked and form a tumor. It is not known why the pituitary gland is specifically affected or why certain types of pituitary adenomas develop.Even before FIPA was defined as a condition, doctors recognized that somatotropinomas could occur in multiple members of a family. They referred to these tumors as isolated familial somatotropinoma. These tumors produce and release excess growth hormone (also called somatotropin), which promotes growth of the body. Because it can cause overgrowth of the hands, feet, and face (acromegaly), the condition is also referred to as familial isolated acromegaly. Later, researchers discovered that isolated familial somatotropinoma can be caused by mutations in the AIP gene, and these tumors are now considered part of FIPA. "
AIRE ,autoimmune regulator,"The AIRE gene provides instructions for making a protein called the autoimmune regulator. This protein is active primarily in the thymus, which is an organ located behind the breastbone that plays an important role in immune system function. The thymus prepares immune cells called T cells for their role in fighting infection; this process is called thymic education.For a person to remain healthy, immune system cells such as T cells must be able to identify and destroy potentially harmful invaders (such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses) while sparing the body's normal tissues. The autoimmune regulator protein plays an important role in this process by helping T cells distinguish the body's own proteins from those of foreign invaders. When this system malfunctions, the immune system's ability to distinguish between the body's proteins and foreign invaders is impaired, and it may attack the body's own tissues and organs. This abnormal reaction is called autoimmunity. In the thymus, the autoimmune regulator protein destroys T cells that otherwise would cause autoimmune damage.","Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy More than 90 mutations in the AIRE gene have been identified in people with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED). APECED is an inherited condition that affects many of the body's organs. A major feature of this disorder is chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), which is a tendency to develop infections of the skin, the nails, and the moist lining of body cavities (mucous membranes) caused by a type of fungus called Candida. Other common signs and symptoms of APECED involve dysfunction of the body's network of hormone-producing glands (the endocrine system), as well as other organs and tissues.The AIRE gene mutations that cause APECED lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the autoimmune regulator protein or change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in critical regions of the protein. These mutations reduce or eliminate the function of the autoimmune regulator protein. Without enough of this protein function, the immune system's ability to distinguish between the body's proteins and foreign invaders is impaired, and immune cells may attack the body's own organs, resulting in autoimmunity. This abnormal reaction leads to inflammation and can damage otherwise healthy cells and tissues. Autoimmune damage to the adrenal glands, parathyroid glands, and other organs underlies many of the major features of APECED.Studies suggest that AIRE gene mutations also result in immune substances (antibodies) mistakenly attacking proteins involved in an immune process called the IL-17 pathway, which is important in the body's defense against Candida. This pathway, which depends on specialized proteins called IL-17 cytokines for signaling, creates inflammation, sending additional cytokines and white blood cells to fight foreign invaders and promote tissue repair. In addition, the IL-17 pathway promotes the production of certain antimicrobial protein segments (peptides) that control growth of Candida on the surface of mucous membranes. By damaging IL-17 cytokines, AIRE gene mutations are thought to impair the IL-17 pathway's function, resulting in CMC in people with APECED. "
AKR1D1 ,aldo-keto reductase family 1 member D1,"The AKR1D1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 3-oxo-5-beta(β)-steroid 4-dehydrogenase. This enzyme is found in liver cells. It participates in the production of bile acids, which are a component of a digestive fluid called bile. Bile acids stimulate bile flow and helps absorb fats and fat-soluble vitamins. Bile acids are produced from cholesterol in a multi-step process. The 3-oxo-5-β-steroid 4-dehydrogenase enzyme is responsible for the third step in that process, which converts 7alpha(α)-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one to 7α-hydroxy-5β-cholesten-3-one.","Congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 2 More than 10 mutations in the AKR1D1 gene have been found to cause congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 2. This condition is characterized by cholestasis, a condition that impairs the production and release of a digestive fluid called bile from liver cells. Most of the AKR1D1 gene mutations replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the enzyme. These mutations result in production of a 3-oxo-5-β-steroid 4-dehydrogenase enzyme with severely reduced function. Without enough functional enzyme, the conversion of 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one to 7α-hydroxy-5β-cholesten-3-one is impaired. The 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one instead gets converted into abnormal bile acid compounds that cannot be transported out of the liver into the intestine, where the bile acids are needed to digest fats. This impaired production and release of bile acids leads to cholestasis. As a result, cholesterol and abnormal bile acids build up in the liver and fat-soluble vitamins are not absorbed, leading to the signs and symptoms of congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 2. "
AKT1 ,AKT serine/threonine kinase 1,"The AKT1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called AKT1 kinase. This protein is found in various cell types throughout the body, where it plays a critical role in many signaling pathways. For example, AKT1 kinase helps regulate cell growth and division (proliferation), the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and cell survival. AKT1 kinase also helps control apoptosis, which is the self-destruction of cells when they become damaged or are no longer needed.Signaling involving AKT1 kinase appears to be essential for the normal development and function of the nervous system. Studies have suggested a role for AKT1 kinase in cell-to-cell communication among nerve cells (neurons), neuronal survival, and the formation of memories.The AKT1 gene belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous.","Proteus syndrome At least one mutation in the AKT1 gene has been found to cause Proteus syndrome, a rare condition characterized by overgrowth of the bones, skin, and other tissues. This mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in AKT1 kinase. Specifically, it replaces the amino acid glutamic acid with the amino acid lysine at protein position 17 (written as Glu17Lys or E17K). The mutation is not inherited from a parent; in people with Proteus syndrome, the mutation arises randomly in one cell during the early stages of development before birth. As cells continue to grow and divide, some cells will have the mutation and other cells will not. This mixture of cells with and without a genetic mutation is known as mosaicism.The Glu17Lys mutation leads to the production of an overactive AKT1 kinase that is turned on when it should not be. The abnormally active protein disrupts a cell's ability to regulate its own growth, allowing the cell to grow and divide abnormally. Increased cell proliferation in various tissues and organs leads to the overgrowth characteristic of Proteus syndrome. Studies suggest that the AKT1 gene mutation is more common in groups of cells that experience overgrowth than in the parts of the body that grow normally. "
AKT3 ,AKT serine/threonine kinase 3,"The AKT3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is most active in the nervous system. The AKT3 protein is a key regulator of a chemical signaling pathway called the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. This signaling influences many critical cell functions, including the creation (synthesis) of new proteins, cell growth and division (proliferation), and the survival of cells. The PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is essential for the normal development of many parts of the body, including the brain. Studies suggest that the AKT3 protein plays a critical role in determining brain size.","Megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome Several mutations in the AKT3 gene have been found to cause megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndrome. This rare condition affects the development of the brain, causing an unusually large brain and head size (megalencephaly) and other abnormalities of the brain's structure.Each of the known mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the AKT3 protein. These changes are described as ""gain-of-function"" because they increase the activity of the protein. This enhanced activity increases chemical signaling through the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, which causes excessive cell growth and division. The increased number of cells leads to rapid and abnormal brain growth starting before birth. "
ALAD ,aminolevulinate dehydratase,"The ALAD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme known as delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase. This enzyme is involved in the production of a molecule called heme. Heme is vital for all of the body's organs, although it is found mostly in the blood, bone marrow, and liver. Heme is an essential component of several iron-containing proteins called hemoproteins, including hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in the blood).The production of heme is a multi-step process that requires eight different enzymes. Delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase is responsible for the second step in this process, which combines two molecules of delta-aminolevulinic acid (the product of the first step) to form a compound called porphobilinogen. In subsequent steps, four molecules of porphobilinogen are combined and then modified to produce heme.","Porphyria At least 10 mutations in the ALAD gene can cause a rare form of porphyria called ALAD deficiency porphyria. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase. These changes reduce the activity of the enzyme, allowing delta-aminolevulinic acid to build up to toxic levels in the body. This compound is formed during the normal process of heme production, but reduced activity of delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase allows it to accumulate to toxic levels. Very high levels of this compound can cause attacks of abdominal pain, vomiting, and other signs and symptoms of ALAD deficiency porphyria. "
ALAS2 ,5'-aminolevulinate synthase 2,"The ALAS2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 5'-aminolevulinate synthase 2 or erythroid ALA-synthase. This version of the enzyme is found only in developing red blood cells called erythroblasts.ALA-synthase plays an important role in the production of heme. Heme is a component of iron-containing proteins called hemoproteins, including hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in the blood). Heme is vital for all of the body's organs, although it is most abundant in the blood, bone marrow, and liver.The production of heme is a multi-step process that requires eight different enzymes. ALA-synthase is responsible for the first step in this process, the formation of a compound called delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). In subsequent steps, seven other enzymes produce and modify compounds that ultimately lead to heme.","Porphyria At least two ALAS2 gene mutations have been found in people with a form of porphyria known as X-linked dominant erythropoietic protoporphyria. Each of these mutations deletes a small amount of genetic material near the end of the ALAS2 gene. These changes overactivate erythroid ALA-synthase, which increases the production of ALA within red blood cells. The excess ALA is converted by other enzymes to compounds called porphyrins. If these compounds build up in erythroblasts, they can leak out and be transported through the bloodstream to the skin and other tissues. High levels of porphyrins in the skin cause the oversensitivity to sunlight that is characteristic of this condition. "
ALDH3A2 ,aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family member A2,"The ALDH3A2 gene is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) gene family. Genes in this family provide instructions for producing enzymes that alter molecules called aldehydes. The ALDH3A2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH). This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of fats, specifically the breakdown of molecules called fatty aldehydes to fatty acids. This conversion of molecules is part of a multistep process called fatty acid oxidation in which fats are broken down and converted into energy.The FALDH enzyme is found in most tissues, but its activity (expression) is highest in the liver. Within cells, the FALDH enzyme is located in the endoplasmic reticulum, a structure involved in protein processing and transport.","Sjögren-Larsson syndrome At least 80 mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene have been found to cause Sjögren-Larsson syndrome, a condition characterized by dry, scaly skin (ichthyosis); neurological abnormalities; and eye problems. Many of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the FALDH enzyme. The gene mutations that cause Sjögren-Larsson syndrome lead to the production of a FALDH enzyme that is unable to break down fatty aldehyde molecules. As a result, fats that are not broken down can build up in cells. In all affected tissues, excess fat accumulation interferes with the normal formation of protective membranes or materials that are necessary for the body to function normally. These abnormalities underlie the characteristic signs and symptoms of Sjögren-Larsson syndrome. "
ALDH4A1 ,aldehyde dehydrogenase 4 family member A1,"The ALDH4A1 gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase, which is found in tissues throughout the body. Within the cells of these tissues, this enzyme functions in energy-producing structures called mitochondria.Pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase starts the second step in the process that breaks down the protein building block (amino acid) proline. This step converts pyrroline-5-carboxylate, which is produced in the first step, to the amino acid glutamate. The conversion between proline and glutamate is important in maintaining a supply of the amino acids needed for protein production, and for energy transfer within the cell.","Hyperprolinemia Researchers have identified three mutations in the ALDH4A1 gene that eliminate the function of the pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase enzyme, causing hyperprolinemia type II. Two of these mutations add or delete a DNA building block (nucleotide), which introduces a premature stop signal that results in an abnormally shortened enzyme. The third mutation results in the substitution of the amino acid leucine for the amino acid serine at position 352 (written as Ser352Leu or S352L) in the pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase enzyme. Nonfunctional pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase leads to elevated levels of proline and a buildup of the intermediate breakdown product pyrroline-5-carboxylate, causing the signs and symptoms of hyperprolinemia type II. "
ALDH5A1 ,aldehyde dehydrogenase 5 family member A1,"The ALDH5A1 gene provides instructions for producing the succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase enzyme. This enzyme is found in the energy-producing centers of cells (mitochondria). Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase is involved in the breakdown of a chemical that transmits signals in the brain (neurotransmitter) called gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA). The primary role of GABA is to prevent the brain from being overloaded with too many signals. Once GABA molecules have been released from nerve cells, they are broken down by succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase and other enzymes.","Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency At least 35 mutations in the ALDH5A1 gene have been found to cause succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency. Most of these mutations change one protein building block (amino acid) in the succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase enzyme. Mutations in the ALDH5A1 gene lead to the production of an enzyme with little or no activity. A lack of functional succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase disrupts the conversion of succinic semialdehyde to succinic acid. Instead, succinic semialdehyde is converted back into GABA or to a related molecule, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). It is unclear how increases in GHB and GABA cause developmental delay, seizures, and other features of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency. "
ALDH7A1 ,aldehyde dehydrogenase 7 family member A1,"The ALDH7A1 gene is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) gene family. These genes provide instructions for producing enzymes that alter molecules called aldehydes. The ALDH7A1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called α-aminoadipic semialdehyde (α-AASA) dehydrogenase, also known as antiquitin. Within the cell, antiquitin is found in the internal fluid of the cell (cytosol) and in the nucleus. This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of the protein building block (amino acid) lysine in the brain. In one step in the breakdown of lysine to other molecules, antiquitin facilitates the conversion of α-aminoadipic semialdehyde to α-aminoadipate. The breakdown of lysine in the brain is necessary for energy production and to produce other needed molecules.","Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy A variety of mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene have been found to cause pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy. Most of these mutations are specific to single families. One mutation occurs in multiple people with this condition; it replaces the amino acid glutamine with the amino acid glycine at position 399 in the antiquitin protein (written as Glu399Gln or E399Q). All mutations that cause pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy produce a nonfunctional antiquitin protein. A shortage (deficiency) of antiquitin leads to the buildup of α-aminoadipic semialdehyde, resulting in a disruption in the activity of pyridoxine, a form of vitamin B6 derived from food. Pyridoxine plays a role many processes in the body, such as the breakdown of amino acids and chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters. It is unclear how a lack of pyridoxine causes the seizures characteristic of this condition. "
ALDOB ,"aldolase, fructose-bisphosphate B","The ALDOB gene provides instructions for making the aldolase B enzyme. This enzyme is one of a group of three aldolase enzymes that are responsible for breaking down certain molecules in cells throughout the body. Four identical aldolase B enzymes need to be attached (bound) to each other in a four-enzyme unit called a tetramer to work.Aldolase B is found primarily in the liver, but it is also present at lower levels in kidney and intestinal cells. Aldolase B is involved in the breakdown (metabolism) of the simple sugar fructose, which is found mostly in fruits and is used in the body for energy. Aldolase B is responsible for the second step in the metabolism of fructose, which breaks down the molecule fructose-1-phosphate into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. To a lesser degree, aldolase B is also involved in the breakdown of the simple sugar glucose.","Hereditary fructose intolerance More than 50 mutations in the ALDOB gene have been found to cause hereditary fructose intolerance, a condition characterized by nausea and intestinal discomfort following ingestion of foods containing fructose. Most of these mutations replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the aldolase B enzyme and result in the production of an enzyme with reduced function. A mutation found in approximately half of people with hereditary fructose intolerance replaces the amino acid alanine with the amino acid proline at position 149 in the enzyme (written as Ala149Pro or A149P). This mutation alters the 3-dimensional shape of the enzyme. Alteration of the shape of the enzyme makes it difficult for the aldolase B enzymes to bind together and form tetramers. If it is not in a tetramer, aldolase B cannot metabolize fructose.A lack of functional aldolase B results in an accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate in liver cells. This buildup is toxic, resulting in the death of liver cells over time. Additionally, the breakdown products of fructose-1-phosphase are needed in the body to produce energy and to maintain blood sugar levels. The combination of decreased cellular energy, low blood sugar, and liver cell death leads to the features of hereditary fructose intolerance. "
ALG1 ,"ALG1, chitobiosyldiphosphodolichol beta-mannosyltransferase","The ALG1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is involved in a process called glycosylation. During this process, complex chains of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) are attached to proteins and fats (lipids). Glycosylation modifies proteins so they can fully perform their functions and modifies lipids so they can help cells interact with each other. Oligosaccharides are made up of many sugar molecules that are attached to one another in a stepwise process, forming a complex chain. The enzyme produced from the ALG1 gene transfers a simple sugar called mannose to growing oligosaccharides at a particular step in the formation of the chain. Once the correct number of sugar molecules are linked together, the oligosaccharide is attached to a protein or lipid.","ALG1-congenital disorder of glycosylation At least 15 mutations in the ALG1 gene have been found to cause ALG1-congenital disorder of glycosylation (ALG1-CDG). This condition typically leads to intellectual disability, delayed development, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and other signs and symptoms that affect many body systems. Mutations in the ALG1 gene result in the production of an abnormal enzyme with little activity. The poorly functioning enzyme cannot add mannose to sugar chains efficiently, and the resulting oligosaccharides are often incomplete. Although the short oligosaccharides can be transferred to proteins and lipids, the process is not as efficient as with the full-length oligosaccharide. The wide variety of signs and symptoms in ALG1-CDG are likely due to impaired glycosylation of proteins and lipids that are needed for normal function of many organs and tissues. "
ALG6 ,"ALG6, alpha-1,3-glucosyltransferase","The ALG6 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is involved in a process called glycosylation. Glycosylation is a process by which sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) are attached to proteins and fats. Oligosaccharides are made up of many sugar molecules that are attached to one another in a stepwise process forming a complex chain. Glycosylation modifies proteins so they can perform a wider variety of functions. The enzyme produced from the ALG6 gene transfers a simple sugar called glucose to the growing oligosaccharide. Once the correct number of sugar molecules are linked together, the oligosaccharide is attached to a protein or fat.","ALG6-congenital disorder of glycosylation At least 20 mutations in the ALG6 gene have been found to cause ALG6-congenital disorder of glycosylation (ALG6-CDG, also known as congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ic). This condition typically leads to developmental delay, vision problems, seizures, and other signs and symptoms. Mutations in the ALG6 gene result in the production of an abnormal enzyme with reduced or no activity. A common mutation replaces the protein building block (amino acid) alanine with the amino acid valine at position 333 in the enzyme. This mutation, written as Ala333Val or A333V, results in an enzyme with reduced activity. Without a properly functioning enzyme, glycosylation cannot proceed normally, and oligosaccharides are incomplete. As a result, glycosylation is reduced or absent. The wide variety of signs and symptoms in ALG6-CDG are likely due to impaired glycosylation of proteins and fats that are needed for normal function in many organs and tissues, including the brain, eyes, and hormone-producing (endocrine) system. "
ALG12 ,"ALG12, alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase","The ALG12 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is involved in a process called glycosylation. During this process, complex chains of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) are attached to proteins and fats (lipids). Glycosylation modifies proteins so they can fully perform their functions. Oligosaccharides are made up of many sugar molecules that are attached to one another in a stepwise process, forming a complex chain. The enzyme produced from the ALG12 gene transfers a simple sugar called mannose to growing oligosaccharides at a particular step in the formation of the chain. Once the correct number of sugar molecules are linked together, the oligosaccharide is attached to a protein or lipid.","ALG12-congenital disorder of glycosylation At least 13 mutations in the ALG12 gene have been found to cause ALG12-congenital disorder of glycosylation (ALG12-CDG). This condition typically leads to delayed growth and development, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and other signs and symptoms. Mutations in the ALG12 gene result in the production of an abnormal enzyme with little activity. Without a properly functioning enzyme, mannose cannot be added to the chain efficiently, and the resulting oligosaccharides are often incomplete. Although the short oligosaccharides can be transferred to proteins and lipids, the process is not as efficient as with the full-length oligosaccharide. As a result, glycosylation is reduced. The wide variety of signs and symptoms in ALG12-CDG are likely due to impaired glycosylation of proteins and lipids that are needed for normal function in many organs and tissues, including the brain. "
ALK ,ALK receptor tyrosine kinase,"The ALK gene provides instructions for making a protein called ALK receptor tyrosine kinase, which is part of a family of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Receptor tyrosine kinases transmit signals from the cell surface into the cell through a process called signal transduction. The process begins when the kinase is stimulated at the cell surface and then attaches to a similar kinase (dimerizes). After dimerization, the kinase is tagged with a marker called a phosphate group (a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms) in a process called phosphorylation. Phosphorylation turns on (activates) the kinase. The activated kinase is able to transfer a phosphate group to another protein inside the cell, which is activated as a result. The activation continues through a series of proteins in a signaling pathway. These signaling pathways are important in many cellular processes such as cell growth and division (proliferation) or maturation (differentiation).Although the specific function of ALK receptor tyrosine kinase is unknown, it is thought to act early in development to help regulate the proliferation of nerve cells.","Neuroblastoma At least 16 mutations in the ALK gene have been identified in some people with neuroblastoma, a type of cancerous tumor composed of immature nerve cells (neuroblasts). Neuroblastoma and other cancers occur when a buildup of genetic mutations in critical genes—those that control cell proliferation or differentiation—allows cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In most cases, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are called somatic mutations. Somatic mutations are present only in certain cells and are not inherited. Less commonly, gene mutations that increase the risk of developing cancer can be inherited from a parent. Both types of mutation occur in neuroblastoma. Somatic mutations in the ALK gene occur during the development of some cases of sporadic neuroblastoma, and inherited mutations in the ALK gene increase the risk of developing familial neuroblastoma.Mutations in the ALK gene change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in ALK receptor tyrosine kinase. The most common mutation in neuroblastoma replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid glutamine at position 1275 (written as Arg1275Gln or R1275Q). Arg1275Gln has been found in both familial and sporadic neuroblastoma and is the only common ALK gene mutation that has been found in both types of the condition.Occasionally, extra copies of the ALK gene are found in people with neuroblastoma. This phenomenon, known as gene amplification, results in overexpression of ALK receptor tyrosine kinase.Mutated or overexpressed ALK receptor tyrosine kinase no longer requires stimulation from outside the cell to be phosphorylated. As a result, the kinase and the downstream signaling pathway are constantly turned on (constitutively activated). Constitutive activation of ALK receptor tyrosine kinase may increase the proliferation of immature nerve cells, leading to neuroblastoma. "
ALMS1 ,"ALMS1, centrosome and basal body associated protein","The ALMS1 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. Researchers believe that the protein may play a role in hearing, vision, regulation of body weight, and functions of the heart, kidney, lungs, and liver. It may also affect how the pancreas regulates insulin, a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels.The ALMS1 protein is present in most of the body's tissues, usually at low levels. Within cells, this protein is located in structures called centrosomes. Centrosomes play a role in cell division and the assembly of microtubules, which are proteins that transport materials in cells and help the cell maintain its shape. The ALMS1 protein is also found at the base of cilia, which are finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. Almost all cells have cilia at some stage of their life cycle. Cilia are involved in cell movement and many different chemical signaling pathways. Based on its location within cells, researchers suggest that the ALMS1 protein might be involved in the organization of microtubules, the transport of various materials, and the normal function of cilia.","Alström syndrome More than 80 mutations in the ALMS1 gene have been identified in people with Alström syndrome. Most of these mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small version of the ALMS1 protein that does not function properly. Researchers propose that a lack of normally functioning ALMS1 protein in the brain could lead to overeating. A loss of this protein in the pancreas may cause insulin resistance, a condition in which the body cannot use insulin properly. The combined effects of overeating and insulin resistance impair the body's ability to handle excess sugar, leading to diabetes and obesity (two common features of Alström syndrome). It is unclear how ALMS1 mutations cause the other signs and symptoms of Alström syndrome. Researchers suspect that this condition is associated with malfunctioning cilia in many of the body's tissues and organs. "
ALOX12B ,"arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase, 12R type","The ALOX12B gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 12R-LOX. This enzyme is part of a family of enzymes called arachidonate lipoxygenases. Most of these enzymes help add an oxygen molecule to a particular fatty acid called arachidonic acid. Arachidonate lipoxygenases add oxygen molecules at different locations on the arachidonic acid molecule, producing a variety of substances called fatty acid hydroperoxides. The fatty acid hydroperoxides are then processed into molecules that play an important role in chemical signaling within cells.Specifically, the 12R-LOX enzyme helps add an oxygen molecule to arachidonic acid to make a substance called 12R-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12R-HPETE). 12R-HPETE is later converted to a signaling molecule that is involved in the formation of the layers of fats (lipids) within the outermost layer of the skin (the epidermis). The lipid layers are necessary to prevent water loss (dehydration) through the skin.","Nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma More than 55 mutations in the ALOX12B gene have been found to cause nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NBCIE). This condition affects the skin and causes redness; the development of fine, white scales; an increased risk of infections; and excessive dehydration. Most of the mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the 12R-LOX enzyme. Many ALOX12B gene mutations lead to the production of a nonfunctional 12R-LOX enzyme, which disrupts the processing of the molecules involved in the formation of the lipid layer within the epidermis. Problems with this protective barrier underlie the skin abnormalities and other features of NBCIE. "
ALOXE3 ,arachidonate lipoxygenase 3,"The ALOXE3 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called eLOX3. This enzyme is part of a family of enzymes called arachidonate lipoxygenases. Most enzymes in this family help add an oxygen molecule to certain fatty acids to produce substances called fatty acid hydroperoxides.Unlike other lipoxygenases, the eLOX3 enzyme does not act directly on fatty acids. Instead, it is involved in the step following the creation of fatty acid hydroperoxides. The eLOX3 enzyme processes fatty acid hydroperoxides, which are later converted to signaling molecules that are involved in the formation of the layers of fats (lipids) within the outermost layer of the skin (the epidermis). The lipid layers are necessary to prevent water loss (dehydration) through the skin.","Nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma At least 20 mutations in the ALOXE3 gene have been found to cause nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NBCIE). This condition affects the skin and causes redness; the development of fine, white scales; an increased risk of infections; and excessive dehydration. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the eLOX3 enzyme. Many ALOXE3 gene mutations lead to the production of a nonfunctional eLOX3 enzyme, which disrupts the processing of the molecules involved in the formation of the lipid layers within the epidermis. Problems with this protective barrier underlie the skin abnormalities and other features of NBCIE. "
ALPL ,"alkaline phosphatase, biomineralization associated","The ALPL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). This enzyme plays an important role in the growth and development of bones and teeth. It is also active in many other tissues, particularly in the liver and kidneys. This enzyme acts as a phosphatase, which means that it removes clusters of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (phosphate groups) from other molecules.TNSALP is essential for the process of mineralization, in which minerals such as calcium and phosphorus are deposited in developing bones and teeth. Mineralization is critical for the formation of bones that are strong and rigid and teeth that can withstand chewing and grinding.","Hypophosphatasia About 300 mutations in the ALPL gene have been identified in people with hypophosphatasia. Most of these mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in TNSALP. Other mutations insert or delete genetic material in the ALPL gene or change the way the gene's instructions are used to build the enzyme.Mutations in the ALPL gene lead to the production of an abnormal version of TNSALP that cannot participate effectively in the mineralization of developing bones and teeth. A shortage of functional TNSALP allows substances that are normally processed by the enzyme to build up in the body. Researchers believe that a buildup of one of these compounds, inorganic pyrophosphate, underlies the defective mineralization of bones and teeth in people with hypophosphatasia.ALPL mutations that almost completely eliminate the activity of TNSALP usually result in the more severe forms of hypophosphatasia. Other mutations, which reduce but do not eliminate the activity of the enzyme, are often responsible for milder forms of the condition. "
ALS2 ,"ALS2, alsin Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor","The ALS2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called alsin. Alsin is produced in a wide range of tissues, with highest amounts in the brain. This protein is particularly abundant in motor neurons, the specialized nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control the movement of muscles.Alsin turns on (activates) multiple proteins called GTPases that convert a molecule called GTP into another molecule called GDP. GTPases play important roles in cell division, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). The GTPases play important roles in several cell processes. The GTPases that are activated by alsin are involved in the proper placement of the various proteins and fats that make up the cell membrane, the transport of molecules from the cell membrane to the interior of the cell (endocytosis), and the development of specialized structures called axons and dendrites that project from neurons and are essential for the transmission of nerve impulses.",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Genetics Home Reference provides information about amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 
ALX1 ,ALX homeobox 1,"The ALX1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is a member of the homeobox protein family. Homeobox proteins direct the formation of body structures during early embryonic development. The ALX1 protein is necessary for normal development of the head and face, particularly the formation of the eyes, nose, and mouth, which begins around the fourth week of development. The ALX1 protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to DNA and controls the activity of certain genes. Specifically, the protein controls the activity of genes that regulate cell growth and division (proliferation) and movement (migration), ensuring that cells grow and stop growing at specific times and that they are positioned correctly during development.","Frontonasal dysplasia At least three mutations in the ALX1 gene have been found to cause frontonasal dysplasia. ALX1 gene mutations cause a form of the disorder called frontonasal dysplasia type 3, which is characterized by severe malformations of the structures at the center of the face. ALX1 gene mutations that cause this condition alter the protein's structure and impair its ability to bind to DNA and regulate gene function. As a result, the proliferation and migration of cells during development is not controlled, which can lead to small or missing eyes, openings (clefts) in the nose or mouth, and other severe facial malformations characteristic of frontonasal dysplasia type 3. "
ALX3 ,ALX homeobox 3,"The ALX3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is a member of the homeobox protein family. Homeobox proteins direct the formation of body structures during early embryonic development. The ALX3 protein is necessary for normal development of the head and face, particularly the formation of the nose, which begins around the fourth week of development. The ALX3 protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to DNA and controls the activity of certain genes. Specifically, the protein controls the activity of genes that regulate cell growth and division (proliferation) and movement (migration), ensuring that cells grow and stop growing at specific times and that they are positioned correctly during development.","Frontonasal dysplasia At least seven mutations in the ALX3 gene have been found to cause frontonasal dysplasia. ALX3 gene mutations cause a form of the disorder called frontonasal dysplasia type 1, which particularly affects the development of the nose and surrounding tissues. ALX3 gene mutations that cause this condition severely reduce or eliminate the function of the ALX3 protein. As a result, the protein cannot bind to DNA and regulate gene function, which leads to poorly controlled cell proliferation and migration during development. This abnormal cell growth and movement impairs development of structures in the middle of the face, particularly the nose, leading to openings (clefts) in the nose. This abnormal development can also interfere with the proper formation of the skull, leading to the skull malformations typical of frontonasal dysplasia type 1. "
ALX4 ,ALX homeobox 4,"The ALX4 gene provides instructions for making a member of the homeobox protein family. Homeobox proteins direct the formation of body structures during early embryonic development. The ALX4 protein is necessary for normal development of the skull and formation of the head and face, which begins early in fetal development. This protein is also involved in the formation of skin layers, but its role in this process is poorly understood.The ALX4 protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to DNA and controls the activity of certain genes. Specifically, the protein controls the activity of genes that regulate cell growth and division (proliferation), cell maturation and specialization (differentiation), cell movement (migration), and cell survival. The regulation of these functions ensures that cells start and stop growing at specific times and that they are positioned correctly during development.","Enlarged parietal foramina At least eight mutations in the ALX4 gene have been found to cause enlarged parietal foramina type 2. This condition is characterized by enlarged openings (foramina) in the parietal bones, which are the two bones that form the top and sides of the skull. Openings in the parietal bones are normal during fetal development, but they usually close before birth. In people with this condition, the parietal foramina remain open throughout life.The mutations that cause enlarged parietal foramina result in the production of an ALX4 protein that cannot bind to DNA, which alters the regulation of multiple genes. As a result, several cell processes are disrupted, including proliferation, differentiation, and survival. In early development, the skull seems to be particularly sensitive to changes in ALX4 protein activity. Specifically, cells in the skull that are involved in bone formation (ossification) cannot function normally, leading to a lack of bone in areas of the skull and resulting in enlarged parietal foramina. "
AMACR ,alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase,"The AMACR gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR). This enzyme is found in the energy-producing centers in cells (mitochondria) and in cell structures called peroxisomes. Peroxisomes contain a variety of enzymes that break down many different substances, including fatty acids and certain toxic compounds. They are also important for the production (synthesis) of fats (lipids) used in digestion and in the nervous system.In peroxisomes, the AMACR enzyme plays a role in the breakdown of a fatty acid called pristanic acid, which comes from meat and dairy foods in the diet. In mitochondria, AMACR is thought to help further break down the molecules derived from pristanic acid.","Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase deficiency Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) deficiency is caused by mutations in the AMACR gene. This disorder leads to a variety of neurological problems that begin in adulthood, including gradual loss in intellectual functioning (cognitive decline), seizures, and weakness and loss of sensation in the limbs due to nerve damage (sensorimotor neuropathy). Most individuals with AMACR deficiency have an AMACR gene mutation that replaces a protein building block (amino acid) called serine with an amino acid called proline at position 52 in the enzyme sequence, written as Ser52Pro or S52P. This mutation results in a lack (deficiency) of functional enzyme. The enzyme deficiency leads to accumulation of pristanic acid in the blood. However, it is unclear how this accumulation is related to the specific signs and symptoms of AMACR deficiency. "
AMELX ,amelogenin X-linked,"The AMELX gene provides instructions for making a protein called amelogenin, which is essential for normal tooth development. Amelogenin is involved in the formation of enamel, which is the hard, white material that forms the protective outer layer of each tooth. Enamel is composed mainly of mineral crystals. These microscopic crystals are arranged in organized bundles that give enamel its strength and durability. Although the exact function of amelogenin is not well understood, it appears to separate and support the crystals as they grow. Amelogenin is removed from the developing crystals when it is no longer needed, leaving mature enamel that contains very little protein.One copy of the amelogenin gene is located on each of the sex chromosomes (the X and Y chromosomes). The AMELX gene, which is located on the X chromosome, makes almost all of the body's amelogenin. The copy of the amelogenin gene on the Y chromosome, AMELY, makes very little amelogenin and is not needed for enamel formation.",Amelogenesis imperfecta At least 23 mutations in the AMELX gene have been identified in people with an X-linked form of a disorder of tooth development called amelogenesis imperfecta. (X-linked disorders are caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome.) Some AMELX gene mutations lead to the production of an abnormal version of the amelogenin protein that can interfere with the formation and organization of enamel crystals. Other AMELX gene mutations prevent one copy of the gene from producing any amelogenin protein at all. Enamel cannot form properly without an adequate amount of amelogenin.Males have a single copy of the X chromosome in each cell. Males who inherit an altered copy of the AMELX gene have very little amelogenin and develop almost no enamel to cover and protect their teeth. (The normal AMELY gene on the Y chromosome does not provide enough amelogenin to compensate.) Females have two copies of the X chromosome in each cell. Females who inherit one altered copy of the AMELX gene are less severely affected than males because they have a normal copy of the gene on the other X chromosome to produce amelogenin. Their tooth enamel may have structural defects such as a distinctive pattern of vertical grooves. 
AMER1 ,APC membrane recruitment protein 1,"The AMER1 gene provides instructions for making a protein found in tissues throughout the body where it helps regulate the Wnt signaling pathway, which is a series of chemical signals that affect the way cells and tissues develop. Wnt signaling is important for cell division, attachment of cells to one another (adhesion), cell movement (migration), and many other cell activities. The AMER1 protein can promote cell growth by helping to turn on (activate) the Wnt pathway or prevent cell growth by helping to turn off (repress) the Wnt pathway. When repressing the pathway, the AMER1 protein is acting as a tumor suppressor, which means that it helps prevent cells from growing and dividing (proliferating) too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.","Wilms tumor Mutations in the AMER1 gene have been found in Wilms tumor, a rare form of kidney cancer that occurs almost exclusively in children. These mutations are somatic, meaning that they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in kidney cells that give rise to the tumor. AMER1 gene mutations result in a protein with a reduced ability to repress Wnt signaling. As a result, Wnt signaling is increased, which leads to the unchecked proliferation of kidney cells and tumor development. "
AMH ,anti-Mullerian hormone,"The AMH gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in male sex differentiation. During development of male fetuses, the AMH protein is produced and released (secreted) by cells of the testes. The secreted protein attaches (binds) to its receptor, which is found on the surface of Müllerian duct cells. The Müllerian duct, found in both male and female fetuses, is the precursor to the female reproductive organs. Binding of the AMH protein to its receptor induces self-destruction (apoptosis) of the Müllerian duct cells. As a result, the Müllerian duct breaks down (regresses) in males. In females, who do not produce the AMH protein during fetal development, the Müllerian duct becomes the uterus and fallopian tubes.","Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome type 1, a disorder of sexual development that affects males, is caused by mutations in the AMH gene. Males with this condition have female reproductive organs in addition to normal male reproductive organs. At least 38 mutations in the AMH gene have been identified in people with persistent Müllerian duct syndrome type 1. Most mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the AMH protein. Other mutations result in a premature stop signal that leads to an abnormally short protein. Still other mutations delete regions of DNA from the AMH gene, which changes the instructions for the protein.The mutated AMH protein cannot be released from the cells of the testes or cannot bind to the receptor on the Müllerian duct cells. As a result, the Müllerian duct cells never receive the signal for apoptosis. The Müllerian duct persists and becomes a uterus and fallopian tubes. Because the AMH protein is not involved in the formation of male reproductive organs, affected males also have male reproductive organs. "
AMHR2 ,anti-Mullerian hormone receptor type 2,"The AMHR2 gene provides instructions for making the anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) receptor type 2, which is involved in male sex differentiation. The AMH receptor type 2 is found on the surface of Müllerian duct cells. The Müllerian duct, found in both male and female fetuses, is the precursor to the female reproductive organs. During development of male fetuses, cells of the testes release a protein called the AMH protein. The AMH protein attaches (binds) to the AMH receptor type 2, which signals self-destruction (apoptosis) of the Müllerian duct cells. As a result, the Müllerian duct breaks down (regresses) in males. In females, who do not produce the AMH protein during fetal development, the Müllerian duct becomes the uterus and fallopian tubes.","Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome type 2, a disorder of sexual development that affects males, is caused by mutations in the AMHR2 gene. Males with this condition have female reproductive organs in addition to normal male reproductive organs. At least 24 mutations in the AMHR2 gene have been identified in people with persistent Müllerian duct syndrome type 2. Most mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the AMH receptor type 2 protein. Other mutations result in a premature stop signal that leads to an abnormally short protein. Still other mutations delete regions of DNA from the AMHR2 gene, which changes the instructions for the protein. The most common mutation, a deletion of 27 DNA building blocks (nucleotides), occurs in about half of affected individuals with an AMHR2 gene mutation.Mutations in the AMHR2 gene lead to an abnormal protein that is stuck inside the Müllerian duct cells and not found on the surface. Therefore, the cells cannot receive the signal for apoptosis. As a result, the Müllerian duct persists and becomes a uterus and fallopian tubes. Because the AMH receptor type 2 is not involved in the formation of male reproductive organs, affected males also have male reproductive organs. "
AMN ,amnion associated transmembrane protein,"The AMN gene provides instructions for making a protein called amnionless. This protein is involved in the uptake of vitamin B12 (also called cobalamin) from food. Vitamin B12, which cannot be made in the body and can only be obtained from food, is essential for the formation of DNA and proteins, the production of cellular energy, and the breakdown of fats. This vitamin is involved in the formation of red blood cells and maintenance of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).The amnionless protein is primarily found embedded in the outer membrane of kidney cells and cells that line the small intestine. Amnionless attaches (binds) to another protein called cubilin, anchoring cubilin to the cell membrane. Cubilin can interact with molecules and proteins passing through the intestine or kidneys. During digestion, vitamin B12 is released from food. As the vitamin passes through the small intestine, cubilin binds to it. Amnionless helps transfer the cubilin-vitamin B12 complex into the intestinal cell. From there, the vitamin is released into the blood and transported throughout the body. In the kidneys, amnionless and cubilin are involved in the reabsorption of certain proteins that would otherwise be released in urine.","Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome At least 30 mutations in the AMN gene have been found to cause Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome. This condition is characterized by low levels of vitamin B12 in the body, which leads to a blood disorder known as megaloblastic anemia. About half of affected individuals also have excess protein in their urine (proteinuria), and some have neurological problems.AMN gene mutations that cause Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome reduce the amount or function of the amnionless protein. Without amnionless acting as an anchor, cubilin is not attached to cells in the small intestine or kidneys and cannot bind to vitamin B12 and other molecules and proteins needed in the body. As a result, instead of being taken into intestinal cells, vitamin B12 is released from the body. A shortage of this essential vitamin impairs the proper development of red blood cells, leading to megaloblastic anemia. Low levels of vitamin B12 can also affect the central nervous system, causing neurological problems. In addition, without amnionless function in the kidneys, proteins are not reabsorbed into the body and are instead released in the urine, leading to proteinuria. "
AMPD1 ,adenosine monophosphate deaminase 1,"The AMPD1 gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called adenosine monophosphate (AMP) deaminase. This enzyme is found in the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles), where it plays a role in producing energy. Specifically, during physical activity, this enzyme converts a molecule called adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to a molecule called inosine monophosphate (IMP) as part of a process called the purine nucleotide cycle. This cycle reuses molecules called purines, which are a group of building blocks of DNA (nucleotides), its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as AMP that serve as energy sources in the cell. As part of the purine nucleotide cycle, AMP deaminase converts AMP to IMP, and as the cycle continues, molecules are produced that the muscle cells can use for energy. Skeletal muscle cells need energy to function and move the body.","Adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency At least nine mutations in the AMPD1 gene have been found to cause AMP deaminase deficiency. This condition is characterized by skeletal muscle pain or weakness after exercise or prolonged physical activity (exercise intolerance). Most cases are caused by a mutation that results in a premature stop signal in the instructions for making AMP deaminase (written as Gly12Ter or Q12X). The resulting enzyme is abnormally short and nonfunctional and cannot participate in the purine nucleotide cycle. As a result, the process stalls and energy production in skeletal muscle cells is decreased. Skeletal muscles are particularly sensitive to decreases in energy during periods of exercise or increased activity when energy demands increase. The lack of AMP deaminase as a source of energy production can result in fatigue and muscle weakness or pain in some people with AMP deaminase deficiency.It is not known why some people with this condition do not experience symptoms. Researchers speculate that additional factors, both genetic and environmental, may determine whether a person develops the signs and symptoms of AMP deaminase deficiency. "
AMT ,aminomethyltransferase,"The AMT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aminomethyltransferase. This enzyme is one of four components (subunits) that make up a large complex called glycine cleavage enzyme. Within cells, this complex is active in specialized energy-producing centers called mitochondria.As its name suggests, glycine cleavage enzyme processes a molecule called glycine by cutting (cleaving) it into smaller pieces. Glycine is an amino acid, which is a building block of proteins. This molecule also acts as a neurotransmitter, which is a chemical messenger that transmits signals in the brain. The breakdown of excess glycine is necessary for the normal development and function of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.","Glycine encephalopathy Mutations in the AMT gene are responsible for 10 percent to 15 percent of all cases of glycine encephalopathy. More than a dozen mutations have been identified in affected individuals. Most of these genetic changes alter single amino acids in aminomethyltransferase. Other mutations delete genetic material from the AMT gene or disrupt how genetic information from the gene is spliced together to make a blueprint for producing aminomethyltransferase.AMT mutations alter the structure and function of aminomethyltransferase. When an altered version of this enzyme is incorporated into the glycine cleavage enzyme complex, it prevents the complex from breaking down glycine properly. As a result, excess glycine can build up to toxic levels in the body's organs and tissues. Damage caused by harmful amounts of this molecule in the brain and spinal cord is responsible for the intellectual disability, seizures, and breathing difficulties characteristic of glycine encephalopathy. "
ANK1 ,ankyrin 1,"The ANK1 gene provides instruction for making a protein called ankyrin-1. This protein is primarily active (expressed) in red blood cells, but it is also found in muscle and brain cells. In red blood cells, ankyrin-1 is located at the cell membrane, where it attaches (binds) to other membrane proteins. The binding of membrane proteins to one another maintains the stability and structure of red blood cells but also allows for their flexibility. The proteins allow the cell to change shape without breaking when passing through narrow blood vessels.In muscle and brain cells, ankyrin-1 performs similar functions, binding to other membrane proteins to play a role in cell stability, cell movement, and other cell functions.","Hereditary spherocytosis At least 55 mutations in the ANK1 gene have been found to cause hereditary spherocytosis. Some of these mutations delete small pieces of genetic material, and others change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the ANK1 gene. These mutations lead to the production of an ankyrin-1 protein that does not function normally and does not bind to other proteins within the red blood cell membrane. A lack of normal ankyrin-1 at the cell membrane also leads to a lack of another protein called spectrin because ankyrin-1 is not available to bind to spectrin. The shortage (deficiency) of these two proteins interferes with the structure and flexibility of the red blood cell membrane, causing red blood cells to be misshapen. These misshapen cells, called spherocytes, are removed from circulation and taken to the spleen for destruction. The shortage of red blood cells in circulation and the abundance of cells in the spleen are responsible for the signs and symptoms of hereditary spherocytosis. "
ANK2 ,ankyrin 2,"The ANK2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ankyrin-B. Ankyrin-B is part of a family of ankyrin proteins, which interact with many other types of proteins in cells throughout the body. Ankyrins help organize the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton) and link certain proteins that span the cell membrane to this framework. Additionally, ankyrins play key roles in important functions including cell movement (migration) and cell growth and division (proliferation).The ankyrin-B protein is active in many cell types, particularly in the brain and in heart (cardiac) muscle. This protein mainly interacts with ion channels and ion transporters, which are complexes of proteins that move charged atoms (ions) across cell membranes. In the heart, the flow of ions (such as sodium, potassium, and calcium) through ion channels and ion transporters generates the electrical signals that control the heartbeat and maintain a normal heart rhythm. Ankyrin-B ensures these channels and transporters are in their proper locations in the cell membrane so they can regulate the flow of ions into and out of cardiac muscle cells. In addition, ankyrin-B helps ensure that signaling molecules that regulate the activity of ion channels and ion transporters are in the proper location.","Ankyrin-B syndrome At least ten mutations in the ANK2 gene have been found to cause ankyrin-B syndrome, a condition characterized by a variety of heart problems. Most often, mutations in the ANK2 gene lead to abnormalities of the heart's natural pacemaker (the sinoatrial node), a heart rate that is slower than normal (bradycardia), a disruption in the rhythm of the heart (arrhythmia), and an increased risk of fainting (syncope) and sudden death.Each of the identified mutations in the ANK2 gene changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the ankyrin-B protein. Most of these mutations alter a region of the ankyrin-B protein important for its function. At least one ANK2 gene mutation prevents ankyrin-B from getting to the cell membrane where it is needed to function. As a result of these genetic changes, the ankyrin-B protein cannot target ion channels and ion transporters to their correct locations in cardiac muscle cells. Although the channels and transporters are produced normally by the cell, they are unable to function if they are not inserted correctly into the cell membrane. This loss of functional channels and transporters in the heart disrupts the normal flow of ions, which alters the heart's normal rhythm and leads to the heart problems that can be a part of ankyrin-B syndrome. "
ANKH ,ANKH inorganic pyrophosphate transport regulator,"The ANKH gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in skeletal development. The ANKH protein plays a role in the development and function of cells that build bones (osteoblasts) and cells that break down bone (osteoclasts). Osteoclasts are involved in bone remodeling, a normal process in which old bone is removed and new bone is created to replace it. In addition, the ANKH protein transports a molecule called pyrophosphate out of cells to the intricate network of proteins that forms in the spaces between cells (extracellular matrix). This extracellular pyrophosphate helps regulate bone formation by preventing mineralization, the process by which minerals such as calcium and phosphorus are deposited in tissues. The ANKH protein may have other, unknown functions.","Craniometaphyseal dysplasia More than 10 mutations in the ANKH gene have been found to cause autosomal dominant craniometaphyseal dysplasia, a condition characterized by thickening of bones in the skull (cranium) and widening of a region at the end of long bones known as the metaphysis. Some mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the ANKH protein, whereas others insert or delete one or more amino acids in the protein. These changes disrupt the functioning of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In particular, the maturation (differentiation) of osteoclasts is impaired, which likely disrupts bone remodeling. Reduced breakdown of bone tissue can contribute to the bone thickening characteristic of craniometaphyseal dysplasia. The altered ANKH proteins may also be less able to transport pyrophosphate out of cells. A shortage of extracellular pyrophosphate can increase bone mineralization, which may also contribute to the bone abnormalities. "
ANKRD11 ,ankyrin repeat domain 11,"The ANKRD11 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ankyrin repeat domain 11 (ANKRD11). As its name suggests, this protein contains multiple regions called ankyrin domains; proteins with these domains help other proteins interact with each other. The ANKRD11 protein interacts with certain proteins called histone deacetylases, which are important for controlling gene activity. Through these interactions, ANKRD11 affects when genes are turned on and off. For example, ANKRD11 brings together histone deacetylases and other proteins called p160 coactivators. This association regulates the ability of p160 coactivators to turn on gene activity. ANKRD11 may also enhance the activity of a protein called p53, which controls the growth and division (proliferation) and the self-destruction (apoptosis) of cells.The ANKRD11 protein is found in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. During embryonic development, ANKRD11 helps regulate the proliferation of these cells and development of the brain. Researchers speculate that the protein may also be involved in the ability of neurons to change and adapt over time (plasticity), which is important for learning and memory. ANKRD11 may function in other cells in the body and appears to be involved in normal bone development.","KBG syndrome Several ANKRD11 gene mutations have been found to cause KBG syndrome, a condition characterized by large upper front teeth and other unusual facial features, skeletal abnormalities, and intellectual disability. Most of these mutations lead to an abnormally short ANKRD11 protein, which likely has little or no function. Reduction of this protein's function is thought to underlie the signs and symptoms of the condition. Because ANKRD11 is thought to play an important role in neurons and brain development, researchers speculate that a partial loss of its function may lead to developmental delay and intellectual disability in KBG syndrome. However, the mechanism is not fully known. It is also unclear how loss of ANKRD11 function leads to the skeletal features of the condition.Another type of mutation that affects the ANKRD11 gene, called 16q24.3 microdeletion, deletes genetic material from chromosome 16 in a region designated q24.3. The deleted region typically removes the ANKRD11 and ZNF778 genes, although other nearby genes may also be affected. People with this type of mutation have similar signs and symptoms to those of KBG syndrome, including unusual facial features and intellectual disability. Many also have brain abnormalities and features of autism spectrum disorders, which are characterized by impaired communication and socialization skills. Some researchers think that these microdeletions are different enough from KBG syndrome to be considered a separate disorder, called 16q24.3 microdeletion syndrome. "
ANO5 ,anoctamin 5,"The ANO5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called anoctamin-5. While the specific function of this protein is not well understood, it belongs to a family of proteins, called anoctamins, that act as chloride channels. Chloride channels, which transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions) in and out of cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. Studies suggest that most anoctamin proteins function as chloride channels that are turned on (activated) in the presence of positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions); these channels are known as calcium-activated chloride channels. The mechanism for this calcium activation is unclear. Anoctamin proteins are also involved in maintaining the membrane that surrounds cells and repairing the membrane if it gets damaged.The anoctamin-5 protein is most abundant in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For the body to move normally, skeletal muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. The regulation of chloride flow within muscle cells plays a role in controlling muscle contraction and relaxation.The anoctamin-5 protein is also found in other cells including heart (cardiac) muscle cells and bone cells. Studies have suggested that the anoctamin-5 protein may be important for the development of muscle and bone before birth.","Gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia At least three ANO5 gene mutations have been identified in people with a bone disorder called gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia, which leads to fragile bones, jaw problems, and other skeletal abnormalities. The ANO5 gene mutations that cause gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the anoctamin-5 protein. It is unclear how these mutations lead to the signs and symptoms of gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia, or why they primarily affect bones while other ANO5 gene mutations cause muscle disorders. Researchers suggest that the mutations may affect the way cells process calcium, an important mineral in bone development and growth. "
ANOS1 ,anosmin 1,"The ANOS1 gene, also known as KAL1, provides instructions for making a protein called anosmin-1. This protein is involved in development before birth. Anosmin-1 is found in the extracellular matrix, which is the intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. Anosmin-1 is active in many parts of the developing embryo, including the respiratory tract, kidneys, digestive system, and certain regions of the brain.Researchers are working to determine the functions of anosmin-1. They have discovered that, in the developing brain, this protein is involved in the movement (migration) of nerve cells and the outgrowth of axons, which are specialized extensions of nerve cells that transmit nerve impulses. The protein also plays a role in regulating contact between nerve cells (cell adhesion).Anosmin-1 appears to help control the growth and migration of a group of nerve cells that are specialized to process the sense of smell (olfactory neurons). These nerve cells originate in the developing nose and then migrate together to a structure in the front of the brain called the olfactory bulb, which is critical for the perception of odors. Studies suggest that anosmin-1 is also involved in the migration of neurons that produce a hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Like olfactory neurons, GnRH-producing neurons migrate from the developing nose to the front of the brain. GnRH controls the production of several hormones that direct sexual development before birth and during puberty. These hormones are important for the normal function of the ovaries in women and testes in men.","Kallmann syndrome More than 140 mutations in the ANOS1 gene have been identified in people with Kallmann syndrome, a disorder characterized by the combination of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (a condition affecting the production of hormones that direct sexual development) and an impaired sense of smell. This condition can also affect other body systems, and its features vary among affected individuals. Researchers estimate that mutations in the ANOS1 gene account for 5 to 10 percent of all cases of Kallmann syndrome.The ANOS1 gene mutations that cause Kallmann syndrome delete part or all of the gene, change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in anosmin-1, or alter the size of the protein. All of these mutations disrupt the normal production or function of anosmin-1 during embryonic development. Researchers suspect that the missing or altered protein is unable to direct the migration of olfactory nerve cells and GnRH-producing nerve cells to their usual locations in the developing brain. If olfactory nerve cells do not extend to the olfactory bulb, a person's sense of smell will be impaired. Misplacement of GnRH-producing neurons prevents the production of sex hormones, which interferes with normal sexual development and causes puberty to be delayed or absent.It is unclear how ANOS1 gene mutations lead to other possible signs and symptoms of Kallmann syndrome, including a failure of one kidney to develop (unilateral renal agenesis), hearing loss, and mirror movements of the hands (bimanual synkinesia). Because these features vary among individuals, researchers suspect that other genetic and environmental factors may be involved. Some affected individuals have mutations in one of several other genes in addition to ANOS1, and these genetic changes may contribute to the varied features of the condition. "
ANTXR2 ,ANTXR cell adhesion molecule 2,"The ANTXR2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found at the surface of many types of cells. The ANTXR2 protein is believed to interact with components of the extracellular matrix, which is the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell. This matrix strengthens and supports connective tissues, such as skin, bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments.The ANTXR2 protein is involved in the formation of tiny blood vessels (capillaries). It may also be important for maintaining the structure of basement membranes, which are thin, sheet-like extracellular matrix structures that separate and support cells in many connective tissues. Research suggests that the ANTXR2 protein aids in the breakdown of at least one type of extracellular matrix protein, ensuring the correct balance of proteins is maintained for normal functioning of muscles and connective tissues.The ANTXR2 protein also acts as a receptor for the toxin that causes anthrax, allowing the toxin to attach to cells and trigger disease.","Hyaline fibromatosis syndrome More than 45 mutations in the ANTXR2 gene have been found to cause hyaline fibromatosis syndrome, a painful condition characterized by accumulation of a clear (hyaline) substance in different tissues in the body. The nature of the hyaline substance is unknown, but it likely contains extracellular matrix proteins, among other materials. Buildup of this material can cause firm lumps of noncancerous tissue (nodules) under the skin and in internal organs, joint deformities called contractures that restrict movement, and overgrowth of the gums. The severity of the signs and symptoms falls along a spectrum. The most severely affected individuals have severe diarrhea and recurrent infections and usually do not survive beyond early childhood. Individuals at the milder end of the spectrum typically survive into adulthood.Some ANTXR2 gene mutations reduce or eliminate the amount of ANTXR2 protein at the surface of cells. Others are thought to impair the protein's ability to interact with extracellular matrix components. It is unclear what effect these mutations have in cells and tissues. Researchers suspect that gene mutations disrupt the formation of basement membranes, allowing a hyaline substance to leak through and build up in various body tissues. Alternatively, the mutations could impair the breakdown of excess extracellular matrix proteins, which then accumulate in tissues and lead to the signs and symptoms of hyaline fibromatosis syndrome.It is unclear why the severity of hyaline fibromatosis syndrome varies among affected individuals. Some studies have indicated that the severity of the condition may be linked to where in the gene the mutation occurs. "
APC ,"APC, WNT signaling pathway regulator","The APC gene provides instructions for making the APC protein, which plays a critical role in several cellular processes. The APC protein acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it keeps cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way. It helps control how often a cell divides, how it attaches to other cells within a tissue, and whether a cell moves within or away from a tissue. This protein also helps ensure that the number of chromosomes in a cell is correct following cell division. The APC protein accomplishes these tasks mainly through association with other proteins, especially those that are involved in cell attachment and signaling.One protein with which APC associates is beta-catenin. Beta-catenin helps control the activity (expression) of particular genes and promotes the growth and division (proliferation) of cells and the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation). Beta-catenin also helps cells attach to one another and is important for tissue formation. Association of APC with beta-catenin signals for beta-catenin to be broken down when it is no longer needed.","Desmoid tumor Several mutations in the APC gene have been found in people with a type of aggressive but noncancerous (benign) growth called a desmoid tumor. These rare tumors arise from connective tissue, which provides strength and flexibility to structures such as bones, ligaments, and muscles. APC gene mutations typically cause formation of desmoid tumors in the abdomen, but these tumors can also occur in other parts of the body. Although APC-related desmoid tumors are commonly associated with a form of colon cancer called familial adenomatous polyposis (described below), APC gene mutations can cause tumors in individuals without this inherited disease. APC gene mutations are found in about 10 to 15 percent of non-inherited (sporadic) desmoid tumors; these mutations are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in tumor cells.Most APC gene mutations that cause sporadic desmoid tumors lead to an abnormally short APC protein. The shortened protein is unable to interact with the beta-catenin protein, which prevents the breakdown of beta-catenin when it is no longer needed. Excess beta-catenin promotes uncontrolled growth and division of cells, allowing the formation of desmoid tumors. "
APOA1 ,apolipoprotein A1,"The APOA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). ApoA-I is a component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). HDL is a molecule that transports cholesterol and certain fats called phospholipids through the bloodstream from the body's tissues to the liver. Once in the liver, cholesterol and phospholipids are redistributed to other tissues or removed from the body.ApoA-I attaches to cell membranes and promotes the movement of cholesterol and phospholipids from inside the cell to the outer surface. Once outside the cell, these substances combine with apoA-I to form HDL. ApoA-I also triggers a reaction called cholesterol esterification that converts cholesterol to a form that can be fully integrated into HDL and transported through the bloodstream.HDL is often referred to as ""good cholesterol"" because high levels of this substance reduce the chances of developing heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. The process of removing excess cholesterol from cells is extremely important for balancing cholesterol levels and maintaining cardiovascular health.","Familial HDL deficiency Mutations in the APOA1 gene cause familial HDL deficiency, an inherited condition characterized by low levels of HDL in the blood and an elevated risk for early-onset cardiovascular disease, which often occurs before age 50. These mutations lead to an altered apoA-I protein. Some versions of the altered protein are less able to promote the removal of cholesterol and phospholipids from cells, which decreases the amount of these substances available to form HDL. Other versions of the altered protein are less able to stimulate cholesterol esterification, which means cholesterol cannot be integrated into HDL particles. Both types of mutation result in low HDL levels. A shortage (deficiency) of HDL is believed to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. "
APOB ,apolipoprotein B,"The APOB gene provides instructions for making two versions of the apolipoprotein B protein, a short version called apolipoprotein B-48 and a longer version known as apolipoprotein B-100. Both of these proteins are components of lipoproteins, which are particles that carry fats and fat-like substances (such as cholesterol) in the blood.Apolipoprotein B-48 is produced in the intestine, where it is a building block of a type of lipoprotein called a chylomicron. As food is digested after a meal, chylomicrons are formed to carry fat and cholesterol from the intestine into the bloodstream. Chylomicrons are also necessary for the absorption of certain fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin E and vitamin A.Apolipoprotein B-100, which is produced in the liver, is a component of several other types of lipoproteins. Specifically, this protein is a building block of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs), and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). These related molecules all transport fats and cholesterol in the bloodstream.LDLs are the primary carriers of cholesterol in the blood. Apolipoprotein B-100 allows LDLs to attach to specific receptors on the surface of cells, particularly in the liver. Once attached, the receptors transport LDLs into the cell, where they are broken down to release cholesterol. The cholesterol is then used by the cell, stored, or removed from the body.","Familial hypercholesterolemia More than 100 mutations in the APOB gene are known to cause familial hypercholesterolemia. This condition is characterized by very high levels of cholesterol in the blood and an increased risk of developing heart disease. Each mutation that causes this condition changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in a critical region of apolipoprotein B-100. (Apolipoprotein B-48 is normal.) The altered protein prevents LDLs from effectively attaching to their receptors on the surface of cells. As a result, fewer LDLs are removed from the blood, and blood cholesterol levels are much higher than normal. As the excess cholesterol circulates through the bloodstream, it is deposited abnormally in tissues such as the skin, tendons, and arteries that supply blood to the heart (coronary arteries). A buildup of cholesterol in the walls of coronary arteries greatly increases a person's risk of having a heart attack.Most people with familial hypercholesterolemia inherit one altered copy of the APOB gene from an affected parent and one normal copy of the gene from the other parent. These cases are associated with an increased risk of early heart disease, typically beginning in a person's forties or fifties. Rarely, a person with familial hypercholesterolemia is born with two mutated copies of the APOB gene. This situation occurs when the person has two affected parents, each of whom passes on one altered copy of the gene. The presence of two APOB gene mutations results in a more severe form of hypercholesterolemia that usually appears in childhood. "
APOE ,apolipoprotein E,"The APOE gene provides instructions for making a protein called apolipoprotein E. This protein combines with fats (lipids) in the body to form molecules called lipoproteins. Lipoproteins are responsible for packaging cholesterol and other fats and carrying them through the bloodstream. Maintaining normal levels of cholesterol is essential for the prevention of disorders that affect the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular diseases), including heart attack and stroke.There are at least three slightly different versions (alleles) of the APOE gene. The major alleles are called e2, e3, and e4. The most common allele is e3, which is found in more than half of the general population.","Alzheimer disease The e4 version of the APOE gene increases an individual's risk for developing late-onset Alzheimer disease. Alzheimer disease is a degenerative disease of the brain that causes dementia, which is a gradual loss of memory, judgment, and ability to function. The late-onset form of the condition occurs in people older than age 65. People who inherit one copy of the APOE e4 allele have an increased chance of developing the disease; those who inherit two copies of the allele are at even greater risk. The APOE e4 allele may also be associated with an earlier onset of memory loss and other symptoms compared to individuals with Alzheimer disease who do not have this allele.It is not known how the APOE e4 allele is related to the risk of Alzheimer disease. However, researchers have found that this allele is associated with an increased number of protein clumps, called amyloid plaques, in the brain tissue of affected people. A buildup of amyloid plaques may lead to the death of nerve cells (neurons) and the progressive signs and symptoms of this disorder.It is important to note that people with the APOE e4 allele inherit an increased risk of developing Alzheimer disease, not the disease itself. Not all people with Alzheimer disease have the APOE e4 allele, and not all people who have this allele will develop the disease. "
APP ,amyloid beta precursor protein,"The APP gene provides instructions for making a protein called amyloid precursor protein. This protein is found in many tissues and organs, including the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). Little is known about the function of amyloid precursor protein. Researchers speculate that it may bind to other proteins on the surface of cells or help cells attach to one another. Studies suggest that in the brain, it helps direct the movement (migration) of nerve cells (neurons) during early development.Amyloid precursor protein is cut by enzymes to create smaller fragments (peptides), some of which are released outside the cell. Two of these fragments are called soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) and amyloid beta (β) peptide. Recent evidence suggests that sAPP has growth-promoting properties and may play a role in the formation of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain both before and after birth. The sAPP peptide may also control the function of certain other proteins by turning off (inhibiting) their activity. Amyloid β peptide is likely involved in the ability of neurons to change and adapt over time (plasticity). Other functions of sAPP and amyloid β peptide are under investigation.","Alzheimer disease More than 50 different mutations in the APP gene can cause early-onset Alzheimer disease, which begins before age 65. These mutations are responsible for less than 10 percent of all early-onset cases of the disorder.The most common APP mutation changes one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) in the amyloid precursor protein. This mutation replaces the amino acid valine with the amino acid isoleucine at protein position 717 (written as Val717Ile or V717I). Mutations in the APP gene can lead to an increased amount of the amyloid β peptide or to the production of a slightly longer and stickier form of the peptide. When these protein fragments are released from the cell, they can accumulate in the brain and form clumps called amyloid plaques. These plaques are characteristic of Alzheimer disease. A buildup of toxic amyloid β peptide and amyloid plaques may lead to the death of neurons and the progressive signs and symptoms of this disorder. "
APRT ,adenine phosphoribosyltransferase,"The APRT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT). This enzyme is produced in all cells and is part of the purine salvage pathway, which recycles a group of DNA building blocks (nucleotides) called purines to make other molecules. The APRT enzyme helps to recycle the purine adenine to make a molecule called adenosine monophosphate (AMP). This conversion occurs when AMP is needed as a source of energy for cells.","Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency At least 40 mutations in the APRT gene have been found to cause adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficiency, a condition that affects the kidneys and urinary tract. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the APRT enzyme. The mutations that cause APRT deficiency are categorized into two groups known as the APRT*J allele and the APRT*Q0 allele. The APRT*J allele consists of one mutation that replaces the amino acid methionine with the amino acid threonine at position 136 in the APRT enzyme (written as Met136Thr or M136T). This mutation reduces the function of the enzyme. The M136T mutation occurs almost exclusively in Japanese individuals with the condition; most affected individuals have this mutation on both copies of the APRT gene in each cell. The APRT*Q0 allele consists of all other APRT gene mutations. The most common of these mutations (written IVS4+2insT) alters the genetic instructions used to make the enzyme, resulting in an abnormally short, nonfunctional enzyme. This mutation is estimated to occur in 40 percent of affected Europeans.APRT gene mutations lead to a lack of functional enzyme that prevents the conversion of adenine to AMP. As a result, adenine is converted to another molecule called 2,8-dihydroxyadenine (2,8-DHA). 2,8-DHA crystallizes in urine, forming stones in the kidneys and urinary tract. As a result, kidney function can decline, which may lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a life-threatening failure of kidney function. "
APTX ,aprataxin,"The APTX gene provides instructions for making a protein called aprataxin that is involved in the repair of DNA damage in cells. Aprataxin is located in the nucleus of cells and is produced in various tissues, including the brain, spinal cord, and muscles. Different parts of the aprataxin protein allow the protein to interact with other DNA repair proteins to make repairs. At the site of the damage, aprataxin modifies the broken ends of the DNA strands so they can be joined back together correctly.","Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia More than 30 mutations in the APTX gene have been found to cause ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1. This condition is characterized by difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia) and problems with side-to-side movements of the eyes (oculomotor apraxia). Most mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in aprataxin, resulting in an unstable aprataxin protein that is quickly broken down in the cell. A lack of functional aprataxin disrupts DNA repair and can lead to an accumulation of damage in cells, particularly affecting cells in the part of the brain involved in coordinating movements (the cerebellum). This accumulation can lead to cell death in the cerebellum, causing the characteristic movement problems of ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1. "
AQP2 ,aquaporin 2,"The AQP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called aquaporin 2. This protein forms a channel that carries water molecules across cell membranes. It is found in the kidneys in structures called collecting ducts, which are a series of small tubes that reabsorb water from the kidneys into the bloodstream.The aquaporin 2 water channel plays an essential role in maintaining the body's water balance. The placement of these channels is controlled by a hormone called vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone (ADH). When a person's fluid intake is low or when a lot of fluid is lost (for example, through sweating), the body produces more ADH. This hormone triggers chemical reactions that ultimately insert aquaporin 2 water channels into the membrane of collecting duct cells. These channels allow water to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream, which makes the urine more concentrated. When fluid intake is adequate, less ADH is produced. Without signals from ADH, aquaporin 2 water channels are removed from the membrane of collecting duct cells. At these times, less water is reabsorbed into the bloodstream and the urine is more dilute.","Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus At least 40 mutations in the AQP2 gene have been identified in people with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.Most of the known AQP2 gene mutations cause the aquaporin 2 protein to be misfolded into an incorrect 3-dimensional shape. The misfolded protein is trapped within the cell, where it is unable to reach the cell membrane to transport water molecules. A few mutations result in the production of functional aquaporin 2 water channels, but these channels are misrouted within the cell and do not reach the cell membrane.If aquaporin 2 water channels are not inserted into the membrane of collecting duct cells, the kidneys are unable to respond to signals from ADH. As a result, collecting ducts do not reabsorb water as they should, and the body makes excessive amounts of urine. These problems with water balance are characteristic of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. "
AR ,androgen receptor,"The AR gene provides instructions for making a protein called an androgen receptor. Androgens are hormones (such as testosterone) that are important for normal male sexual development before birth and during puberty. Androgen receptors allow the body to respond appropriately to these hormones. The receptors are present in many of the body's tissues, where they attach (bind) to androgens. The resulting androgen-receptor complex then binds to DNA and regulates the activity of androgen-responsive genes. By turning the genes on or off as necessary, the androgen receptor helps direct the development of male sexual characteristics. Androgens and androgen receptors also have other important functions in both males and females, such as regulating hair growth and sex drive.In one region of the AR gene, a DNA segment known as CAG is repeated multiple times. This CAG segment is called a triplet or trinucleotide repeat. In most people, the number of CAG repeats in the AR gene ranges from fewer than 10 to about 36.","Androgen insensitivity syndrome More than 600 different mutations in the AR gene have been identified in people with androgen insensitivity syndrome, a condition that affects sexual development before birth and during puberty. Most of these mutations are changes in single DNA building blocks (base pairs). Other mutations insert or delete multiple base pairs in the gene or affect how the gene is processed into a protein. Some mutations lead to an abnormally short version of the androgen receptor protein, while others result in the production of an abnormal receptor that cannot bind to androgens or to DNA. As a result, cells that are sensitive to androgens become less responsive to these hormones or unable to use these hormones at all. People with this condition are genetically male, with one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each cell. Because their bodies are unable to respond to androgens, they may have mostly female sex characteristics or signs of both male and female sexual development.Mutations that completely eliminate the function of the androgen receptor cause complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. Genetic changes that significantly reduce but do not eliminate the receptor's activity cause partial androgen insensitivity syndrome. Mild androgen insensitivity syndrome results from changes that only slightly reduce the activity of the receptor. "
ARFGEF2 ,ADP ribosylation factor guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2,"The ARFGEF2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps with the movement (trafficking) of small sac-like structures (vesicles) within the cell. The ARFGEF2 protein converts a molecule called guanine diphosphate (GDP) to another molecule called guanine triphosphate (GTP). This reaction activates an ADP-ribosylation factor, a molecule that is involved in vesicle trafficking. Vesicles transport many types of molecules from the interior of the cell to its surface, where they may attach and interact with other substances, or be secreted by the cell.","Periventricular heterotopia A few mutations in the ARFGEF2 gene have been identified in individuals with periventricular heterotopia. These mutations may interfere with vesicle trafficking, which is important in controlling cell migration during the development of the brain. Nerve cells (neurons) that do not migrate properly during development form clumps around fluid-filled cavities (ventricles) near the center of the brain, resulting in the signs and symptoms of periventricular heterotopia.Mutations in the ARFGEF2 gene may also result in weakening of the attachments (adhesion) between cells that form the lining of the ventricles, by impairing the trafficking of the molecules needed for this adhesion. A weakened ventricular lining could allow some neurons to form clumps around the ventricles while others migrate normally to the exterior of the brain, as seen in periventricular heterotopia. "
ARG1 ,arginase 1,"The ARG1 gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme arginase. This enzyme participates in the urea cycle, a series of reactions that occurs in liver cells. The urea cycle processes excess nitrogen, which is generated when proteins and their building blocks (amino acids) are used by the body. Through the urea cycle, excess nitrogen is made into a compound called urea that is excreted by the kidneys. Excreting the excess nitrogen prevents it from accumulating in the form of ammonia, which is toxic.Arginase controls the last step of the urea cycle, a reaction in which nitrogen is removed from the amino acid arginine and processed into urea for excretion from the body. A compound called ornithine is also produced in this reaction; it is needed for the urea cycle to repeat.","Arginase deficiency Approximately 12 mutations have been identified in the ARG1 gene. A mutated ARG1 gene may result in an arginase enzyme that is unstable, shorter than usual or the wrong shape, or may prevent the enzyme from being produced at all.The shape of an enzyme affects its ability to control a chemical reaction. If the arginase enzyme is misshapen or missing, it cannot fulfill its role in the urea cycle. Excess nitrogen is not converted to urea for excretion, and ammonia and arginine accumulate in the body. Ammonia is toxic, especially to the nervous system, and the accumulation of ammonia and arginine are believed to cause the neurological problems and other signs and symptoms of arginase deficiency. "
ARHGAP31 ,Rho GTPase activating protein 31,"The ARHGAP31 gene provides instructions for making a protein classified as a Rho GTPase activating protein (GAP). GAPs turn off (inactivate) proteins called GTPases, which play an important role in chemical signaling within cells. Often referred to as molecular switches, GTPases can be turned on and off. They are turned on (active) when they are attached (bound) to a molecule called GTP and are turned off when they are bound to another molecule called GDP. The ARHGAP31 protein inactivates GTPases known as Cdc42 and Rac1 by stimulating a reaction that turns the attached GTP into GDP. When active, Cdc42 and Rac1 transmit signals that are critical for various aspects of embryonic development. The ARHGAP31 protein appears to regulate these GTPases specifically during development of the limbs, skull, and heart.","Adams-Oliver syndrome At least three mutations in the ARHGAP31 gene are known to cause Adams-Oliver syndrome, a condition characterized by areas of missing skin (aplasia cutis congenita), usually on the scalp, and malformations of the hands and feet. These mutations lead to production of an abnormally short ARHGAP31 protein that is more active than normal. The increased GAP activity leads to a reduction in Cdc42 and Rac1 signaling, which impairs proper development of the skin on the top of the head and the bones in the hands and feet. "
ARID1A ,AT-rich interaction domain 1A,"The ARID1A gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms one piece (subunit) of several different SWI/SNF protein complexes. SWI/SNF complexes regulate gene activity (expression) by a process known as chromatin remodeling. Chromatin is the network of DNA and protein that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. Chromatin remodeling is one way gene expression is regulated during development; when DNA is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when DNA is loosely packed.Through their ability to regulate gene activity, SWI/SNF complexes are involved in many processes, including repairing damaged DNA; copying (replicating) DNA; and controlling the growth, division, and maturation (differentiation) of cells. The ARID1A protein and other SWI/SNF subunits are thought to act as tumor suppressors, which keep cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.The ARID1A subunit is able to attach (bind) to DNA and is thought to help target SWI/SNF complexes to the chromatin location that needs to be remodeled.","Coffin-Siris syndrome At least three mutations in the ARID1A gene can cause Coffin-Siris syndrome. This condition is characterized by delayed development, abnormalities of the fifth (pinky) fingers or toes, and characteristic facial features that are described as coarse. The ARID1A gene mutations involved in Coffin-Siris syndrome lead to an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein. As a result, affected individuals have half the normal amount of functioning ARID1A protein. Although it is unclear how these changes affect SWI/SNF complexes, researchers suggest that ARID1A gene mutations result in abnormal chromatin remodeling. Disturbance of this process alters the activity of many genes and disrupts several cellular processes, which could explain the diverse signs and symptoms of Coffin-Siris syndrome. People with Coffin-Siris syndrome do not appear to have an increased risk of cancer (see below). "
ARID1B ,AT-rich interaction domain 1B,"The ARID1B gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms one piece (subunit) of several different SWI/SNF protein complexes. SWI/SNF complexes regulate gene activity (expression) by a process known as chromatin remodeling. Chromatin is the network of DNA and proteins that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. Chromatin remodeling is one way gene expression is regulated during development; when DNA is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when DNA is loosely packed.Through their ability to regulate gene activity, SWI/SNF complexes are involved in many processes, including repairing damaged DNA; copying (replicating) DNA; and controlling the growth, division, and maturation (differentiation) of cells. The ARID1B protein and other SWI/SNF subunits are thought to act as tumor suppressors, which keep cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.The ARID1B subunit is able to attach (bind) to DNA and is thought to help target SWI/SNF complexes to the chromatin location that needs to be remodeled.","Coffin-Siris syndrome At least 69 mutations in the ARID1B gene have been found to cause Coffin-Siris syndrome. This condition is characterized by delayed development, abnormalities of the fifth (pinky) fingers or toes, and characteristic facial features that are described as coarse. Most ARID1B gene mutations involved in Coffin-Siris syndrome lead to an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein. As a result, affected individuals have half the normal amount of functional ARID1B protein. Although it is unclear how these changes affect SWI/SNF complexes, researchers suggest that ARID1B gene mutations result in abnormal chromatin remodeling. Disturbance of this process alters the activity of many genes and disrupts several cellular processes, which could explain the diverse signs and symptoms of Coffin-Siris syndrome. People with Coffin-Siris syndrome do not appear to have an increased risk of cancer (see below). "
ARMC5 ,armadillo repeat containing 5,"The ARMC5 gene provides instructions for making a protein about which little is known. It is found mainly in the fluid surrounding the cell nucleus (cytoplasm), and studies suggest that its function depends on interacting with other proteins. It is thought to act as a tumor suppressor, which means that it helps to prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.","Primary macronodular adrenal hyperplasia At least 24 mutations in the ARMC5 gene have been identified in people with primary macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (PMAH), a disorder that causes multiple lumps (nodules) to form in the adrenal glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. These nodules cause adrenal gland enlargement (hyperplasia) and result in production of higher-than-normal levels of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol normally helps maintain blood sugar levels, protects the body from physical stress, and suppresses inflammation. Increased cortisol levels can lead to weight gain in the face and upper body, fragile skin, bone loss, fatigue, and other health problems, which often occur in people with PMAH.People with PMAH caused by ARMC5 gene mutations inherit one copy of the mutated gene in each cell. However, the condition develops only when affected individuals acquire a second mutation in the other copy of the ARMC5 gene in certain cells of the adrenal glands. This second mutation is described as somatic. Instead of being passed from parent to child, somatic mutations are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. Because somatic mutations are also required for PMAH to occur, some people who have inherited the altered ARMC5 gene never develop the condition, a situation known as reduced penetrance.The ARMC5 gene mutations that cause PMAH are thought to impair the protein's tumor suppressor function, which allows the overgrowth of certain cells. It is unclear why this overgrowth is limited to the adrenal glands in people with PMAH. "
ARMS2 ,age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2,"The ARMS2 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. Studies suggest that the ARMS2 protein is found primarily in the placenta and in the specialized light-sensing tissue in the back of the eye (the retina). However, it is unclear what role, if any, the protein plays in early development or normal vision.","Age-related macular degeneration The ARMS2 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 10 in a region known as 10q26. This region has been strongly associated with the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration, a common cause of vision loss in older adults. Researchers have identified several variations (polymorphisms) in and near the ARMS2 gene that may explain the association between the 10q26 region and age-related macular degeneration. The best-studied of these variations, known as rs10490924, alters a single protein building block (amino acid) in the ARMS2 protein. Another common variation, a complex change that deletes a segment of the ARMS2 gene and inserts new genetic material, may also contribute to disease risk.It is unclear how polymorphisms in the ARMS2 gene might be related to age-related macular degeneration. In the 10q26 region, the ARMS2 gene is located next to a gene called HTRA1; changes in this gene have also been studied as a risk factor for the disease. Because the two genes are so close together, it is difficult to tell whether changes in one gene or the other, or possibly changes in both genes, account for the increased disease risk. Age-related macular degeneration is a complex condition that likely results from a combination of multiple genetic and environmental factors. "
ARSA ,arylsulfatase A,"The ARSA gene provides instructions for making the enzyme arylsulfatase A. This enzyme is located in cellular structures called lysosomes, which are the cell's recycling centers. Within lysosomes, arylsulfatase A helps process substances known as sulfatides. Sulfatides are a subgroup of sphingolipids, a category of fats that are important components of cell membranes. Sulfatides are abundant in the nervous system's white matter, consisting of nerve fibers covered by myelin. Myelin, made up of multiple layers of membranes, insulates and protects nerves.","Metachromatic leukodystrophy More than 110 mutations that cause metachromatic leukodystrophy, a disorder that causes deterioration of nervous system functions, have been identified in the ARSA gene. These mutations greatly reduce the activity of arylsulfatase A. Severe disruption in arylsulfatase A activity interferes with the breakdown of sulfatides. As a result, these substances can accumulate to toxic levels in the nervous system. The buildup of sulfatides gradually destroys the cells that produce myelin, the covering that protects nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. Destruction of myelin leads to the loss of white matter (leukodystrophy) and impairment of nervous system function, resulting in the signs and symptoms of metachromatic leukodystrophy.In some cases, individuals with very low arylsulfatase A activity show no signs or symptoms of metachromatic leukodystrophy. This condition, called pseudoarylsulfatase deficiency, seems to be caused by specific variations of the ARSA gene. These variations are present in as many as 5 to 10 percent of Europeans and North Americans. "
ARSB ,arylsulfatase B,"The ARSB gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called arylsulfatase B, which is involved in the breakdown of large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Specifically, arylsulfatase B removes a chemical group known as a sulfate from two GAGs called dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. Arylsulfatase B is located in lysosomes, compartments within cells that digest and recycle different types of molecules.","Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI More than 130 mutations in the ARSB gene have been found to cause mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI). Most of these mutations change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the gene. All of the mutations that cause MPS VI reduce or eliminate the function of arylsulfatase B. It usually cannot be determined whether a certain mutation will cause severe or mild MPS VI; however, mutations known to result in the complete absence of arylsulfatase B activity cause severe signs and symptoms.The lack of arylsulfatase B activity leads to the accumulation of GAGs within lysosomes. Conditions such as MPS VI that cause molecules to build up inside the lysosomes are called lysosomal storage disorders. The accumulation of GAGs within lysosomes increases the size of cells, which is why many tissues and organs are enlarged in this disorder. Researchers believe that the buildup of GAGs may also interfere with the functions of other proteins inside lysosomes, triggering inflammation and cell death. "
ARSL ,arylsulfatase E,"The ARSL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called arylsulfatase E. This enzyme is part of a group known as sulfatases, which are enzymes that help process molecules that contain chemical groups known as sulfates. Sulfatases play important roles in cartilage and bone development.Within cells, arylsulfatase E is located in the Golgi apparatus, a structure that modifies newly produced enzymes and other proteins. The function of this enzyme is unknown, although researchers believe it participates in a chemical pathway involving vitamin K. Evidence suggests that vitamin K normally plays a role in bone growth and maintenance of bone density.","X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 1 Genetic changes involving the ARSL gene are responsible for X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 1, a disorder of bone and cartilage development that occurs almost exclusively in males. Between 60 and 75 percent of males with the characteristic features of this condition have a mutation within the ARSL gene. At least 18 mutations have been found in affected individuals; these genetic changes reduce or eliminate the function of arylsulfatase E. Another 25 percent of affected males have a small deletion of genetic material from the region of the X chromosome that contains the ARSL gene. These individuals are missing the entire gene, so their cells produce no functional arylsulfatase E.It is unclear how a shortage of arylsulfatase E disrupts the development of bones and cartilage and leads to the characteristic features of X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 1. "
ARX ,aristaless related homeobox,"The ARX gene provides instructions for producing a protein that regulates the activity of other genes. On the basis of this action, the ARX protein is called a transcription factor. The ARX gene is part of a larger family of homeobox genes, which act during early embryonic development to control the formation of many body structures. Specifically, the ARX protein is believed to be involved in the development of the brain, pancreas, testes, and muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles).In the pancreas, testes, and skeletal muscles, the ARX protein helps to regulate the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation). Within the developing brain, the ARX protein is involved with movement (migration) and communication of nerve cells (neurons). In particular, this protein regulates genes that play a role in the migration of specialized neurons (interneurons) to their proper location. Interneurons relay signals between other neurons.","Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 1 Mutations in the ARX gene can cause early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 1 (EIEE1), a disorder characterized by recurrent seizures called infantile spasms that begin in the first year of life. Children with this condition also have intellectual disability.The normal ARX protein contains four regions where a protein building block (amino acid) called alanine is repeated multiple times. These stretches of alanines are known as polyalanine tracts. The most common ARX gene mutations that cause EIEE1 add extra alanines to the first or second polyalanine tract in the ARX protein. This type of mutation is called a polyalanine repeat expansion. Research suggests that these polyalanine repeat expansions reduce the amount of ARX protein in cells, although the mechanism is unclear. Other ARX gene mutations that cause this condition are believed to reduce the function of the ARX protein. A shortage of ARX function is thought to impair the normal development and migration of certain interneurons, which likely underlies infantile spasms and other neurological problems characteristic of EIEE1. "
ASAH1 ,N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 1,"The ASAH1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called acid ceramidase. This enzyme is found in lysosomes, which are cell compartments that digest and recycle materials. Within lysosomes, acid ceramidase breaks down fats called ceramides. Ceramides are typically found within the membranes that surround cells and play a role in regulating cell maturation (differentiation), growth and division of cells (proliferation), and controlled cell death (apoptosis). Additionally, ceramides are a component of a fatty substance called myelin that insulates and protects nerve cells. When ceramides need to be replaced, they travel to lysosomes where acid ceramidase breaks them down into a fat called sphingosine and a fatty acid. These two breakdown products are recycled to create new ceramides for the body to use.","Farber lipogranulomatosis At least 20 mutations in the ASAH1 gene have been found to cause Farber lipogranulomatosis. This condition is characterized by the buildup of fats (lipids) in cells throughout the body, particularly around the joints. Most of the mutations associated with Farber lipogranulomatosis change a single protein building block (amino acid) in acid ceramidase, which severely reduces the activity of the enzyme, typically to less than one-tenth of normal. As a result, the enzyme cannot break down ceramides properly and they build up in the lysosomes of various cells, including in the lungs, liver, muscles, brain, cartilage, and bone. It is unclear how an accumulation of ceramides impairs the normal functioning of cells, but these damaged cells lead to the voice, skin, and joint problems that are characteristic of Farber lipogranulomatosis. Ceramides influence various cell functions, and it is likely that abnormal regulation of these processes also contributes to the features of this condition. "
ASH1L ,ASH1 like histone lysine methyltransferase,"The ASH1L gene, also known as KMT2H, provides instructions for making an enzyme, called lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H, that is found in many organs and tissues of the body. Lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H functions as a histone methyltransferase. Histone methyltransferases are enzymes that modify proteins called histones. Histones are structural proteins that attach (bind) to DNA and give chromosomes their shape. By adding a molecule called a methyl group to histones (a process called methylation), histone methyltransferases control (regulate) the activity of certain genes. Lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H appears to turn on (activate) certain genes that are especially important for development of the brain.","Autism spectrum disorder At least seven ASH1L gene mutations have been identified in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a varied condition characterized by impaired social skills, communication problems, and repetitive behaviors. Some ASH1L gene mutations associated with ASD change one building block (amino acid) in the lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H enzyme. Others delete genetic material in the ASH1L gene sequence or result in a premature stop signal that leads to an abnormally short enzyme. As a result of these mutations, the enzyme is nonfunctional. A lack of functional lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H enzyme disrupts histone methylation. The resulting changes in the expression of genes regulated by lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H affect brain development and increase the risk of ASD. Normal variations in other genes, as well as environmental risk factors, such as parental age, birth complications, and others that have not been identified, also affect an individual's risk of developing this complex condition. "
ASL ,argininosuccinate lyase,"The ASL gene provides instructions for making the protein argininosuccinate lyase. This enzyme participates in the urea cycle, a series of reactions that occur in liver cells. The urea cycle processes excess nitrogen, generated when protein is used by the body, to make a compound called urea that is excreted by the kidneys. Excreting the excess nitrogen prevents it from accumulating in the form of ammonia.The specific role of the ASL enzyme is to start the reaction in which the amino acid arginine, a building block of proteins, is produced from argininosuccinate, the molecule that carries the waste nitrogen collected earlier in the urea cycle. The arginine is later broken down into urea, which is excreted, and ornithine, which restarts the urea cycle.","Argininosuccinic aciduria More than 30 different mutations in the ASL gene have been identified worldwide. In some cases, a short sequence of DNA is deleted from the gene. Other mutations replace one protein building block (amino acid) with another amino acid in the argininosuccinate lyase enzyme. In people of Arab descent, two common mutations replace the amino acid glutamine with a premature stop signal at position 116 (written as Gln116Ter or Q116X) or position 354 (written as Gln354Ter or Q354X) in the argininosuccinate lyase enzyme. Mutations in the ASL gene may result in an argininosuccinate lyase enzyme that is unstable or the wrong shape.The shape of an enzyme affects its ability to control a chemical reaction. If the argininosuccinate lyase enzyme is misshapen or missing, it cannot fulfill its role in the urea cycle. Excess nitrogen is not converted to urea for excretion, and ammonia accumulates in the body. Ammonia is toxic, especially to the nervous system, so this accumulation causes neurological problems and other signs and symptoms of argininosuccinic aciduria. "
ASNS ,asparagine synthetase (glutamine-hydrolyzing),"The ASNS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called asparagine synthetase. This enzyme is found in cells throughout the body, where it converts the protein building block (amino acid) aspartic acid to the amino acid asparagine. Another amino acid called glutamine helps in the conversion and is itself converted to the amino acid glutamic acid during the process. It is thought that asparagine synthetase helps to maintain the normal balance of these four amino acids in the body.Asparagine is needed to produce many proteins but also plays other roles. Asparagine helps to break down toxic ammonia within cells, is important for protein modification, and is needed for making a certain molecule that transmits signals in the brain (a neurotransmitter).Although asparagine can be obtained through the diet, the amino acid cannot cross the protective barrier that allows only certain substances to pass between blood vessels and the brain (the blood-brain barrier). As a result, brain cells rely solely on asparagine synthetase to produce asparagine.","Asparagine synthetase deficiency At least 15 mutations in the ASNS gene have been found to cause asparagine synthetase deficiency, a severe condition that causes neurological problems soon after birth. In most cases, these mutations replace single amino acids in the enzyme. The altered enzymes have little or no function. Asparagine from the diet likely makes up for the enzyme's inability to produce the amino acid in cells. However, because asparagine cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, brain cells in people with asparagine synthetase deficiency have a shortage (deficiency) of this amino acid. The exact effect of asparagine synthetase deficiency on brain cells is unknown, but because of the severe features of this condition, it is clear that asparagine is necessary for normal brain development. A lack of asparagine in developing brain cells leads to poor brain development and the severe neurological problems in individuals with asparagine synthetase deficiency. It is unclear whether a lack of glutamic acid or a buildup of glutamine impacts the signs and symptoms of this condition. "
ASPA ,aspartoacylase,"The ASPA gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aspartoacylase. In the brain, this enzyme breaks down a compound called N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid (NAA) into aspartic acid (an amino acid that is a building block of many proteins) and another molecule called acetic acid.The production and breakdown of NAA appears to be critical for maintaining the brain's white matter, which consists of nerve fibers surrounded by a myelin sheath. The myelin sheath is the covering that protects nerve fibers and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. The precise function of NAA is unclear. Researchers had suspected that it played a role in the production of the myelin sheath, but recent studies suggest that NAA does not have this function. The enzyme may instead be involved in the transport of water molecules out of nerve cells (neurons).","Canavan disease More than 80 mutations in the ASPA gene are known to cause Canavan disease, which is a rare inherited disorder that affects brain development. Researchers have described two major forms of this condition: neonatal/infantile Canavan disease, which is the most common and most severe form, and mild/juvenile Canavan disease. The ASPA gene mutations that cause the neonatal/infantile form severely impair the activity of aspartoacylase, preventing the breakdown of NAA and allowing this substance to build up to high levels in the brain. The mutations that cause the mild/juvenile form have milder effects on the enzyme's activity, leading to less accumulation of NAA.An excess of NAA in the brain is associated with the signs and symptoms of Canavan disease. Studies suggest that if NAA is not broken down properly, the resulting chemical imbalance interferes with the formation of the myelin sheath as the nervous system develops. A buildup of NAA also leads to the progressive destruction of existing myelin sheaths. Nerves without this protective covering malfunction, which disrupts normal brain development.While Canavan disease occurs in people of all ethnic backgrounds, it is most common in people of Ashkenazi (eastern and central European) Jewish heritage. Two specific ASPA gene mutations cause almost all cases of the disease in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. One of these mutations replaces the amino acid glutamic acid with the amino acid alanine at position 285 of the enzyme (written as Glu285Ala or E285A). This genetic change greatly reduces the amount of functional aspartoacylase. The other mutation, which is written as Tyr231Ter or Y231X, prematurely stops protein production and leads to an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the enzyme.A different ASPA gene mutation is most common in people who are not of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. This mutation substitutes the amino acid glutamic acid for the amino acid alanine at position 305 of aspartoacylase (written as Ala305Glu or A305E). This mutation also leads to the production of a nonfunctional version of the enzyme. "
ASPM ,abnormal spindle microtubule assembly,"The ASPM gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in cell division. This protein is found in cells and tissues throughout the body; however, it appears to be particularly important for the division of cells in the developing brain. Studies suggest that the ASPM protein helps maintain the orderly division of early brain cells called neural progenitor cells, which ultimately give rise to mature nerve cells (neurons). By promoting the division of neural progenitor cells during early brain development, the ASPM protein helps determine the total number of neurons and the overall size of the brain.","Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly Mutations in the ASPM gene are the most common cause of autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (often shortened to MCPH, which stands for ""microcephaly primary hereditary""). This condition is characterized by an abnormally small head and brain, intellectual disability, and delayed development. More than 80 mutations in the ASPM gene have been found to cause MCPH.Almost all of the ASPM gene mutations responsible for MCPH reduce production of the ASPM protein. The protein that is produced is shorter than normal and is thought to be partly or wholly nonfunctional. A shortage of functional ASPM protein impairs cell division, especially in neural progenitor cells in the developing brain. As a result, fewer mature neurons are produced, and affected individuals are born with an unusually small brain. Small head size, intellectual disability, and delayed development are all consequences of the small brain size.Because the ASPM protein is found in cells throughout the body, it is unclear why ASPM gene mutations affect neural progenitor cells more severely than other cell types. Some researchers believe that neural progenitor cells are more sensitive than other types of cells to a shortage of the ASPM protein. Other researchers have suggested that another protein may be able to compensate for the loss of the ASPM protein in cells outside the brain. "
ASS1 ,argininosuccinate synthase 1,"The ASS1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called argininosuccinate synthase 1. This enzyme participates in the urea cycle, which is a sequence of chemical reactions that takes place in liver cells. The urea cycle processes excess nitrogen that is generated as the body breaks down proteins. The excess nitrogen is used to make a compound called urea, which is excreted from the body in urine.Argininosuccinate synthase 1 is involved in the third step of the urea cycle. This step combines two protein building blocks (amino acids), citrulline and aspartate, to form a molecule called argininosuccinic acid. A series of additional chemical reactions uses argininosuccinic acid to form urea.","Citrullinemia At least 118 mutations that cause type I citrullinemia have been identified in the ASS1 gene. Type I citrullinemia is a serious condition that usually appears in the first few days of life. It causes life-threatening health problems, including poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, and loss of consciousness. Most of the mutations involved in type I citrullinemia change single amino acids in the argininosuccinate synthase 1 enzyme. These genetic changes likely alter the structure of the enzyme, impairing its ability to attach to molecules such as citrulline and aspartate. A few mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the enzyme that cannot effectively play its role in the urea cycle.Defects in argininosuccinate synthase 1 disrupt the third step of the urea cycle, preventing the liver from processing excess nitrogen into urea. As a result, nitrogen (in the form of ammonia) and other byproducts of the urea cycle (such as citrulline) build up in the bloodstream. Ammonia is toxic, particularly to the nervous system. An accumulation of ammonia during the first few days of life leads to poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, and the other signs and symptoms of type I citrullinemia. "
ASXL1 ,ASXL transcriptional regulator 1,"The ASXL1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in a process known as chromatin remodeling. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and proteins that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. When DNA is tightly packed, gene activity (expression) is lower than when DNA is loosely packed.Through its role in chromatin remodeling, the ASXL1 protein regulates the expression of many genes, including a group of genes known as HOX genes, which play important roles in development before birth. The ASXL1 protein can turn on (activate) or turn off (repress) HOX genes depending on when they are needed.The ASXL1 protein may have an additional role in gene regulation by signaling to molecules to add a methyl group (a process called methylation) to an area near a gene called the promoter region, which controls gene activity. When a promoter region is methylated, gene activity is repressed, and when a promoter region is not methylated, the gene is active.","Bohring-Opitz syndrome More than 20 mutations in the ASXL1 gene have been found to cause Bohring-Opitz syndrome, a condition that causes abnormal head size and shape, distinctive facial features, joint abnormalities, intellectual disability, and other signs and symptoms. Most of the ASXL1 gene mutations that cause Bohring-Opitz syndrome create a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the ASXL1 protein, resulting in either an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein or a complete lack of ASXL1 protein. These ASXL1 gene mutations are described as ""loss-of-function"" because they reduce the amount of functional ASXL1 protein available, which likely disrupts the regulation of the activity of HOX genes and other genes during development. Altered activity of HOX genes probably leads to the neurological and physical features of this condition. "
ATG16L1 ,autophagy related 16 like 1,"The ATG16L1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is required for a process called autophagy. Cells use this process to recycle worn-out cell parts and break down certain proteins when they are no longer needed. Autophagy also plays an important role in controlled cell death (apoptosis). Additionally, autophagy is involved in the body's inflammatory response and helps the immune system destroy some types of harmful bacteria and viruses.","Crohn disease At least one variation in the ATG16L1 gene is associated with an increased risk of Crohn disease, particularly a form of the disorder that affects the lower part of the small intestine (the ileum) and the colon. This increased risk has been found primarily in people of northern European ancestry. The identified ATG16L1 variation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in a critical region of the ATG16L1 protein. Specifically, it replaces the amino acid threonine with the amino acid alanine at protein position 300 (written as Thr300Ala or T300A).This change in the ATG16L1 gene impairs the autophagy process, allowing worn-out cell parts and harmful bacteria to persist when they would otherwise be destroyed. These cell components and bacteria may trigger an inappropriate immune system response, leading to chronic inflammation in the intestinal walls and the digestive problems characteristic of Crohn disease. Researchers continue to study the relationship between changes in the ATG16L1 gene and a person's risk of developing this disorder. "
ATL1 ,atlastin GTPase 1,"The ATL1 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called atlastin-1. Atlastin-1 is produced primarily in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), particularly in nerve cells (neurons) that extend down the spinal cord (corticospinal tracts). These neurons send electrical signals that lead to voluntary muscle movement. In neurons, this protein is found mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is a structure involved in protein processing and distribution. Atlastin-1 fuses together the network of tubules that make up the structure of the endoplasmic reticulum. Atlastin-1 is also active in compartments called axonal growth cones, which are located at the tip of neurons. The axonal growth cones direct the growth of specialized extensions, called axons, which transmit nerve impulses that signal muscle movement. Within axonal growth cones, atlastin-1 acts during development to help guide the growth of axons.","Spastic paraplegia type 3A Approximately 60 mutations in the ATL1 gene have been found to cause spastic paraplegia type 3A. This condition is characterized by muscle stiffness (spasticity) and weakness of the lower limbs (paraplegia), which begin in childhood. Most of the mutations that cause spastic paraplegia type 3A change one protein building block (amino acid) in the atlastin-1 protein. These mutations likely lead to abnormal activity of atlastin-1, which impairs the functioning of neurons, including the distribution of materials within these cells. This lack of functional atlastin-1 protein can also restrict the growth of axons. Within the long neurons of the corticospinal tracts, these problems can lead to cell death. As a result, the neurons are unable to transmit nerve impulses, particularly to other neurons and muscles in the lower extremities. This impaired nerve function leads to the signs and symptoms of spastic paraplegia type 3A. "
ATM ,ATM serine/threonine kinase,"The ATM gene provides instructions for making a protein that is located primarily in the nucleus of cells, where it helps control the rate at which cells grow and divide. This protein also plays an important role in the normal development and activity of several body systems, including the nervous system and the immune system. Additionally, the ATM protein assists cells in recognizing damaged or broken DNA strands. DNA can be damaged by agents such as toxic chemicals or radiation. Breaks in DNA strands also occur naturally when chromosomes exchange genetic material during cell division. The ATM protein coordinates DNA repair by activating enzymes that fix the broken strands. Efficient repair of damaged DNA strands helps maintain the stability of the cell's genetic information.Because of its central role in cell division and DNA repair, the ATM protein is of great interest in cancer research.","Ataxia-telangiectasia Researchers have identified several hundred mutations in the ATM gene that cause ataxia-telangiectasia. People with this disorder have mutations in both copies of the ATM gene in each cell. Most of these mutations disrupt protein production, resulting in an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the ATM protein. Cells without any functional ATM protein are hypersensitive to radiation and do not respond normally to DNA damage. Instead of activating DNA repair, the defective ATM protein allows mutations to accumulate in other genes, which may cause cells to grow and divide in an uncontrolled way. This kind of unregulated cell growth can lead to the formation of cancerous tumors. In addition, ATM mutations can allow cells to die inappropriately, particularly affecting cells in a part of the brain involved in coordinating movements (the cerebellum). This loss of brain cells causes the movement problems characteristic of ataxia-telangiectasia. "
ATN1 ,atrophin 1,"The ATN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called atrophin 1. Although the exact function of this protein is unknown, it appears to play an important role in nerve cells (neurons) in many areas of the brain. Based on studies in other animals, researchers speculate that atrophin 1 may act as a transcriptional co-repressor. A transcriptional co-repressor is a protein that interacts with other DNA-binding proteins to suppress the activity of certain genes, although it cannot attach (bind) to DNA by itself.One region of the ATN1 gene contains a particular DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (cytosine, adenine, and guanine) that appear multiple times in a row. In most people, the number of CAG repeats in the ATN1 gene ranges from 6 to 35.","Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) results from an increased number of copies (expansion) of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the ATN1 gene. In people with this condition, the CAG segment is abnormally repeated at least 48 times, and the repeat region may be two or three times its usual length. Although the extended CAG region changes the structure of atrophin 1, it is unclear how the altered protein damages brain cells. Researchers believe that abnormal atrophin 1 accumulates in neurons and interferes with normal cell functions. The dysfunction and eventual death of neurons in many parts of the brain lead to involuntary movements, intellectual decline, and the other characteristic features of DRPLA. "
ATP1A1 ,ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit alpha 1,"The ATP1A1 gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha-1 subunit) of a protein pump known as a Na+/K+ ATPase. This protein uses energy from a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to transport charged atoms (ions) into and out of cells. Specifically, the protein pumps sodium ions (Na+) out of cells and potassium ions (K+) into cells.Na+/K+ ATPases that include the alpha-1 subunit are found in many types of cells, although the pumps appear to play a particularly important role in the adrenal glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. In the adrenal glands, the flow of sodium and potassium ions helps regulate the production of the hormone aldosterone, which controls blood pressure by maintaining proper salt and fluid levels in the body.","Aldosterone-producing adenoma Mutations in the ATP1A1 gene have been found to cause aldosterone-producing adenomas, which are noncancerous (benign) tumors that form in the adrenal glands. The genetic changes involved in these tumors, called somatic mutations, are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in adrenal gland cells that give rise to the tumor. Changes in the ATP1A1 gene account for approximately six percent of cases of aldosterone-producing adenoma.ATP1A1 gene mutations impair the Na+/K+ ATPase's normal function. The abnormal pumps allow sodium or hydrogen (H+) ions to enter the cell. The abnormal flow of these ions increases aldosterone production, resulting in excess aldosterone and leading to high blood pressure (hypertension) and an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Changes in adrenal gland cells due to impaired Na+/K+ ATPase function also increase cell growth and division (proliferation), which promotes adenoma formation. "
ATP1A2 ,ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit alpha 2,"The ATP1A2 gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha-2 subunit) of a protein known as a Na+/K+ ATPase. This protein uses energy from a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to transport charged atoms (ions) into and out of cells. Specifically, it pumps sodium ions (Na+) out of cells and potassium ions (K+) into cells.Na+/K+ ATPases that include the alpha-2 subunit are primarily found in nervous system cells called glia, which protect and maintain nerve cells (neurons). Through its action in glia, the protein plays a critical role in the normal function of neurons. Communication between neurons depends on chemicals called neurotransmitters. To relay signals, a neuron releases neurotransmitters, which attach to receptor proteins on neighboring neurons. After the neurotransmitters have had their effect, they detach from their receptors and are removed from the spaces between neurons by glia. This process is carefully regulated to ensure that signals are transmitted accurately throughout the nervous system. The Na+/K+ ATPase helps regulate this process by stimulating glia to clear neurotransmitters from the spaces between neurons. This protein also removes excess potassium ions from these spaces.","Alternating hemiplegia of childhood At least one mutation in the ATP1A2 gene can cause alternating hemiplegia of childhood. The primary feature of this condition is recurrent episodes of temporary paralysis, often affecting one side of the body (hemiplegia). During some episodes, the paralysis alternates from one side to the other or affects both sides of the body at the same time. The known ATP1A2 gene mutation associated with this condition replaces a single protein building block (amino acid) in Na+/K+ ATPase: the amino acid threonine is replaced with the amino acid asparagine at protein position 378 (written as Thr378Asn or T378N). This genetic change probably impairs the protein's ability to transport ions, although it is unclear how the mutation leads to the specific features of alternating hemiplegia of childhood. "
ATP1A3 ,ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit alpha 3,"The ATP1A3 gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha-3 subunit) of a protein known as Na+/K+ ATPase or the sodium pump. This protein uses energy from a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to transport charged atoms (ions) into and out of cells. Specifically, it pumps sodium ions (Na+) out of cells and potassium ions (K+) into cells.Na+/K+ ATPases that include the alpha-3 subunit are primarily found in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and are critical for their normal function. The movement of sodium and potassium ions helps regulate the electrical activity of these cells and plays an important role in the signaling process that controls muscle movement. The activity of Na+/K+ ATPase also helps regulate cell size (volume).Additionally, Na+/K+ ATPase helps regulate a process called neurotransmitter reuptake. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that transmit signals from one neuron to another. After a neurotransmitter has had its effect, it must be removed quickly from the space between the neurons. The reuptake of neurotransmitters is carefully controlled to ensure that signals are sent and received accurately throughout the nervous system.","Alternating hemiplegia of childhood Mutations in the ATP1A3 gene are the primary cause of a neurological condition called alternating hemiplegia of childhood; at least 25 ATP1A3 gene mutations have been found in affected individuals. This condition is characterized by recurrent episodes of temporary paralysis, often affecting one side of the body (hemiplegia). During some episodes, the paralysis alternates from one side to the other or affects both sides of the body at the same time.Most ATP1A3 gene mutations associated with alternating hemiplegia of childhood change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the alpha-3 subunit of Na+/K+ ATPase. These genetic changes appear to impair the pump's ability to transport ions, although it is unclear how the mutations lead to the specific features of alternating hemiplegia of childhood. "
ATP2A1 ,ATPase sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transporting 1,"The ATP2A1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase 1 (SERCA1). This enzyme belongs to a family of ATPase enzymes that help control the level of positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) inside cells. The SERCA1 enzyme is found in skeletal muscle cells. (Skeletal muscles are the muscles used for movement.) Within muscle cells, the SERCA1 enzyme is located in the membrane of a structure called the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This structure plays a major role in muscle contraction and relaxation by storing and releasing calcium ions. When calcium ions are transported out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, muscles contract; when calcium ions are transported into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, muscles relax. The SERCA1 enzyme transports calcium ions from the cell into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, triggering muscle relaxation.","Brody myopathy At least 10 mutations in the ATP2A1 gene have been found to cause Brody myopathy, a muscle disorder characterized by muscle cramping after exercise. Most ATP2A1 gene mutations lead to a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the SERCA1 enzyme, resulting in a nonfunctional enzyme. Other mutations lead to the production of a SERCA1 enzyme with decreased function. As a result, calcium ions are slow to enter the sarcoplasmic reticulum and muscle relaxation is delayed. After exercise or other strenuous activity, during which the muscles rapidly contract and relax, people with Brody myopathy develop muscle cramps because their muscles cannot fully relax. Scientists believe that other proteins or other pathways may function in the absence of a fully functional SERCA1 enzyme to transport calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and help with muscle relaxation. "
ATP2A2 ,ATPase sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transporting 2,"The ATP2A2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase 2 (SERCA2). This enzyme belongs to a family of ATPase enzymes that helps control the level of positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) inside cells. Within the cell, SERCA2 is found in the endoplasmic reticulum and a related structure in muscle cells called the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum is a structure inside the cell that is involved in protein processing and transport. The sarcoplasmic reticulum assists with muscle contraction and relaxation by releasing and storing calcium ions. Calcium ions act as signals for a large number of activities that are important for the normal development and function of cells. SERCA2 allows calcium ions to pass into and out of the cell in response to cell signals.",Darier disease More than 130 mutations in the ATP2A2 gene have been found to cause Darier disease. Most of these mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the SERCA2 enzyme. All mutations cause the production of a nonfunctional SERCA2 enzyme or cause no SERCA2 to be produced from one copy of the gene. Cells with only one functional copy of the ATP2A2 gene produce half the normal amount of SERCA2 protein. It is thought that insufficient amounts of SERCA2 combined with outside factors such as heat and minor injury cause the signs and symptoms of Darier disease. 
ATP2C1 ,ATPase secretory pathway Ca2+ transporting 1,"The ATP2C1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called hSPCA1. This protein is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-powered calcium pump, which uses energy from ATP molecules to pump charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) across cell membranes. Specifically, the hSPCA1 protein transports calcium ions into a cell structure called the Golgi apparatus, where they are stored until needed. The appropriate storage and release of calcium is essential for many cell activities, including cell growth and division, cell movement, and attachment of cells to one another (cell adhesion).The hSPCA1 protein also transports manganese ions into the Golgi apparatus. Manganese works with a variety of enzymes and is involved in processing newly formed proteins.The hSPCA1 protein is present in cells throughout the body. It appears to be particularly important for the normal function of cells called keratinocytes, which are found in the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis).","Benign chronic pemphigus More than 100 mutations in the ATP2C1 gene have been found to cause benign chronic pemphigus, a rare skin condition characterized by red, raw, and blistered areas of skin. Mutations in this gene reduce the amount of functional hSPCA1 protein, which impairs the storage of calcium ions in the Golgi apparatus. For unknown reasons, this abnormal calcium storage affects keratinocytes more than other types of cells. Problems with calcium regulation impair many cell functions, including cell adhesion. As a result, keratinocytes do not stick tightly to one another, which causes the epidermis to become fragile and less resistant to minor trauma. Because the skin is easily damaged, it develops raw, blistered areas, particularly in skin folds where there is moisture and friction.Although ATP2C1 gene mutations probably also affect the transport of manganese within cells, abnormal manganese regulation is not thought to contribute to the signs and symptoms of benign chronic pemphigus. "
ATP6V0A2 ,ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit a2,"The ATP6V0A2 gene provides instructions for making one part, the a2 subunit, of a large protein complex (a group of proteins that work together). This protein complex is known as a vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase). A V-ATPase acts as a pump to move positively charged hydrogen atoms (protons) across cell membranes.V-ATPases are embedded in the membranes surrounding cells, where they transport protons into and out of cells. This movement of protons helps regulate the relative acidity (pH) of cells and their surrounding environment. Tight control of pH is necessary for most biological reactions to proceed properly.Within cells, V-ATPases help regulate the pH of particular cell compartments. These compartments include endosomes and lysosomes, which digest and recycle materials that the cell no longer needs. Studies suggest that V-ATPases are also involved in the movement (trafficking) of small sac-like structures called vesicles. Vesicles transport many types of molecules within cells.V-ATPases also play a key role in a complex process called glycosylation, in which proteins are modified by adding sugar molecules. Glycosylation is necessary for the normal function of many different kinds of proteins. V-ATPases regulate the pH of a cellular structure called the Golgi apparatus, where glycosylation occurs.","Cutis laxa At least 18 mutations in the ATP6V0A2 gene have been identified in people with cutis laxa. ATP6V0A2 mutations cause a form of the disorder called autosomal recessive cutis laxa type II, which is characterized by loose, sagging skin and distinctive facial features. Some affected individuals also have delayed development, intellectual disability, seizures, and problems with movement that can worsen over time.Mutations in the ATP6V0A2 gene prevent the cell from producing a functional a2 subunit, which disrupts the normal function of V-ATPases. It is unclear how these genetic changes cause the signs and symptoms of cutis laxa. Researchers suspect that changes in V-ATPase function may disrupt the normal glycosylation of proteins, including several that are involved in the assembly and maintenance of elastic fibers. Elastic fibers are slender bundles of proteins that provide strength and flexibility to connective tissue (tissue that supports the body's joints and organs). People with cutis laxa have a reduced density of elastic fibers, which weakens connective tissue in the skin, lungs, and other organs. These defects in connective tissue underlie many of the major features of the disorder. "
ATP6V0A4 ,ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit a4,"The ATP6V0A4 gene provides instructions for making a part (subunit) of a large protein complex known as vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase). V-ATPases are a group of similar complexes that act as pumps to move positively charged hydrogen atoms (protons) across membranes. Because acids are substances that can ""donate"" protons to other molecules, this movement of protons helps regulate the relative acidity (pH) of cells and their surrounding environment. Tight control of pH is necessary for most biological reactions to proceed properly.The V-ATPase that includes the subunit produced from the ATP6V0A4 gene is found in the inner ear and in nephrons, which are the functional structures within the kidneys. The kidneys filter waste products from the blood and remove them in urine. They also reabsorb needed nutrients and release them back into the blood. Each nephron consists of two parts: a renal corpuscle (also known as a glomerulus) that filters the blood, and a renal tubule that reabsorbs substances that are needed and eliminates unneeded substances in urine. The V-ATPase is involved in regulating the amount of acid that is removed from the blood into the urine, and also in maintaining the proper pH of the fluid in the inner ear (endolymph).","Renal tubular acidosis with deafness Several ATP6V0A4 gene mutations have been identified in people with renal tubular acidosis with deafness, a disorder involving excess acid in the blood (metabolic acidosis), bone weakness, and hearing loss caused by changes in the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss).Mutations in the ATP6V0A4 gene impair the function of the V-ATPase proton pump. As a result, the kidneys are less able to control the acidity of the blood, which leads to bone weakness caused by loss of bone minerals (demineralization) and other consequences of metabolic acidosis. The body's capability to control the pH of the fluid in the inner ear is also impaired, resulting in sensorineural hearing loss. "
ATP6V1B1 ,ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit B1,"The ATP6V1B1 gene provides instructions for making a part (subunit) of a large protein complex known as vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase). V-ATPases are a group of similar complexes that act as pumps to move positively charged hydrogen atoms (protons) across membranes. Because acids are substances that can ""donate"" protons to other molecules, this movement of protons helps regulate the relative acidity (pH) of cells and their surrounding environment. Tight control of pH is necessary for most biological reactions to proceed properly.The V-ATPase that includes the subunit produced from the ATP6V1B1 gene is found in the inner ear and in nephrons, which are the functional structures within the kidneys.

Each nephron consists of two parts: a renal corpuscle (also known as a glomerulus) that filters the blood, and a renal tubule that reabsorbs substances that are needed and eliminates unneeded substances in urine. The V-ATPase is involved in regulating the amount of acid that is removed from the blood into the urine, and also in maintaining the proper pH of the fluid in the inner ear (endolymph).","Renal tubular acidosis with deafness More than 25 ATP6V1B1 gene mutations have been identified in people with renal tubular acidosis with deafness, a disorder involving excess acid in the blood (metabolic acidosis), bone weakness, and hearing loss caused by changes in the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss).Mutations in the ATP6V1B1 gene impair the function of the V-ATPase proton pump. As a result, the kidneys are less able to control the acidity of the blood, which leads to bone weakness caused by loss of bone minerals (demineralization) and other consequences of metabolic acidosis. The body's capability to control the pH of the fluid in the inner ear is also impaired, resulting in sensorineural hearing loss. "
ATP7A ,ATPase copper transporting alpha,"The ATP7A gene provides instructions for making a protein that is important for regulating copper levels in the body. Copper is necessary for many cellular functions, but it is toxic when present in excessive amounts. The ATP7A protein is found throughout the body, except in liver cells. In the small intestine, this protein helps control the absorption of copper from food. In other cells, the ATP7A protein has a dual role and shuttles between two cellular locations. The protein normally resides in a cell structure called the Golgi apparatus, which modifies newly produced proteins, including enzymes. In the Golgi apparatus, the ATP7A protein supplies copper to certain enzymes that are critical for the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels, and the nervous system. If copper levels in the cell environment are elevated, however, the ATP7A protein moves to the cell membrane and eliminates excess copper from the cell.","Cutis laxa Several mutations in the ATP7A gene are responsible for a condition called occipital horn syndrome or X-linked cutis laxa, which is considered a mild form of Menkes syndrome. Occipital horn syndrome is characterized by loose and sagging skin, wedge-shaped calcium deposits in a bone at the base of the skull (the occipital bone), coarse hair, and loose joints.Most of the mutations that cause occipital horn syndrome reduce but do not eliminate the production of the ATP7A protein. A shortage of this protein impairs the absorption of copper from food and prevents its normal distribution to cells throughout the body. The decreased supply of copper can reduce the activity of numerous copper-containing enzymes, affecting the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels, and the nervous system. The reduced activity of these enzymes underlies the characteristic features of occipital horn syndrome. "
ATP7B ,ATPase copper transporting beta,"The ATP7B gene provides instructions for making a protein called copper-transporting ATPase 2. This protein is part of the P-type ATPase family, a group of proteins that transport metals into and out of cells by using energy stored in the molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Copper-transporting ATPase 2 is found primarily in the liver, with smaller amounts in the kidneys and brain. It plays a role in the transport of copper from the liver to other parts of the body. Copper is an important part of certain enzymes that maintain normal cell functions. Copper-transporting ATPase 2 is also important for the removal of excess copper from the body.Within liver cells, copper-transporting ATPase 2 is found in a structure called the Golgi apparatus, which modifies newly produced enzymes and other proteins. Here, copper-transporting ATPase 2 supplies copper to a protein called ceruloplasmin, which transports copper to other parts of the body via the blood. If copper levels in the liver get too high, copper-transporting ATPase 2 leaves the Golgi and transfers copper to small sacs (vesicles) for elimination through bile. Bile is a substance produced by the liver that is important for digestion and the removal of waste products.","Wilson disease Researchers have identified more than 250 ATP7B gene mutations that cause Wilson disease. About half the mutations change one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make copper-transporting ATPase 2. This type of mutation alters the 3-dimensional structure of the protein or its stability, preventing copper-transporting ATPase 2 from functioning properly. A common amino acid substitution replaces the amino acid histidine with the amino acid glutamine at position 1069 in the protein (written as His1069Gln or H1069Q). This particular mutation occurs in nearly 40 percent of affected individuals with a Northern or Eastern European ancestry. Approximately one-third of Asians with Wilson disease have a mutation that replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid leucine at position 778 (written as Arg778Leu or R778L). In the Costa Rican population, more than 60 percent of affected individuals have a mutation that replaces the amino acid aspartic acid with the amino acid serine at position 1270 (written as Asp1270Ser or D1270S).Other types of mutations delete or insert small segments of DNA within the ATP7B gene or introduce a stop signal in the gene's instructions for making copper-transporting ATPase 2. As a result, no protein is produced, or an abnormally small protein is made. These types of mutations usually result in symptoms that are more severe than those caused by mutations that change a single amino acid.With a shortage of functional protein, removal of excess copper from the body is impaired. As a result, copper accumulates to toxic levels that can damage tissues and organs, particularly the liver and brain. "
ATP8B1 ,ATPase phospholipid transporting 8B1,"The ATP8B1 gene (also known as FIC1) provides instructions for making a protein that is found throughout the body. It is thought to control the distribution of certain fat molecules known as aminophospholipids on the inner surface of liver cell membranes. Based on this role, the ATP8B1 protein is sometimes known as an aminophospholipid translocase. In particular, this protein performs its function in the membranes of liver cells that transport fat-digesting acids called bile acids into bile, and it likely plays a role in maintaining an appropriate balance of bile acids. This process, known as bile acid homeostasis, is critical for the normal secretion of bile and the proper functioning of liver cells.","Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis Mutations in the ATP8B1 gene can cause benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (BRIC1). People with BRIC1 have occasional episodes of impaired bile secretion that lead to severe itching (pruritus), and yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). Most ATP8B1 gene mutations that cause BRIC1 change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ATP8B1 protein. These mutations likely alter the structure or function of the ATP8B1 protein only moderately. Through unknown mechanisms, mutations in the ATP8B1 gene result in the buildup of bile acids in liver cells, which leads to the signs and symptoms of BRIC1. It is unclear what causes the episodes to begin or end. On occasion, people with BRIC1 have been later diagnosed with a more severe condition called progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (described below) when their symptoms worsened. "
ATRX ,"ATRX, chromatin remodeler","The ATRX gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an essential role in normal development. Although the specific function of the ATRX protein is unknown, studies suggest that it helps regulate the activity (expression) of other genes through a process known as chromatin remodeling. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and protein that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. Chromatin remodeling is one way gene expression is regulated during development. When DNA is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when DNA is loosely packed.The ATRX protein appears to regulate the expression of two genes, HBA1 and HBA2, that are necessary for the production of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells throughout the body. Other genes regulated by the ATRX protein have not been identified.","Alpha thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability syndrome More than 125 mutations in the ATRX gene have been identified in people with alpha thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability syndrome. The most common mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ATRX protein. Other mutations insert or delete genetic material in the ATRX gene or alter how the gene's instructions are used to make the protein.Mutations may destabilize the ATRX protein or affect its interactions with other proteins. These changes prevent the ATRX protein from effectively regulating gene expression. Reduced activity of the HBA1 and HBA2 genes causes a blood disorder called alpha thalassemia. Abnormal expression of additional genes likely causes developmental delay, distinctive facial features, and the other signs and symptoms of alpha thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability syndrome. "
ATXN1 ,ataxin 1,"The ATXN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ataxin-1. This protein is found throughout the body, but its function is unknown. Within cells, ataxin-1 is located in the nucleus. Researchers believe that ataxin-1 may be involved in regulating various aspects of producing proteins, including the first stage of protein production (transcription) and processing RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA.One region of the ATXN1 gene contains a DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (cytosine, adenine, and guanine) that appear multiple times in a row. Normally, the CAG segment is repeated 4 to 39 times within the gene.","Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement. SCA1 results from a mutation in the ATXN1 gene known as a trinucleotide repeat expansion. This mutation increases the length of the repeated CAG segment in the ATXN1 gene. People with SCA1 have from 40 to more than 80 CAG repeats in most cells.The expanded CAG segment leads to the production of an abnormally long version of the ataxin-1 protein that folds into the wrong 3-dimensional shape. This abnormal protein clusters with other proteins to form clumps (aggregates) within the nucleus of cells. These aggregates prevent the ataxin-1 protein from functioning normally, which damages cells. For reasons that are unclear, aggregates of ataxin-1 are found only in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). Certain brain cells called Purkinje cells seem to be particularly sensitive to the accumulation of these aggregates. Purkinje cells are located in the part of the brain that coordinates movement (cerebellum) and are involved in chemical signaling between nerve cells (neurons). The accumulation of protein aggregates in the cells of the central nervous system, particularly in Purkinje cells, leads to cell death. Over time, the loss of these cells causes the movement problems characteristic of SCA1. "
ATXN2 ,ataxin 2,"The ATXN2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ataxin-2. This protein is found throughout the body, but its function is unknown. Ataxin-2 is found in the fluid inside cells (cytoplasm) and seems to interact with a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum is involved in protein production, processing, and transport. Researchers believe that ataxin-2 may be involved in processing RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. Ataxin-2 is also thought to play a role in the translation of genetic information to produce proteins.One region of the ATXN2 gene contains a DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (cytosine, adenine, and guanine) that appear multiple times in a row. Normally, the CAG segment is repeated approximately 22 times within the gene.","Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement. SCA2 results from a mutation in the ATXN2 gene known as a trinucleotide repeat expansion. This mutation increases the length of the repeated CAG segment in the ATXN2 gene. People with 32 or more repeats CAG repeats in the ATXN2 gene develop SCA2.It is unclear how the abnormally long CAG segment affects the function of the ataxin-2 protein. The abnormal protein apparently leads to cell death, as people with SCA2 show a loss of brain cells. Certain brain cells called Purkinje cells seem to be particularly sensitive to the presence of abnormal ataxin-2. Purkinje cells are located in the part of the brain that coordinates movement (cerebellum) and are involved in chemical signaling between nerve cells (neurons). It is unknown how the abnormal ataxin-2 protein leads to the death of Purkinje and other brain cells. Over time, the loss of these cells causes the movement problems characteristic of SCA2. "
ATXN3 ,ataxin 3,"The ATXN3 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called ataxin-3, which is found in cells throughout the body. Ataxin-3 is involved in a mechanism called the ubiquitin-proteasome system that destroys and gets rid of excess or damaged proteins. The molecule ubiquitin attaches (binds) to unneeded proteins and tags them to be broken down (degraded) within cells. Ataxin-3 removes (cleaves) the ubiquitin from these unwanted proteins just before they are degraded so that the ubiquitin can be used again. Due to its role in cleaving ubiquitin from proteins, ataxin-3 is known as a deubiquitinating enzyme.Researchers believe that ataxin-3 also may be involved in regulating the first stage of protein production (transcription).","Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement. SCA3 results from a mutation in the ATXN3 gene known as a trinucleotide repeat expansion. This mutation increases the length of the repeated CAG segment in the ATXN3 gene. People with SCA3 have more than 50 CAG repeats.The expanded CAG segment leads to the production of an abnormally long version of the ataxin-3 protein that folds into the wrong 3-dimensional shape. This nonfunctional ataxin-3 protein cannot remove ubiquitin from proteins that are no longer needed. As a result, these unwanted proteins, along with ubiquitin and ataxin-3, cluster together to form clumps (aggregates) within the nucleus of the cells. It is unclear how these aggregates affect cell function, because they are found in healthy cells as well as those that die.Nerve cells (neurons) and other types of brain cells are most affected by mutations in the ATXN3 gene. SCA3 is associated with cell death in the part of the brain that is connected to the spinal cord (the brainstem), the part of the brain involved in coordinating movements (the cerebellum), and other areas of the brain. This condition is also associated with the death of neurons in the spinal cord. Over time, the loss of cells in the brain and spinal cord cells cause the signs and symptoms characteristic of SCA3. "
AUH ,AU RNA binding methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase,"The AUH gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase. This enzyme is found in cell structures called mitochondria, which convert energy from food into a form that cells can use. Within mitochondria, this enzyme plays an important role in breaking down proteins into smaller molecules that cells can use to produce energy. Specifically, 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase is responsible for the fifth step in breaking down the protein building block (amino acid) leucine. The enzyme converts a molecule called 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA into another molecule called 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA.3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase also has the ability to attach (bind) to RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. Researchers are working to determine the purpose of this RNA-binding ability.","3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency At least 11 mutations in the AUH gene have been found to cause 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency. This condition causes neurological problems such as movement disorders and problems with thinking ability (cognition). The mutations that cause this condition lead to an absence of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase enzyme activity. Without any functional 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase, the breakdown of leucine is incomplete. As a result, 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA is diverted into an alternative pathway and broken down into multiple acids: 3-methylglutaconic acid, 3-methylglutaric acid, and 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid. These acids accumulate in the body's fluids, causing elevated levels of acid in the blood (metabolic acidosis) and release of large amounts of these acids in urine (aciduria). Researchers speculate that an accumulation of these acids in the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord (the cerebrospinal fluid or CSF) can damage these structures and contribute to the neurological features of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency. "
AURKC ,aurora kinase C,"The AURKC gene provides instructions for making a protein called aurora kinase C. This protein regulates certain events during cell division. Cell division occurs when a cell replicates and splits its contents, separating into two new cells. Aurora kinase C helps the two dividing cells separate from each other and ensures that these cells each contain a complete set of chromosomes. Aurora kinase C is most abundant in male testes, which are the male reproductive organs in which sperm are produced and stored. In the testes, this protein regulates the division of sperm cells, ensuring that every new sperm cell divides properly and contains one copy of each chromosome.","Macrozoospermia At least four mutations in the AURKC gene have been found to cause macrozoospermia. This condition causes males to have abnormal sperm, which leads to an inability to father biological children (infertility). AURKC gene mutations that cause macrozoospermia lead to the production of a nonfunctional protein or a protein that is quickly broken down. One mutation that is a frequent cause of this condition in men of North African descent deletes a single DNA building block (nucleotide) from the AURKC gene (written 144delC). The protein produced from the altered gene is abnormally short and nonfunctional.A lack of aurora kinase C blocks cell division in sperm cells. As a result, sperm cells have extra chromosomes, usually four copies of each instead of the usual one. This increase in chromosome number enlarges the sperm cell head and leads to the presence of multiple tails (flagella). Because of the additional genetic material, if one of these abnormal sperm cells combines with an egg cell, the embryo will not develop or the pregnancy will result in miscarriage. "
AVP ,arginine vasopressin,"The AVP gene provides instructions for making a hormone called vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH starts out as a larger molecule called a preprohormone, which is cut (cleaved) and modified to produce the active hormone and several related proteins. The preprohormone is made in a region of the brain called the hypothalamus. It is then transported to the nearby pituitary gland, where active ADH is stored until it is needed.The major function of ADH is to help control the body's water balance by determining how much water is excreted in urine. Normally, when a person's fluid intake is low or when a lot of fluid is lost (for example, through sweating), the pituitary gland releases more ADH into the bloodstream. High levels of this hormone direct the kidneys to reabsorb more water and to make less urine. When fluid intake is adequate, the pituitary gland releases less ADH. Lower levels of this hormone cause the kidneys to reabsorb less water and to make more urine.","Neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus At least 60 mutations in the AVP gene have been found to cause neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the preprohormone or result in the production of an abnormally short version of this molecule. Studies suggest that the altered preprohormone becomes trapped inside the cells where it is produced instead of being transported to the pituitary gland. As the defective molecule builds up over time, it damages and ultimately kills these cells. The resulting shortage of ADH prevents the kidneys from reabsorbing water as they should, and the body makes excessive amounts of urine. These problems with water balance are characteristic of neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus. "
AVPR2 ,arginine vasopressin receptor 2,"The AVPR2 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as the vasopressin V2 receptor. This receptor works together with a hormone called vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in the kidneys. The vasopressin V2 receptor is found in structures called collecting ducts, which are a series of small tubes that reabsorb water from the kidneys into the bloodstream.The interaction between ADH and the vasopressin V2 receptor triggers chemical reactions that control the body's water balance. When a person's fluid intake is low or when a lot of fluid is lost (for example, through sweating), the body produces more ADH. This hormone attaches (binds) to the vasopressin V2 receptor and directs the kidneys to concentrate urine by reabsorbing some of the water back into the bloodstream. When fluid intake is adequate, less ADH is available to interact with the vasopressin V2 receptor. At these times, less water is reabsorbed into the bloodstream and the urine is more dilute.","Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus More than 200 mutations in the AVPR2 gene have been identified in people with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Most of these mutations cause the vasopressin V2 receptor protein to be misfolded into an incorrect 3-dimensional shape. The misfolded protein is trapped within the cell, where it is unable to reach the cell surface to interact with ADH. Less common mutations in the AVPR2 gene prevent the production of any vasopressin V2 receptor protein or lead to a version of the protein that reaches the cell surface but cannot partner with ADH.Without functional vasopressin V2 receptors, the kidneys are unable to respond to signals from ADH. As a result, collecting ducts do not reabsorb water as they should, and the body makes excessive amounts of urine. These problems with water balance are characteristic of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. "
B3GLCT ,beta 3-glucosyltransferase,"The B3GLCT gene (formerly known as B3GALTL) provides instructions for making an enzyme called beta 3-glucosyltransferase (B3Glc-T), which is involved in the complex process of adding sugar molecules to proteins (glycosylation). Glycosylation modifies proteins so they can perform a wider variety of functions. The B3Glc-T enzyme is involved in a two-step glycosylation pathway that results in the formation of a sugar structure, made up of the sugars fucose and glucose, on a specific location of several different proteins. The B3Glc-T enzyme is responsible for the second step, which adds a glucose molecule to the fucose molecule already attached to the protein. The B3GLCT gene is normally turned on (active) in most cells of the body, which suggests that the B3Glc-T enzyme plays an important role across many cell types.","Peters plus syndrome At least 10 mutations that cause Peters plus syndrome have been identified in the B3GLCT gene. Peters plus syndrome is characterized by eye abnormalities, short stature, intellectual disability, and distinctive facial features. The most common B3GLCT gene mutation replaces the DNA building block (nucleotide) guanine with the nucleotide adenine near an area of the gene called exon 8 (written as 660+1G>A). This mutation disrupts how genetic information is pieced together to produce the B3Glc-T enzyme. The resulting enzyme is abnormally short and nonfunctional. It is unclear how the loss of functional B3Glc-T enzyme leads to the signs and symptoms of Peters plus syndrome, but impaired glycosylation likely disrupts the function of many proteins, which may contribute to the variety of features. "
BAP1 ,BRCA1 associated protein 1,"The BAP1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase BAP1 (shortened to BAP1). This protein functions as a deubiquitinase, which means it removes a molecule called ubiquitin from certain proteins. The presence of ubiquitin molecules on a protein can affect the activity of the protein and its interactions with other proteins. The ubiquitin ""tag"" also promotes breakdown (degradation) of a protein. By removing ubiquitin, BAP1 helps regulate the function of many proteins involved in diverse cellular processes. The BAP1 protein is thought to help control cell growth and division (proliferation) and cell death. Studies suggest that it is involved in the progression of cells through the step-by-step process they take to replicate themselves (called the cell cycle) and that it plays roles in repairing damaged DNA and controlling the activity of genes.Although the exact mechanism is unclear, the BAP1 protein acts as a tumor suppressor. Tumor suppressor proteins help prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.","BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome Mutations in the BAP1 gene cause BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome. People with this condition have an increased risk of developing many types of noncancerous (benign) and cancerous (malignant) tumors, particularly certain tumors of the skin (atypical Spitz tumors, cutaneous melanoma, and basal cell carcinoma); eyes (uveal melanoma); kidneys (clear cell renal cell carcinoma); and a tissue called the mesothelium that lines the chest, abdomen, and internal organs (malignant mesothelioma). Researchers are still determining whether other forms of cancer are linked to BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome.Affected individuals inherit a mutation in one copy of the BAP1 gene. These mutations, which are present in essentially every cell of the body, are classified as germline mutations. Most germline BAP1 gene mutations lead to an abnormally short BAP1 protein that is likely broken down prematurely. Other germline mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the BAP1 protein and likely impair its function. In most cases, a second, non-inherited (somatic) mutation occurs in the normal copy of the gene in cells that give rise to tumors. Together, the germline and somatic mutations lead to a loss of BAP1 protein function in tumor cells.Reduction or loss of this protein's function likely prevents the removal of ubiquitin molecules from certain proteins. Although it is unclear exactly how changes in BAP1 function lead to BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome, researchers speculate that altered activity of proteins normally regulated by BAP1 deubiquitination may promote cell proliferation or survival, resulting in tumor formation. "
BBS1 ,Bardet-Biedl syndrome 1,"The BBS1 gene provides instructions for making a protein found in cells throughout the body. The BBS1 protein is part of a group (complex) of proteins that plays a critical role in the formation of cell structures called cilia. Cilia are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of many types of cells. They are involved in cell movement and many different chemical signaling pathways. Cilia are also necessary for the perception of sensory input (such as sight, hearing, and smell).","Bardet-Biedl syndrome More than 30 mutations in the BBS1 gene have been identified in people with Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Mutations in this gene are the most common cause of Bardet-Biedl syndrome, accounting for about one-quarter of all cases.Most BBS1 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the BBS1 protein or lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the protein. The most common mutation replaces the amino acid methionine with the amino acid arginine at protein position 390 (written as Met390Arg or M390R).Mutations in the BBS1 gene likely affect the normal formation and function of cilia. Defects in these cell structures probably disrupt important chemical signaling pathways during development and lead to abnormalities of sensory perception. Researchers believe that defective cilia are responsible for most of the features of Bardet-Biedl syndrome, including vision loss, obesity, the presence of extra fingers and/or toes (polydactyly), kidney abnormalities, and intellectual disability. "
BBS10 ,Bardet-Biedl syndrome 10,"The BBS10 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in many types of cells. The BBS10 protein is part of a group (complex) of proteins that functions as a chaperonin. Chaperonins help fold other proteins into their correct 3-dimensional shapes so they can perform their usual functions in the body.Studies suggest that the BBS10 protein helps fold or stabilize certain proteins that are necessary for the normal formation of cilia. Cilia are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of many types of cells. They are involved in cell movement and many different chemical signaling pathways. Cilia are also necessary for the perception of sensory input (such as sight, hearing, and smell).","Bardet-Biedl syndrome More than 35 mutations in the BBS10 gene have been found to cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Mutations in this gene account for about 20 percent of all cases of the disorder.Some BBS10 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the BBS10 protein, while other mutations add or delete genetic material in the BBS10 gene. The most common BBS10 gene mutation, which is written as C91fsX95, leads to the production of an abnormally short version of the BBS10 protein.Researchers are studying how mutations in the BBS10 gene lead to the specific features of Bardet-Biedl syndrome. A malfunctioning BBS10 protein appears to affect the normal formation and function of cilia. Defects in these cell structures probably disrupt important chemical signaling pathways during development and lead to abnormalities of sensory perception. Researchers believe that defective cilia are responsible for most of the features of Bardet-Biedl syndrome, including vision loss, obesity, the presence of extra fingers and/or toes (polydactyly), kidney abnormalities, and intellectual disability. "
BCHE ,butyrylcholinesterase,"The BCHE gene provides instructions for making the pseudocholinesterase enzyme, also known as butyrylcholinesterase, which is produced by the liver and circulates in the blood. The pseudocholinesterase enzyme is involved in the breakdown of certain drugs, including muscle relaxant drugs called choline esters that are used during general anesthesia. These drugs are given to relax the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles), including the muscles involved in breathing, and are often employed in emergencies when a breathing tube must be inserted quickly.Pseudocholinesterase also helps protect the body by breaking down certain toxic substances before they reach the nerves. These substances include certain pesticides, poisons that attack the nerves, and specific natural toxins including a compound called solanine found in green potato skin. It is likely that the enzyme has other functions in the body, but these functions are not well understood. Studies suggest that the enzyme may be involved in the transmission of nerve signals.","Pseudocholinesterase deficiency More than 50 mutations in the BCHE gene have been identified in people with pseudocholinesterase deficiency, a condition that results in increased sensitivity to choline esters and certain other drugs. Some of these mutations replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the pseudocholinesterase enzyme, resulting in an abnormal enzyme that does not function properly. Other mutations prevent the production of pseudocholinesterase. A lack (deficiency) of functional pseudocholinesterase enzyme impairs the body's ability to break down choline ester drugs efficiently, leading to abnormally prolonged drug effects. "
BCKDHA ,"branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase E1, alpha polypeptide","The BCKDHA gene provides instructions for making one part, the alpha subunit, of a group of enzymes called the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD) enzyme complex. Two alpha subunits connect with two beta subunits, which are produced from the BCKDHB gene, to form a critical piece of the enzyme complex called the E1 component.The BCKD enzyme complex is responsible for one step in the normal breakdown of three protein building blocks (amino acids). These amino acids—leucine, isoleucine, and valine—are obtained from the diet. They are present in many kinds of food, particularly protein-rich foods such as milk, meat, and eggs. The BCKD enzyme complex is active in mitochondria, which are specialized structures inside cells that serve as energy-producing centers. The breakdown of leucine, isoleucine, and valine produces molecules that can be used for energy.","Maple syrup urine disease More than 80 mutations in the BCKDHA gene have been identified in people with maple syrup urine disease. These mutations most often cause the severe, classic form of the disorder, which becomes apparent soon after birth. Maple syrup urine disease gets its name from the distinctive sweet odor of affected infants' urine. It is also characterized by poor feeding, vomiting, lack of energy (lethargy), abnormal movements, and delayed development.Most BCKDHA mutations change single amino acids in the alpha subunit of the BCKD enzyme complex. In the Old Order Mennonite population, where maple syrup urine disease occurs frequently, the most common mutation replaces the amino acid tyrosine with the amino acid asparagine at position 438 (written as Tyr438Asn or Y438N).Mutations in the BCKDHA gene disrupt the normal function of the BCKD enzyme complex, preventing it from effectively breaking down leucine, isoleucine, and valine. As a result, these amino acids and their byproducts build up in the body. This accumulation is toxic to cells and tissues, particularly in the nervous system. The buildup of these substances can lead to seizures, developmental delay, and the other health problems associated with maple syrup urine disease. "
BCKDHB ,branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase E1 subunit beta,"The BCKDHB gene provides instructions for making one part, the beta subunit, of a group of enzymes called the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD) enzyme complex. Two beta subunits connect with two alpha subunits, which are produced from the BCKDHA gene, to form a critical piece of the enzyme complex called the E1 component.The BCKD enzyme complex is responsible for one step in the normal breakdown of three protein building blocks (amino acids). These amino acids—leucine, isoleucine, and valine—are obtained from the diet. They are present in many kinds of food, particularly protein-rich foods such as milk, meat, and eggs. The BCKD enzyme complex is active in mitochondria, which are specialized structures inside cells that serve as energy-producing centers. The breakdown of leucine, isoleucine, and valine produces molecules that can be used for energy.","Maple syrup urine disease More than 90 mutations in the BCKDHB gene have been identified in people with maple syrup urine disease. These mutations most often cause the severe, classic form of the disorder, which becomes apparent soon after birth. Maple syrup urine disease gets its name from the distinctive sweet odor of affected infants' urine. It is also characterized by poor feeding, vomiting, lack of energy (lethargy), abnormal movements, and delayed development.Most BCKDHB gene mutations change single amino acids in the beta subunit of the BCKD enzyme complex. Other mutations insert or delete small amounts of DNA in the gene. A particular mutation is most common in people of Ashkenazi (eastern and central European) Jewish descent; this mutation replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid proline at position 183 in the beta subunit (written as Arg183Pro or R183P).Mutations in the BCKDHB gene disrupt the normal function of the BCKD enzyme complex, preventing it from effectively breaking down leucine, isoleucine, and valine. As a result, these amino acids and their byproducts build up in the body. This accumulation is toxic to cells and tissues, particularly in the nervous system. The buildup of these substances can lead to seizures, developmental delay, and the other health problems associated with maple syrup urine disease. "
BCOR ,BCL6 corepressor,"The BCOR gene provides instructions for making a protein known as the BCL6 corepressor. A corepressor is a protein that cannot attach (bind) to DNA by itself, but interacts with other DNA-binding proteins to suppress the activity of certain genes. In this case, the BCL6 corepressor partners with the DNA-binding protein produced from the BCL6 gene. The BCL6 gene plays an important role in the function and survival of certain immune system cells.Researchers have found that the BCOR gene is active throughout the body, not just in the immune system. This widespread activity suggests that the BCL6 corepressor has other functions in addition to its interaction with the BCL6 protein. The BCL6 corepressor appears to play a critical role in early embryonic development, including the formation of the eyes and several other tissues and organs. Scientists believe that the BCL6 corepressor may also be involved in specifying the left and right sides of the body in the developing embryo.","Lenz microphthalmia syndrome A mutation in the BCOR gene has been found in one family with Lenz microphthalmia syndrome. This mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the BCL6 corepressor, which alters the protein's structure. Specifically, the mutation replaces the amino acid proline with the amino acid leucine at position 85 (written as Pro85Leu). Because the BCL6 corepressor plays an essential role in early development, a defective version of the protein disrupts the normal formation of the eyes and several other organs and tissues before birth.The BCOR gene is on the X chromosome (one of the two sex chromosomes) and the inheritance of Lenz microphthalmia is described as X-linked recessive. X-linked recessive disorders occur much more commonly in males than in females. Lenz microphthalmia syndrome has been found only in males. "
BCR ,"BCR, RhoGEF and GTPase activating protein","The BCR gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not completely understood. Studies show that the BCR protein may act as a GTPase activating protein (GAP). GAPs turn off (inactivate) proteins called GTPases, which play an important role in chemical signaling within cells. Often referred to as molecular switches, GTPases can be turned on and off. They are turned on (active) when they are attached (bound) to a molecule called GTP and are turned off when they are bound to another molecule called GDP. The BCR protein inactivates a GTPase known as Rac1 by stimulating a reaction that turns the attached GTP into GDP. Through this activity, the BCR protein helps regulate the movement (migration) and function of cells.The BCR protein can also act as a kinase, which is an enzyme that changes the activity of other proteins by adding a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) at specific positions. BCR's kinase activity is likely involved in regulating signaling within cells, although its exact role is unclear.","Chronic myeloid leukemia A genetic rearrangement (translocation) involving the BCR gene causes a type of cancer of blood-forming cells called chronic myeloid leukemia. This slow-growing cancer leads to an overproduction of abnormal white blood cells. Common features of the condition include excessive tiredness (fatigue), fever, weight loss, and an enlarged spleen.The translocation involved in this condition, written as t(9;22), fuses part of the ABL1 gene from chromosome 9 with part of the BCR gene from chromosome 22, creating an abnormal fusion gene called BCR-ABL1. The abnormal chromosome 22, containing a piece of chromosome 9 and the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, is commonly called the Philadelphia chromosome. The translocation is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in the abnormal blood cells. This type of genetic change, called a somatic mutation, is not inherited.The protein produced from the abnormal fusion gene, called BCR-ABL1, signals for cells to grow and divide and blocks the self-destruction of cells that are abnormal or unneeded. The BCR-ABL1 protein is always turned on, so growth and division of affected blood cells is uncontrolled, leading to overproduction of the abnormal cells.The presence of the Philadelphia chromosome provides a target for molecular therapies. "
BCS1L ,"BCS1 homolog, ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex chaperone","The BCS1L gene provides instructions for making a protein that functions in cell structures called mitochondria, which convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. The BCS1L protein is critical for the formation of a group of proteins known as complex III. Specifically, BCS1L adds a component called Rieske Fe/S protein to the complex. In mitochondria, complex III performs one step of the multistep process known as oxidative phosphorylation, in which oxygen and simple sugars are used to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source.As a byproduct of its action in oxidative phosphorylation, complex III produces reactive oxygen species, which are harmful molecules that can damage DNA and tissues. The reactive oxygen species produced by complex III are thought to also play a role in normal cell signaling, particularly when levels of oxygen in the body are low (hypoxia).Some researchers believe the BCS1L protein is involved in the breakdown (metabolism) of iron, although the mechanism is unknown.","Björnstad syndrome At least six BCS1L gene mutations have been found to cause Björnstad syndrome, a condition characterized by a hair abnormality known as pili torti (or ""twisted hair"") and hearing loss. BCS1L gene mutations associated with this condition alter the BCS1L protein and impair its ability to interact with other proteins. These changes reduce BCS1L's ability to add the Rieske Fe/S protein to complex III. As a result, complex III is incomplete, and excess Rieske Fe/S protein builds up in mitochondria. The resulting decrease in complex III activity reduces oxidative phosphorylation to approximately 60 percent of normal.Studies show that in people with Björnstad syndrome, complex III produces little or no reactive oxygen species; however, for unknown reasons, another protein complex involved in oxidative phosphorylation called complex I produces excessive amounts of reactive oxygen species, even more than would be produced by normally functioning complex III. Researchers believe that tissues in the inner ears and hair follicles are particularly sensitive to reactive oxygen species and are damaged by the abnormal amount of these molecules, leading to the characteristic features of Björnstad syndrome. It is unclear if a lack of cellular energy due to the reduction of complex III function also contributes to the features of this condition. "
BDNF ,brain derived neurotrophic factor,"The BDNF gene provides instructions for making a protein found in the brain and spinal cord called brain-derived neurotrophic factor. This protein promotes the survival of nerve cells (neurons) by playing a role in the growth, maturation (differentiation), and maintenance of these cells. In the brain, the BDNF protein is active at the connections between nerve cells (synapses), where cell-to-cell communication occurs. The synapses can change and adapt over time in response to experience, a characteristic called synaptic plasticity. The BDNF protein helps regulate synaptic plasticity, which is important for learning and memory.The BDNF protein is found in regions of the brain that control eating, drinking, and body weight; the protein likely contributes to the management of these functions.",Opioid addiction Genetics Home Reference provides information about opioid addiction. 
BEST1 ,bestrophin 1,"The BEST1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called bestrophin-1, which appears to play a critical role in normal vision. Bestrophin-1 is found in a thin layer of cells at the back of the eye called the retinal pigment epithelium. This cell layer supports and nourishes the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. The retinal pigment epithelium is involved in the growth and development of the eye, maintenance of the retina, and the normal function of specialized cells called photoreceptors that detect light and color.Bestrophin-1 functions as a channel across cell membranes in the retinal pigment epithelium. Charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions) are transported through these channels in response to cellular signals. Some studies suggest that bestrophin-1 may also help regulate the entry of charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) into cells of the retinal pigment epithelium. Other potential functions of bestrophin-1 are under study.","Vitelliform macular dystrophy More than 100 mutations in the BEST1 gene have been identified in people with vitelliform macular dystrophy. These mutations can cause either the early-onset form of the disorder (known as Best disease) or the adult-onset form. Both types of vitelliform macular dystrophy are characterized by the buildup of a fatty yellow pigment (lipofuscin) in cells of the retinal pigment epithelium. Over time, the abnormal accumulation of this substance can damage the photoreceptors that are critical for sharp central vision.Most BEST1 mutations involved in vitelliform macular dystrophy change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in bestrophin-1. The altered protein probably forms an abnormally shaped channel that cannot properly regulate the flow of chloride ions into or out of cells in the retinal pigment epithelium. It remains unclear how this defect is related to the buildup of lipofuscin and a progressive loss of central vision in people with vitelliform macular dystrophy. "
BICD2 ,BICD cargo adaptor 2,"The BICD2 gene provides instructions for making one of a family of proteins called golgins. Golgins help maintain the structure of a cell component called the Golgi apparatus, in which newly produced proteins are modified so they can carry out their functions.The BICD2 protein is found in all cells. The protein attaches (binds) to a group of proteins called the dynein complex, turning it on (activating it) and helping it bind to other cellular materials for transport. During transport, BICD2 stabilizes the dynein complex along a track-like system of small tubes called microtubules, similar to a conveyer belt. The BICD2 protein helps the dynein complex with protein transport, positioning of cell compartments, mobility of structures within the cell, and many other cell processes.In nerve cells (neurons), the BICD2 protein helps the dynein complex transport sac-like structures called synaptic vesicles. These structures contain chemical messengers that allow neighboring cells to communicate with one another.","Spinal muscular atrophy with lower extremity predominance At least six mutations in the BICD2 gene have been found to cause spinal muscular atrophy with lower extremity predominance (SMA-LED). This condition is characterized by muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) in the lower limbs that often begins in infancy or childhood.The BICD2 gene mutations that cause SMA-LED replace single protein building blocks (amino acids). One mutation that has been found in multiple affected individuals and families replaces the amino acid serine with the amino acid leucine at position 107 in the BICD2 protein (written as Ser107Leu or S107L). This change and the other BICD2 gene mutations increase the activity of the BICD2 protein. Overactivity of the BICD2 protein changes its ability to bind with the dynein complex, leading to reduced movement of proteins, synaptic vesicles, and other materials within cells. Decreased synaptic vesicle transport in neurons that control muscle movement (motor neurons), leading to impaired growth of neurons, is thought to contribute to the muscle weakness and atrophy experienced by people with SMA-LED. It is unclear why this condition primarily affects the lower limbs.Additionally, BICD2 gene mutations impair the protein's ability to maintain the structure of the Golgi apparatus within cells. As a result, the Golgi apparatus breaks down into small fragments and the altered BICD2 protein becomes trapped within these fragments. Loss of these cell components likely further contributes to the signs and symptoms of SMA-LED. "
BIN1 ,bridging integrator 1,"The BIN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in tissues throughout the body, where it interacts with a variety of other proteins. The BIN1 protein is thought to be involved in the transportation of materials from the cell surface into the cell (endocytosis) and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). The BIN1 protein may act as a tumor suppressor protein, which means it prevents cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.Several different versions (isoforms) of the BIN1 protein are produced from the BIN1 gene. These isoforms vary by size and are active in different tissues. The BIN1 protein isoform that is expressed in muscle cells is thought to be involved in the formation of structures called transverse tubules or T tubules. These structures are found within the membrane of muscle cells, where they play a role in muscle tensing (contraction) and relaxation.","Centronuclear myopathy At least 10 mutations in the BIN1 gene have been found to cause centronuclear myopathy, a condition that is characterized by muscle weakness (myopathy) in the skeletal muscles, which are the muscles used for movement. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the BIN1 protein. BIN1 gene mutations result in the production of a protein that cannot form T tubules. A shortage of T tubules in muscle fibers alters their structure, which prevents them from contracting and relaxing normally. The abnormal muscle fibers underlie the muscle weakness characteristic of centronuclear myopathy. "
BLM ,BLM RecQ like helicase,"The BLM gene provides instructions for making a member of a protein family called RecQ helicases. Helicases are enzymes that attach (bind) to DNA and unwind the two spiral strands (double helix) of the DNA molecule. This unwinding is necessary for several processes in the cell nucleus, including copying (replicating) DNA in preparation for cell division and repairing damaged DNA. Because RecQ helicases help maintain the structure and integrity of DNA, they are known as the ""caretakers of the genome.""When a cell prepares to divide to form two cells, the DNA that makes up the chromosomes is copied so that each new cell will have two copies of each chromosome, one from each parent. The copied DNA from each chromosome is arranged into two identical structures, called sister chromatids, which are attached to one another during the early stages of cell division. Sister chromatids occasionally exchange small sections of DNA during this time, a process called sister chromatid exchange. Researchers suggest that these exchanges may be a response to DNA damage during the copying process. The BLM protein helps to prevent excess sister chromatid exchanges and is also involved in other processes that help maintain the stability of the DNA during the copying process.","Bloom syndrome More than 70 BLM gene mutations have been identified in people with Bloom syndrome, an inherited disorder characterized by short stature, a skin rash that develops after exposure to the sun, and a greatly increased risk of cancer. One particular BLM gene mutation causes almost all cases of Bloom syndrome among people of Central and Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish descent. This mutation deletes six DNA building blocks (nucleotides) and replaces them with seven others at position 2281 (written as 2281 delta 6ins7, or blmAsh). The blmAsh mutation results in the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the BLM protein. Other BLM gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the protein sequence or create a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the protein. These mutations also reduce the amount of functional BLM protein.As a result of the lack of functional BLM protein, the frequency of sister chromatid exchange is about 10 times higher than average. Exchange of DNA between chromosomes derived from the individual's mother and father are also increased in people with BLM gene mutations. In addition, chromosome breakage occurs more frequently in affected individuals. All of these changes are associated with gaps and breaks in the genetic material that impair normal cell activities and cause the health problems associated with this condition. Without the BLM protein, the cell is less able to repair DNA damage caused by ultraviolet light, which results in increased sun sensitivity. Genetic changes that allow cells to divide in an uncontrolled way lead to the cancers that occur in people with Bloom syndrome. "
BMPR1A ,bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1A,"The BMPR1A gene provides instructions for making a protein called bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1A. This receptor protein has a specific site into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. Specifically, the BMPR1A protein attaches (binds) to ligands in the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) pathway. This signaling pathway allows the environment outside the cell to affect how the cell produces other proteins. The BMPR1A receptor protein and its ligands are involved in transmitting chemical signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus.When the BMPR1A protein is bound to a ligand, it turns on (activates) a group of related proteins (a protein complex) called SMAD proteins. The activated SMAD protein complex is then transported into the cell's nucleus, where it regulates cell growth and division (proliferation) and the activity of particular genes.","Juvenile polyposis syndrome More than 60 mutations in the BMPR1A gene have been found to cause juvenile polyposis syndrome. Most BMPR1A gene mutations result in the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein. As a result, the BMPR1A protein cannot bind to ligands in the TGF-β pathway. This disruption in binding interferes with the activation of the SMAD protein complex. This inactive complex is not transported to the nucleus, where it is needed to regulate cell growth and the activity of certain genes. Unregulated cell growth can lead to polyp formation in people with juvenile polyposis syndrome. "
BMPR2 ,bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2,"The BMPR2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2. The BMPR2 gene belongs to a family of genes originally identified for its role in regulating the growth and maturation (differentiation) of bone and cartilage. Recently, researchers have found that this gene family plays a broader role in regulating the growth and differentiation of numerous types of cells.Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 spans the cell membrane, so that one end of the protein is on the outer surface of the cell and the other end remains inside the cell. This positioning allows the protein to receive and transmit signals that help the cell respond to its environment by growing and dividing (cell proliferation) or by undergoing controlled cell death (apoptosis). This balance of cell proliferation and apoptosis regulates the number of cells in tissues.","Pulmonary arterial hypertension Researchers have identified more than 350 BMPR2 gene mutations that can cause pulmonary arterial hypertension, a condition characterized by abnormally high blood pressure (hypertension) in the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs (the pulmonary artery). About half of the mutations involved in this condition disrupt the assembly of bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2, reducing the amount of this protein in cells. Other mutations prevent bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 from reaching the cell surface or alter its structure so it cannot receive or transmit signals.It remains unclear how BMPR2 gene mutations cause pulmonary arterial hypertension. Researchers suggest that a mutation in this gene promotes cell proliferation or prevents cell death, resulting in an overgrowth of cells in the smallest arteries throughout the lungs. As a result, these arteries narrow in diameter, which increases the resistance to blood flow through the lungs. To overcome the increased resistance, blood pressure increases in the pulmonary artery and in the right ventricle of the heart, which is the chamber that pumps blood into the pulmonary artery. Signs and symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension occur when increased blood pressure cannot fully overcome the elevated resistance, and blood flow to the body is insufficient. "
BOLA3 ,bolA family member 3,"The BOLA3 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not well understood. The BOLA3 protein is thought to be involved in the formation of molecules called iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters or in the attachment of these clusters to other proteins. Certain proteins require attachment of Fe-S clusters to function properly.Two versions (isoforms) of the BOLA3 protein are produced from the BOLA3 gene. One version is found in cellular structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria are the energy-producing centers of cells. In these structures, several proteins carry out a series of chemical steps to convert the energy in food into a form that cells can use. Many of the proteins involved in this process require Fe-S clusters to function, including protein complexes called complex I, complex II, and complex III.Fe-S clusters are also required for another mitochondrial protein to function; this protein is involved in the modification of additional proteins that aid in energy production in mitochondria, including the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. This modification is also critical to the function of the glycine cleavage system, a set of proteins that breaks down a protein building block (amino acid) called glycine when levels become too high.The other version of the BOLA3 protein is found in the fluid-filled space inside the cell (the cytoplasm). While this protein is likely involved in Fe-S cluster formation in the cytoplasm, the role of this isoform is not well understood.","Multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome At least three mutations in the BOLA3 gene have been found to cause multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome. This severe condition is characterized by impairment of more than one mitochondrial function, such as reduced activity of complex I, II, or III, pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, or the glycine cleavage system. Affected infants often have severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy) and elevated levels of a chemical called lactic acid in the body (lactic acidosis). These babies usually do not survive past infancy.BOLA3 gene mutations lead to production of an altered protein that is likely broken down quickly. Although some mutations affect both isoforms of the BOLA3 protein, loss of the mitochondrial version appears to be responsible for the condition. The lack of mitochondrial BOLA3 protein impairs Fe-S cluster formation. Consequently, proteins affected by the presence of Fe-S clusters, including those involved in energy production and glycine breakdown, cannot function normally. Reduced activity of complex I, II, or III, pyruvate dehydrogenase, or alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase leads to potentially fatal lactic acidosis, encephalopathy, and other signs and symptoms of multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome. In some affected individuals, impairment of the glycine cleavage system leads to a buildup of glycine (hyperglycinemia). "
BRAF ,"B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase","The BRAF gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps transmit chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. This protein is part of a signaling pathway known as the RAS/MAPK pathway, which controls several important cell functions. Specifically, the RAS/MAPK pathway regulates the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (migration), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). Chemical signaling through this pathway is essential for normal development before birth.The BRAF gene belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous.","Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome Mutations in the BRAF gene are the most common cause of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. This condition affects many parts of the body, particularly the heart (cardio-), facial features (facio-), and the skin and hair (cutaneous). At least 49 BRAF mutations have been identified in people with this disorder. These mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the BRAF protein. Almost all of these genetic changes abnormally activate the protein, which disrupts the tightly regulated RAS/MAPK signaling pathway in cells throughout the body. The altered signaling interferes with the normal development of many organs and tissues, resulting in the characteristic features of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. "
BRCA1 ,"BRCA1, DNA repair associated","The BRCA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that acts as a tumor suppressor. Tumor suppressor proteins help prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.The BRCA1 protein is involved in repairing damaged DNA. In the nucleus of many types of normal cells, the BRCA1 protein interacts with several other proteins to mend breaks in DNA. These breaks can be caused by natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, and they also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material in preparation for cell division. By helping to repair DNA, the BRCA1 protein plays a critical role in maintaining the stability of a cell's genetic information.Research suggests that the BRCA1 protein also regulates the activity of other genes and plays an essential role in embryonic development. To carry out these functions, the BRCA1 protein interacts with many other proteins, including other tumor suppressors and proteins that regulate cell division.","Breast cancer Researchers have identified more than 1,800 mutations in the BRCA1 gene. Many of these mutations are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in both men and women, as well as several other types of cancer. These mutations are present in every cell in the body and can be passed from one generation to the next. As a result, they are associated with cancers that cluster in families. However, not everyone who inherits a mutation in the BRCA1 gene will develop cancer. Other genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors also contribute to a person's cancer risk.Most BRCA1 gene mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the BRCA1 protein or prevent any protein from being made from one copy of the gene. As a result, less of this protein is available to help repair damaged DNA or fix mutations that occur in other genes. As these defects accumulate, they can trigger cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. "
BRCA2 ,"BRCA2, DNA repair associated","The BRCA2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that acts as a tumor suppressor. Tumor suppressor proteins help prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.The BRCA2 protein is involved in repairing damaged DNA. In the nucleus of many types of normal cells, the BRCA2 protein interacts with several other proteins to mend breaks in DNA. These breaks can be caused by natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, and they also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material in preparation for cell division. By helping to repair DNA, the BRCA2 protein plays a critical role in maintaining the stability of a cell's genetic information.Researchers suspect that the BRCA2 protein has additional functions within cells. For example, the protein may help regulate cytokinesis, which is the step in cell division when the fluid surrounding the nucleus (the cytoplasm) divides to form two separate cells. Researchers are investigating the protein's other potential activities.","Breast cancer Researchers have identified more than 1,800 mutations in the BRCA2 gene.

As these defects accumulate, they can trigger cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. "
BSCL2 ,"BSCL2, seipin lipid droplet biogenesis associated","The BSCL2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called seipin, whose function is unknown. Within cells, seipin is located in the membrane of a structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum modifies newly produced proteins and also helps transport proteins, fats, and other molecules to specific sites either inside or outside the cell.The BSCL2 gene is active in cells and tissues throughout the body, particularly in nerve cells that control muscle movement (motor neurons) and in the brain. The gene is also active in fat-storing cells called adipocytes, which are the major component of fatty (adipose) tissue. Studies suggest that seipin plays a critical role in the development and function of adipocytes. In particular, seipin is involved in the development of lipid droplets, which are structures within these cells that store fat molecules.",Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Genetics Home Reference provides information about Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. 
BSND ,barttin CLCNK type accessory beta subunit,"The BSND gene provides instructions for making a protein called barttin. This protein is found primarily in the kidneys, where it attaches (binds) to two specific chloride channels: ClC-Ka (produced from the CLCNKA gene) and ClC-Kb (produced from the CLCNKB gene). The ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb channels transport charged atoms of chlorine (chloride ions) out of kidney cells.Barttin is essential for the normal placement of ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb channels in the cell membrane. It also regulates the channels' stability and function. The transport of chloride ions is part of the mechanism by which the kidneys reabsorb salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) from the urine back into the bloodstream. The retention of salt affects the body's fluid levels and helps maintain blood pressure.Barttin, ClC-Ka, and ClC-Kb are also found in the inner ear, where they play a role in normal hearing.","Bartter syndrome More than a dozen mutations in the BSND gene have been identified in people with Bartter syndrome type IV. This form of the disorder causes severe or life-threatening health problems that become apparent before or soon after birth. Affected individuals also have hearing loss caused by abnormalities in the inner ear, which is why Bartter syndrome type IV is also known as antenatal Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness.BSND gene mutations impair barttin's ability to regulate the ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb channels. Some mutations keep the channels from ever reaching the cell membrane. Other mutations allow the channels to reach the cell membrane but prevent them from transporting ions properly. As a result, the kidneys cannot reabsorb salt normally and excess salt is lost through the urine (salt wasting). The abnormal salt loss disrupts the normal balance of ions in the body. This imbalance underlies many of the major features of Bartter syndrome, including a failure to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive), dehydration, constipation, and increased urine production (polyuria). A loss of ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb function in the inner ear is responsible for the hearing loss characteristic of Bartter syndrome type IV. "
BTD ,biotinidase,"The BTD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called biotinidase. This enzyme recycles biotin, a B vitamin found in foods such as liver, egg yolks, and milk. Biotinidase removes biotin that is bound to proteins in food, leaving the vitamin in its free (unbound) state. The body needs free biotin to activate enzymes called biotin-dependent carboxylases. These carboxylases are involved in many critical cellular functions, including the breakdown of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.In addition to processing biotin obtained from the diet, biotinidase recycles biotin within the body. As biotin-dependent carboxylases are broken down, they release a molecule called biocytin. Biocytin is a complex made of up biotin and a protein building block (amino acid) called lysine. Biotinidase splits this complex, making free biotin available for reuse by other carboxylase enzymes.Researchers suspect that biotinidase may have several additional functions. This enzyme may transport free biotin through the bloodstream. It might also have the ability to attach biotin to certain proteins through a process called biotinylation. Within the nucleus, biotinylation of DNA-associated proteins called histones may help determine whether certain genes are turned on or off. It is unclear, however, whether biotinidase plays a role in regulating gene activity.","Biotinidase deficiency More than 150 mutations in the BTD gene have been identified in people with biotinidase deficiency. This disorder, if untreated, can affect many parts of the body and cause delayed development. Most of the mutations that cause biotinidase deficiency change single amino acids in the biotinidase enzyme. These changes occur in critical regions of the enzyme and reduce or eliminate the enzyme's activity.Most BTD gene mutations cause profound biotinidase deficiency. This severe form of the disorder results when the activity of biotinidase is reduced to less than 10 percent of normal. Other mutations cause a milder form of the condition called partial biotinidase deficiency. These mutations reduce biotinidase activity to between 10 percent and 30 percent of normal. Without enough of this enzyme, biotin cannot be recycled. The resulting shortage of free biotin impairs the activity of biotin-dependent carboxylases, leading to a buildup of potentially toxic compounds in the body. If the condition is not treated promptly, this buildup damages various cells and tissues, causing the signs and symptoms associated with biotinidase deficiency. "
BTK ,Bruton tyrosine kinase,"The BTK gene provides instructions for making a protein called Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), which is essential for the development and maturation of B cells. B cells are specialized white blood cells that help protect the body against infection. These cells can mature into cells that produce special proteins called antibodies or immunoglobulins. Antibodies attach to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction. The BTK protein transmits important chemical signals that instruct B cells to mature and produce antibodies.","Isolated growth hormone deficiency A few mutations in the BTK gene have been found to cause isolated growth hormone deficiency type III, a condition characterized by slow growth, short stature, and a weakened immune system. Mutations that cause this condition lead to production of a nonfunctional version of the BTK protein. People with isolated growth hormone deficiency are prone to infections because they produce very few B cells and have a shortage of antibodies (agammaglobulinemia). A lack of the BTK protein is likely responsible for the immune system symptoms, but how a shortage of BTK protein causes short stature in affected individuals is unclear. "
BUB1B ,BUB1 mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase B,"The BUB1B gene provides instructions for making a protein called BUBR1, which is important for proper chromosome separation during cell division. Before cells divide, they must copy all of their chromosomes. The copied DNA from each chromosome is arranged into two identical structures, called sister chromatids, which are attached to one another during the early stages of cell division. The sets of chromosomes align within the cell, with each chromatid attached to a structure called a spindle microtubule; when all chromatids are correctly attached, the spindle microtubule pulls the two halves of the chromatid pair to opposite sides of the cell. The cell then divides in two such that each new cell contains one complete set of chromosomes.The BUBR1 protein helps ensure that each sister chromatid is attached to a spindle microtubule. If any chromatids remain unattached, the protein prevents cell division.","Mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome More than a dozen mutations in the BUB1B gene have been found to cause mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA) syndrome type 1. This condition is characterized by cells with abnormal numbers of chromosomes, a situation known as aneuploidy. Affected individuals grow slowly and have an unusually small head size (microcephaly) and an increased risk of developing cancer in childhood.MVA syndrome type 1 occurs when both copies of the BUB1B gene have mutations. These mutations reduce the amount of BUBR1 protein in cells or impair the protein's ability to function. A shortage of functioning BUBR1 protein leads to errors in the distribution of chromatids during cell division. Without BUBR1 protein, cell division can proceed, even if all the chromatids are not attached to spindle microtubules. Unattached chromatids are not positioned correctly for separation, and the resulting cells have abnormal numbers of chromosomes.Research suggests that impairment of the process that delays cell division until the correct time underlies the increased risk of cancer in MVA syndrome, although the mechanism is not completely understood. It is also unclear how BUB1B gene mutations or aneuploidy leads to the other features of MVA syndrome. Researchers speculate that the abnormal cells undergo self-destruction (apoptosis). The signs and symptoms of MVA syndrome may be due to the loss of cells from various tissues during early development. "
C2 ,complement C2,"The C2 gene provides instructions for making the complement component 2 protein. This protein helps regulate a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (such as bacteria and viruses), trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. When a foreign invader is detected, the complement pathway is turned on (activated) and the complement component 2 protein attaches (binds) to a similar protein called complement component 4. Together, these proteins form a complex called C3 convertase, which triggers further activation of the pathway, allowing the proteins of the complement system to participate in an immune response.","Complement component 2 deficiency At least five mutations in the C2 gene have been found to cause complement component 2 deficiency. This disorder reduces the normal function of the immune system, resulting in an increased risk for infections and autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's tissues and organs.More than 90 percent of people with complement component 2 deficiency have a mutation that deletes 28 DNA building blocks (nucleotides) from the C2 gene. This mutation prevents the production of any complement component 2 protein. Without this protein to form C3 convertase, activation of the complement system is stalled. As a result, the complement system's ability to fight infections is diminished. It is unclear how complement component 2 deficiency leads to increased susceptibility to autoimmune disorders. Researchers speculate that the dysfunctional complement system is unable to distinguish what it should attack, and it sometimes attacks normal tissues, leading to autoimmunity. Alternatively, the dysfunctional complement system may perform partial attacks on invading molecules, which leaves behind foreign fragments that are difficult to distinguish from the body's tissues, so the complement system sometimes attacks the body's own cells. It is likely that other factors, both genetic and environmental, play a role in the variability of the signs and symptoms of complement component 2 deficiency. "
C3 ,complement C3,"The C3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called complement component 3 (or C3). This protein plays a key role in a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (such as bacteria and viruses), trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues.The C3 protein is essential for turning on (activating) the complement system. The presence of foreign invaders triggers the C3 protein to be cut (cleaved) into two smaller pieces. One of these pieces, called C3b, interacts with several other proteins on the surface of cells to trigger the complement system's response. This process must be carefully regulated so the complement system targets only unwanted materials and does not damage the body's healthy cells.Researchers have identified two major forms (allotypes) of the C3 protein, which are known as C3S and C3F. In the general population, C3S is more common than C3F. The two allotypes differ by a single protein building block (amino acid), although it is unclear whether they function differently.","C3 glomerulopathy At least one mutation in the C3 gene has been found to cause a rare form of kidney disease called C3 glomerulopathy. This disorder damages the kidneys and can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a life-threatening condition that prevents the kidneys from filtering fluids and waste products from the body effectively.The identified C3 gene mutation deletes two amino acids from the C3 protein. This genetic change is described as a ""gain-of-function"" mutation because it leads to an altered version of the protein that overactivates the complement system. The overactive system damages structures in the kidneys called glomeruli, which are clusters of tiny blood vessels that help filter waste products from the blood. Damage to glomeruli prevents the kidneys from filtering waste products normally and can lead to ESRD.Several other changes in the C3 gene do not cause C3 glomerulopathy directly but appear to increase the likelihood of developing the disorder. In particular, the C3F allotype is seen more frequently in people with this condition than in the general population. Researchers are working to determine how the C3F allotype may influence disease risk. "
C8A ,complement C8 alpha chain,"The C8A gene provides instructions for making one piece, the alpha subunit, of a protein complex called complement component 8. The alpha subunit is linked to another piece of the complex called the gamma subunit (produced from the C8G gene). These two proteins interact with the beta subunit (produced from the C8B gene) to form complement component 8.Complement component 8 aids in a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders, trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. Complement component 8 combines with several other complement proteins to form the membrane attack complex (MAC), which inserts itself in the outer membrane of bacterial cells. This complex creates a hole (pore) in the membrane, which kills the bacterium. This part of the immune response appears to be especially important for fighting infection by bacteria in the Neisseria genus.","Complement component 8 deficiency At least two mutations in the C8A gene have been found to cause complement component 8 deficiency type I. This condition is an immune system disorder, known as an immunodeficiency, in which the immune system is not able to protect the body effectively from foreign invaders such as bacteria. People with complement component 8 deficiency have a significantly increased risk of developing recurrent infections, particularly by Neisseria meningitidis, which causes meningitis, a serious condition that involves inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.Mutations in the C8A gene alter the blueprint for protein production; if produced, the abnormally short alpha subunit is likely broken down quickly. The resulting shortage of this protein impairs formation of complement component 8. Deficiency of this component prevents formation of membrane attack complexes. Without this part of the immune response, affected individuals are prone to infection, particularly by Neisseria bacteria. "
C8B ,complement C8 beta chain,"The C8B gene provides instructions for making one piece, the beta subunit, of a protein complex called complement component 8. To form this complex, the beta subunit interacts with another piece made up of the alpha subunit (produced from the C8A gene) and the gamma subunit (produced from the C8G gene), which are linked.Complement component 8 aids in a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders, trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. Complement component 8 combines with several other complement proteins to form the membrane attack complex (MAC), which inserts itself in the outer membrane of bacterial cells. This complex creates a hole (pore) in the membrane, which kills the bacterium. This part of the immune response appears to be especially important for fighting infection by bacteria in the Neisseria genus.","Complement component 8 deficiency Several mutations in the C8B gene cause complement component 8 deficiency type II. This condition is an immune system disorder, known as an immunodeficiency, in which the immune system is not able to protect the body effectively from foreign invaders such as bacteria. People with complement component 8 deficiency have a significantly increased risk of developing recurrent infections, particularly by Neisseria meningitidis, which causes meningitis, a serious condition that involves inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.C8B gene mutations involved in complement component 8 deficiency are most often of a type called a C to T transition, in which a DNA building block (nucleotide) called cytosine (C) is changed to the nucleotide thymine (T). Most commonly, this change occurs in a region of the gene called exon 9, but it can occur in other regions. These mutations alter the sequence of protein building blocks, resulting in an abnormally short protein that, if produced, is likely broken down quickly. Other types of mutations can occur in the C8B gene; they also lead to an abnormally short protein that is quickly broken down. The resulting shortage of this protein impairs formation of complement component 8. Deficiency of this component prevents formation of membrane attack complexes. Without this part of the immune response, affected individuals are prone to infection, particularly by Neisseria bacteria. "
C9orf72 ,chromosome 9 open reading frame 72,"The C9orf72 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in various tissues. The protein is abundant in nerve cells (neurons) in the outer layers of the brain (cerebral cortex) and in specialized neurons in the brain and spinal cord that control movement (motor neurons). The C9orf72 protein is thought to be located at the tip of the neuron in a region called the presynaptic terminal. This area is important for sending and receiving signals between neurons.The C9orf72 protein likely plays a role in many processes involving the chemical cousin of DNA, known as RNA. This protein is thought to influence the production of RNA from genes, the production of proteins from RNA, and the transport of RNA within the cell.The C9orf72 gene contains a segment of DNA made up of a series of six DNA building blocks (nucleotides), four guanines followed by two cytosines (written as GGGGCC). This segment (known as a hexanucleotide repeat) can occur once or be repeated multiple times in a row; estimates suggest repeats of up to 30 times have no negative effect on gene function.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Mutations in the C9orf72 gene have been found to cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a condition characterized by progressive muscle weakness, a loss of muscle mass, and an inability to control movement. These mutations affect the GGGGCC segment of the gene. When this series of nucleotides is repeated too many times, it can cause ALS. This type of mutation is called a hexanucleotide repeat expansion. Although it is not clear exactly how many hexanucleotide repeats are needed to cause disease, researchers believe that having more than about 30 repeats can lead to ALS.It is unclear whether the hexanucleotide repeat expansion reduces C9orf72 protein function or leads to the production of a protein with abnormal function that disrupts RNA and protein production in the cell, resulting in the formation of protein clumps (aggregates). In ALS, the large size of motor neurons is thought to make these cells vulnerable to impairments in normal cell function. Disruptions in C9orf72 protein function may lead to premature motor neuron cell death, resulting in the signs and symptoms of ALS.Some people with ALS caused by C9orf72 gene mutations also develop a condition called frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which is a progressive brain disorder that affects personality, behavior, and language. It is unclear why some people with C9orf72 gene mutations develop FTD and others do not. Individuals who develop both conditions are diagnosed as having ALS-FTD. "
C19orf12 ,chromosome 19 open reading frame 12,"The C19orf12 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. The protein is found in the membrane of cellular structures called mitochondria, which are the cell's energy-producing centers. Researchers suggest that the C19orf12 protein plays a role in the maintenance of fat (lipid) molecules, a process known as lipid homeostasis.","Mitochondrial membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration At least 28 mutations in the C19orf12 gene have been found to cause a condition known as mitochondrial membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration (MPAN), which is characterized by movement and neurological problems that gradually worsen. Affected individuals also have an abnormal accumulation of iron in certain regions of the brain. The gene mutations that cause this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the C19orf12 protein or lead to an abnormally short protein. These changes likely reduce or eliminate the function of the protein. One C19orf12 gene mutation, which deletes 11 DNA building blocks (nucleotides) from the gene, is found in people of Polish descent who have the condition. This genetic change leads to production of an abnormally short protein, which is quickly broken down. It is unclear how loss of C19orf12 protein function leads to the signs and symptoms of MPAN. Researchers are working to determine whether there is a link between problems with lipid homeostasis and brain iron accumulation or how these abnormalities might contribute to the features of this disorder.C19orf12 gene mutations can cause a spectrum of related conditions with some but not all of the characteristic features of MPAN. For example, some affected individuals have movement problems such as muscle stiffness (spasticity) but not iron accumulation in the brain; these individuals are considered to have a condition called hereditary spastic paraplegia type 43. "
CA5A ,carbonic anhydrase 5A,"The CA5A gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase VA. This enzyme helps convert carbon dioxide to a substance called bicarbonate. Bicarbonate is necessary to maintain the proper acid-base balance in the body, which is necessary for most biological reactions to proceed properly.The carbonic anhydrase VA enzyme is particularly important in the liver, where it provides bicarbonate needed by four enzymes in the energy-producing centers of cells (mitochondria): carbomoyl phosphate synthetase-1, pyruvate carboxylase, propionyl-CoA carboxylase, and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase. These enzymes help control the amount of certain other substances in the body. Carbomoyl phosphate synthetase-1 is involved in the urea cycle, which processes excess nitrogen and prevents it from accumulating as ammonia, a substance that is toxic to the brain. Pyruvate carboxylase is involved in the production of the simple sugar glucose (gluconeogenesis) in the liver. Propionyl-CoA carboxylase and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase help break down certain protein building blocks (amino acids).","Carbonic anhydrase VA deficiency At least three CA5A gene mutations have been identified in people with carbonic anhydrase VA deficiency. This inherited disorder is characterized by potentially life-threatening episodes of poor feeding, vomiting, weight loss, tiredness (lethargy), rapid breathing (tachypnea), seizures, or coma. The risk of these episodes is thought to decline after childhood.Mutations in the CA5A gene result in absent or impaired carbonic anhydrase VA enzyme function, leading to reduced bicarbonate production. Insufficient bicarbonate results in impaired control of acid-base balance and reduces the activity of the four affected mitochondrial enzymes, leading to various biochemical abnormalities that are associated with carbonic anhydrase VA deficiency and that cause the episodes that occur in this disorder. Studies suggest that a related enzyme produced from the CA5B gene may increasingly compensate for the lack of carbonic anhydrase VA as affected individuals mature, which may result in a reduced risk of disease episodes after childhood. "
CA12 ,carbonic anhydrase 12,"The CA12 gene provides instructions for making a protein called carbonic anhydrase 12 (CA 12), which belongs to a family of proteins known as carbonic anhydrases. These proteins carry out a chemical reaction that involves the molecules carbon dioxide and water and produces a negatively charged bicarbonate molecule (bicarbonate ion) and a positively charged hydrogen atom (known as a proton). Carbonic anhydrases can also carry out the reverse reaction, forming carbon dioxide and water from bicarbonate. Carbon dioxide, bicarbonate, and protons are involved in many functions in the body; by regulating the levels of these substances, carbonic anhydrases play roles in several important processes. The presence of protons and bicarbonate affect the relative acidity (pH) of cells; one function of some carbonic anhydrases is to help maintain the correct cellular pH.CA 12 is found in several tissues, including the sweat glands, kidneys, and large intestine. The protein likely helps regulate the transport of salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) in these tissues. Researchers suggest that channels that move salt in and out of cells are controlled in part by the pH of the cells. By regulating cellular pH, CA 12 may be able to control salt transport. In sweat glands, CA 12 is thought to play a role in determining how much salt is released from the body in sweat.","Isolated hyperchlorhidrosis At least one mutation in the CA12 gene causes isolated hyperchlorhidrosis, a condition characterized by abnormally high levels of salt in sweat that can lead to dehydration associated with low levels of sodium in the blood (hyponatremic dehydration). The gene mutation that causes this condition changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the CA 12 protein, replacing the amino acid glutamate at position 143 with the amino acid lysine (written as Glu143Lys or E143K). The function of the altered protein is reduced to about 70 percent of normal. In addition, the altered protein is more easily turned off (inhibited) than normal, which further reduces protein function. It is thought that the altered CA 12 is less able to regulate pH, and it loses its ability to control how much salt is released in sweat, leading to hyperchlorhidrosis.Researchers suggest that other tissues are seemingly unaffected by CA12 gene mutations because these tissues contain other carbonic anhydrases that compensate for the loss of CA 12 function. "
CACNA1A ,calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 A,"The CACNA1A gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making calcium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) across cell membranes, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. Calcium ions are involved in many different cellular functions, including cell-to-cell communication, the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction), and the regulation of certain genes.The CACNA1A gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha-1 subunit) of a calcium channel called CaV2.1. This subunit forms the hole (pore) through which calcium ions can flow. CaV2.1 channels play an essential role in communication between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. These channels help control the release of neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that relay signals from one neuron to another. Researchers believe that CaV2.1 channels are also involved in the survival of neurons and the ability of these cells to change and adapt over time (plasticity).Near one end of the CACNA1A gene, a segment of three DNA building blocks (nucleotides) is repeated multiple times. This sequence, which is written as CAG, is called a triplet or trinucleotide repeat. In most people, the number of CAG repeats in this gene ranges from 4 to 18.","Episodic ataxia More than 80 mutations in the CACNA1A gene have been found to cause episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), the most common form of episodic ataxia. In addition to problems with coordination and balance (ataxia), EA2 is associated with involuntary eye movements called nystagmus. The CACNA1A mutations responsible for EA2 reduce the production of functional CaV2.1 channels or prevent these channels from reaching the cell membrane, where they are needed to transport calcium ions. A decrease in the number of these channels reduces the total flow of calcium ions into neurons, which disrupts the release of neurotransmitters in the brain. Although changes in signaling between neurons underlie the episodes of uncoordinated movement seen in people with episodic ataxia, it is unclear how altered calcium ion transport causes the specific features of the condition. "
CACNA1C ,calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 C,"The CACNA1C gene provides instructions for making one of several calcium channels. Calcium channels, which transport positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) into cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate electrical signals. Calcium ions are important for many cellular functions, including regulating the electrical activity of cells, cell-to-cell communication, the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction), and the regulation of certain genes, particularly those involved in the development of the brain and bones before birth.The calcium channel produced from the CACNA1C gene is known as CaV1.2. These channels are found in many types of cells, although they appear to be particularly important for the function of heart cells (cardiomyocytes) and nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. In the heart, CaV1.2 channels open and close at specific times to control the flow of calcium ions into cardiomyocytes at each heartbeat. How long the channels are open and closed is regulated to maintain normal heart function. In the brain, CaV1.2 channels are thought to be involved in memory, the fear response, and the rapid transmission of nerve signals; however, the role of these channels in the brain and other tissues is not completely understood.Researchers have discovered that many different versions (isoforms) of the CaV1.2 channel can be produced from the CACNA1C gene by a mechanism called alternative splicing. This mechanism produces different versions of the channel by cutting and rearranging the genetic instructions in different ways. Some versions of the CaV1.2 channel are more common than others in certain parts of the body. For example, in the heart and brain, about 80 percent of CaV1.2 channels are made with a particular segment known as exon 8. The other 20 percent of CaV1.2 channels contain a slightly different version of this segment, known as exon 8A. This difference becomes important when researchers are studying the effects of CACNA1C mutations in various tissues.",Short QT syndrome Genetics Home Reference provides information about short QT syndrome. 
CACNA1D ,calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 D,"The CACNA1D gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making calcium channels. These channels transport positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) across cell membranes. The CACNA1D gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha-1 subunit) of a calcium channel called CaV1.3. This subunit forms the hole (pore) through which calcium ions can flow. CaV1.3 channels are found in many types of cells, although they play a particularly important role in the adrenal glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. In the adrenal glands, the flow of calcium through CaV1.3 channels appears to help regulate the production of the hormone aldosterone, which helps control blood pressure by maintaining proper salt and fluid levels in the body. CaV1.3 channels are also found in the brain, heart, and inner ear, although their roles in these tissues are not well understood.","Aldosterone-producing adenoma Mutations in the CACNA1D gene have been found to cause aldosterone-producing adenomas, which are noncancerous (benign) tumors that form in the adrenal glands. The genetic changes involved in these tumors, called somatic mutations, are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in adrenal gland cells that give rise to the tumors. Such mutations in the CACNA1D gene account for approximately nine percent of cases of aldosterone-producing adenoma.CACNA1D gene mutations associated with this condition lead to production of CaV1.3 channels that transport calcium ions more readily than normal or do not stop when they should. It is thought that the abnormal influx of calcium ions in adrenal gland cells overactivates a process called the calcium/calmodulin pathway that increases production of a hormone called aldosterone. Aldosterone helps control blood pressure by maintaining proper salt and fluid levels in the body, and abnormally high amounts of this hormone lead to high blood pressure (hypertension) and an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Overactivation of the calcium/calmodulin pathway in the adrenal glands also increases cell growth and division (proliferation), which promotes adenoma formation. "
CACNA1F ,calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 F,"The CACNA1F gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making calcium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) across cell membranes, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.The CACNA1F gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha-1 subunit) of a calcium channel called CaV1.4. This subunit forms the hole (pore) in the cell membrane through which calcium ions can flow. CaV1.4 channels are found in many types of cells, although they play a particularly important role in a specialized tissue at the back of the eye called the retina. Within the retina, the channels are located in light-detecting cells called photoreceptors. The retina contains two types of photoreceptors: rods and cones. Rods are responsible for vision in low light. Cones provide vision in bright light, including color vision.CaV1.4 channels appear to play a critical role in normal vision. Studies suggest they help relay visual signals from rods and cones to other retinal cells called bipolar cells. This signaling is an essential step in the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain.","X-linked congenital stationary night blindness More than 70 mutations in the CACNA1F gene have been identified in people with X-linked congenital stationary night blindness. Mutations in this gene are responsible for the incomplete form of the disorder, which is characterized by vision problems including a loss of sharpness (reduced acuity), nearsightedness (myopia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). Many affected individuals also have difficulty seeing in low light (night blindness).CACNA1F mutations change the structure of the alpha-1 subunit, which alters or eliminates the function of CaV1.4 channels. These changes prevent the normal transport of calcium ions across the cell membrane of photoreceptor cells. A loss of calcium ion transport disrupts the ability of both rods and cones to transmit visual signals, which impairs vision. "
CACNA1S ,calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 S,"The CACNA1S gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making calcium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged calcium atoms (ions) into cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.The CACNA1S gene provides instructions for making calcium channels that are abundant in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For the body to move normally, these muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. Muscle contractions are triggered by the flow of certain ions into muscle cells. Channels made with the CACNA1S protein control the transport of calcium ions into muscle cells and are part of the cellular machinery that initiates muscle contractions.Channels made with the CACNA1S protein also activate a protein called ryanodine receptor 1 (produced by the RYR1 gene). Ryanodine receptor 1 forms a channel that releases stored calcium ions within muscle cells in response to certain signals. The resulting increase in calcium ion concentration stimulates muscle fibers to contract, allowing the body to move.","Hypokalemic periodic paralysis At least four mutations in the CACNA1S gene have been identified in people with hypokalemic periodic paralysis. These mutations cause up to 70 percent of all cases of this disorder.Mutations in the CACNA1S gene change single protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make the CACNA1S protein, which alters the structure and function of calcium channels in skeletal muscle cells. The altered channels open more slowly than usual, reducing the flow of calcium ions into these cells. This disruption in calcium ion transport prevents muscles from contracting normally. It is unclear precisely how these changes lead to episodes of muscle weakness in people with hypokalemic periodic paralysis. "
CACNB4 ,calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit beta 4,"The CACNB4 gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making calcium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) into cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. Calcium ions are involved in many different cellular functions, including cell-to-cell communication, the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction), and the regulation of certain genes.Calcium channels are each made up of a large alpha-1 (α1) subunit, which forms the hole (pore) through which calcium ions can flow. Each channel also includes several smaller subunits, which regulate the channel's activity and interact with various proteins inside and outside the cell. The CACNB4 gene provides instructions for making a regulatory subunit called beta-4 (β4). This subunit is most often associated with calcium channels in the brain, particularly the part of the brain that is involved in coordinating movements (the cerebellum).In the brain, calcium channels play an essential role in communication between nerve cells (neurons). These channels help control the release of neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that relay signals from one neuron to another. Researchers believe that calcium channels are also involved in the survival of neurons and the ability of these cells to change and adapt over time (plasticity).","Episodic ataxia Researchers have identified at least one mutation in the CACNB4 gene that is likely to cause episodic ataxia. This mutation, which was found in a French-Canadian family with episodic ataxia type 5 (EA5), changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the calcium channel β4 subunit. Specifically, it replaces the amino acid cysteine with the amino acid phenylalanine at position 104 (written as Cys104Phe or C104F). Scientists speculate that this genetic change may alter the ability of the β4 subunit to interact with other proteins and in some way disrupt the normal function of calcium channels in the brain. It is unclear how these effects may lead to episodes of uncoordinated movement and the other signs and symptoms of episodic ataxia. "
CALR ,calreticulin,"The CALR gene provides instructions for making a multi-functional protein called calreticulin. This protein is found in several parts of the cell, including inside a structure called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in the fluid-filled space inside the cell (the cytoplasm), and at the outer surface of the cell. The ER is involved in protein processing and transport, and within this structure, calreticulin plays a role in ensuring the proper folding of newly formed proteins. The ER is also a storage location for charged calcium atoms (calcium ions), and calreticulin is involved in maintaining the correct levels of calcium ions in this structure. Through calcium regulation and other mechanisms, calreticulin is thought to play a role in the control of gene activity, cell growth and division (proliferation) and movement (migration), the attachment of cells to one another (adhesion), and regulation of programmed cell death (apoptosis). The function of this protein is important for immune system function and wound healing.",19p13.13 deletion syndrome Genetics Home Reference provides information about 19p13.13 deletion syndrome. 
CAPN3 ,calpain 3,"The CAPN3 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called calpain-3, which is found within muscle cells in structures called sarcomeres. Sarcomeres are the basic unit of muscle contraction. They are made of proteins that generate the mechanical force needed for muscles to contract.The function of the calpain-3 enzyme is not well understood. Researchers suggest it may help cut (cleave) damaged proteins into shorter segments to facilitate their removal from the sarcomere. Studies have also shown that calpain-3 attaches (binds) to proteins involved in controlling the ability of muscle fibers to stretch (elasticity) and in cell signaling. However, its specific roles in these processes are unknown.","Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy More than 300 mutations in the CAPN3 gene have been identified in people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A. This form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is also called calpainopathy.Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is a group of related disorders characterized by muscle weakness and wasting, particularly in the shoulders, hips, and limbs. CAPN3 gene mutations are the most common cause of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. These mutations account for approximately 30 percent of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy cases overall, although the percentage varies by specific population.Most CAPN3 gene mutations change one protein building block (amino acid) in the calpain-3 enzyme. These mutations result in a calpain-3 enzyme that is abnormally short or unstable. Disruption of the enzyme's ability to properly cleave proteins for removal from the sarcomere may allow these waste proteins to accumulate in muscle tissue and become toxic. Other mechanisms have also been suggested to account for the muscle damage that underlies limb-girdle muscular dystrophy in people with CAPN3 gene mutations. "
CARD9 ,caspase recruitment domain family member 9,"The CARD9 gene provides instructions for making an immune system protein that is involved in the body's defense against fungal infections and is particularly important for fighting infection by a fungus called Candida. When the immune system recognizes Candida, it generates cells called Th17 cells. These cells produce signaling molecules (cytokines) called the interleukin-17 (IL-17) family as part of an immune process called the IL-17 pathway. The IL-17 pathway creates inflammation, sending other cytokines and white blood cells that fight foreign invaders and promote tissue repair. In addition, the IL-17 pathway promotes the production of certain antimicrobial protein segments (peptides) that control growth of Candida on the surface of mucous membranes.In its role in defending against Candida on the mucous membranes and skin, the CARD9 protein passes along signals from other types of immune system proteins. Each of these proteins recognizes a different component of the Candida cell wall to trigger the production of Th17 cells and launch the immune response.In addition to its role in protecting mucous membranes from fungal infection, the CARD9 protein is also important in recruiting neutrophils (immune cells that have strong anti-fungal activity) from the blood to protect the brain and other organs from fungal infection.","Familial candidiasis At least 15 CARD9 gene mutations have been identified in people with familial candidiasis, an inherited tendency to develop infections caused by the Candida fungus (commonly called yeast infections). Most people with familial candidiasis have chronic yeast infections of the skin, nails, and mucous membranes. This pattern of signs and symptoms, which is called chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, typically begins in early childhood. People with familial candidiasis caused by CARD9 gene mutations can also develop systemic candidiasis, a potentially life-threatening condition in which Candida invades the blood and vital organs, especially the brain. Infections caused by additional types of fungi have also been identified in some people with this form of the disorder, which is sometimes called CARD9 deficiency.Mutations in the CARD9 gene impair multiple signaling pathways that normally help recognize Candida and are thought to block (inhibit) the activity of the IL-17 pathway. Impairment of this pathway diminishes the body's immune response to Candida, leading to the chronic or recurrent yeast infections that occur in people with familial candidiasis. The mutations are also thought to impair the recruitment of neutrophils to fight Candida infection in the brain and other organs, which can lead to systemic candidiasis. "
CARD11 ,caspase recruitment domain family member 11,"The CARD11 gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in the function of immune system cells called lymphocytes, particularly certain types called T cells and B cells. These cells identify foreign substances such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi and defend the body against infection. When T or B cells recognize a foreign substance, the CARD11 protein is turned on (activated) and attaches (binds) to two other proteins, BCL10 and MALT1, to form the CBM signalosome complex. This complex in turn activates other protein complexes called nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB) and mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), which are important for cellular signaling. NF-κB and mTORC1 signaling direct the development and function of T and B cells so they can support an immune response against foreign invaders.","Atopic dermatitis At least five CARD11 gene mutations have been identified in people with a skin disorder called atopic dermatitis (also known as atopic eczema). This condition is characterized by dry, itchy skin and red rashes. The word ""atopic"" indicates an association with allergies. While atopic dermatitis is not always due to an allergic reaction, it is commonly associated with other allergic disorders. People with atopic dermatitis caused by CARD11 gene mutations often have additional allergic disorders, such as asthma and environmental (such as pollen) or food allergies. Many of these individuals also have recurrent infections due to problems with the immune system (immunodeficiency).Atopic dermatitis is generally thought of as a complex condition that is influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors, which each contribute only a small amount to the overall risk of developing the condition. However, CARD11 gene mutations appear to cause atopic dermatitis without other factors. These mutations likely account for only a small percentage of cases of the condition.A mutation in one of the two copies of the CARD11 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause atopic dermatitis. These mutations result in the production of an altered protein that does not function normally. The altered protein produced from the mutated copy of the gene interferes with the normal protein produced from the non-mutated copy of the gene (such mutations are described as ""dominant-negative""), so the amount of functioning CARD11 protein in cells is reduced. These genetic changes are thought to prevent formation of the CBM signalosome complex, impairing signaling by NF-κB and mTORC1. Without these signals, T cells do not develop or function properly. The number of these cells is normal, but their response to foreign invaders is diminished, leading to recurrent infections.It is not clear how the immune dysfunction caused by CARD11 gene mutations leads to atopic dermatitis and allergic disorders. Atopic dermatitis is not initially caused by an allergic reaction, although sometimes substances that can cause allergic reactions (allergens) are thought to contribute to flare-ups of the rashes. "
CARD14 ,caspase recruitment domain family member 14,"The CARD14 gene provides instructions for making a protein that turns on (activates) a group of interacting proteins known as nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB). The NF-κB protein complex regulates the activity of multiple genes, including genes that control the body's immune responses and inflammatory reactions. Inflammation is a normal immune system response to injury and foreign invaders (such as bacteria). The NF-κB protein complex also protects cells from certain signals that would otherwise cause them to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis).The CARD14 protein is found in many of the body's tissues, but it is particularly abundant in the skin. NF-κB signaling appears to play important roles in regulating inflammatory reactions in the skin and in promoting the survival of skin cells.","Familial pityriasis rubra pilaris At least three mutations in the CARD14 gene have been identified in people with familial pityriasis rubra pilaris, a rare hereditary skin condition characterized by a patchy, salmon-colored skin rash covered in fine scales. These mutations lead to overactivation of NF-κB signaling, which triggers an abnormal inflammatory response in the skin. Researchers are working to determine how these changes lead to the specific features of familial pityriasis rubra pilaris. "
CASK ,calcium/calmodulin dependent serine protein kinase,"The CASK gene provides instructions for making a protein called calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK). The CASK protein is primarily found in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain, where it helps control the activity (expression) of other genes that are involved in brain development. It also helps regulate the movement of chemicals called neurotransmitters and of charged atoms (ions), which are necessary for signaling between neurons. Research suggests that the CASK protein may also interact with the protein produced from another gene, FRMD7, to promote development of the nerves that control eye movement (the oculomotor neural network).","CASK-related intellectual disability More than 35 CASK gene mutations have been identified in people with CASK-related intellectual disability. This disorder affects brain development and has two main forms: a severe form called microcephaly with pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia (MICPCH), and a milder form called X-linked intellectual disability (XL-ID) with or without nystagmus.The mutations that cause CASK-related intellectual disability affect the role of the CASK protein in brain development and function. MICPCH is caused by mutations that eliminate CASK function, while mutations that impair the function of this protein cause XL-ID with or without nystagmus. Nystagmus refers to rapid, involuntary back-and-forth eye movements. Affected individuals with nystagmus may have CASK gene mutations that disrupt the interaction between the CASK protein and the protein produced from the FRMD7 gene, leading to problems with the development of the oculomotor neural network and resulting in abnormal eye movements. "
CASQ2 ,calsequestrin 2,"The CASQ2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called calsequestrin 2. This protein is found in heart (cardiac) muscle cells called myocytes, where it is involved in the storage and transport of positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions).Within myocytes, calsequestrin 2 is located in a cell structure called the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which acts as a storage center for calcium ions. Most of these ions are stored by attaching (binding) to calsequestrin 2. This protein also helps regulate a protein called the RYR2 channel, which controls the flow of calcium ions out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.For the heart to beat normally, the cardiac muscle must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. This cycle of muscle contraction and relaxation results from the precise control of calcium ions within myocytes. In response to certain signals, calcium ions stored by calsequestrin 2 in the sarcoplasmic reticulum are released into the surrounding cell fluid (the cytoplasm). The resulting increase in calcium ion concentration triggers the cardiac muscle to contract, which pumps blood out of the heart. Calcium ions are then transported back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and the cardiac muscle relaxes. In this way, the release and reuptake of calcium ions in myocytes produces a regular heart rhythm.","Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia At least seven mutations in the CASQ2 gene have been identified in people with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). Some of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the calsequestrin 2 protein, while other mutations prevent the cell from producing any functional calsequestrin 2. Studies suggest that the altered or missing protein is unable to perform its usual roles in calcium binding within myocytes. A lack of properly functioning calsequestrin 2 may also affect regulation of the RYR2 channel, allowing calcium ions to ""leak"" out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. These changes disrupt the careful control of calcium ion flow within myocytes, which can trigger an abnormal heart rhythm in people with CPVT. "
CASR ,calcium sensing receptor,"The CASR gene provides instructions for making a protein called the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). Calcium molecules attach (bind) to CaSR, which allows this protein to monitor and regulate the amount of calcium in the blood. The receptor is turned on (activated) when a certain concentration of calcium is reached, and the activated receptor sends signals to block processes that increase the amount of calcium in the blood.The CaSR protein is found in abundance in cells of the parathyroid glands. The parathyroid glands produce and release a hormone called parathyroid hormone that works to increase the levels of calcium in the blood. When large amounts of calcium bind to CaSR in the parathyroid glands, the production of parathyroid hormone is blocked, which prevents the release of more calcium into the blood. CaSR signaling also blocks the growth and division (proliferation) of cells that make up the parathyroid glands.The CaSR protein is also found in kidney cells. Kidneys filter fluid and waste products in the body and can reabsorb needed nutrients and release them back into the blood. Increased calcium binding to CaSR in kidney cells blocks the reabsorption of calcium from the filtered fluids.","Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia Mutations in the CASR gene can cause a condition called autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1, which is characterized by low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia). Some affected individuals also have a shortage of parathyroid hormone (hypoparathyroidism).Most CASR gene mutations involved in this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the CaSR protein. The changes (called activating mutations) lead to an overactive CaSR that is more sensitive to calcium, meaning even low levels of calcium can trigger signaling. The overactive CaSR blocks the release of parathyroid hormone, which prevents the release of calcium into the blood. In addition, the overactive CaSR prevents reabsorption of calcium from the fluids filtered through the kidneys. Hypocalcemia can cause muscle cramping and seizures, although about half of people with this condition have no associated health problems. "
CAT ,catalase,"The CAT gene provides instructions for making pieces (subunits) of an enzyme called catalase. Four identical subunits, each attached (bound) to an iron-containing molecule called a heme group, form the functional enzyme.Catalase is active in cells and tissues throughout the body, where it breaks down hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) molecules into oxygen (O2) and water (H2O). Hydrogen peroxide is produced through chemical reactions within cells. At low levels, it is involved in several chemical signaling pathways, but at high levels it is toxic to cells. If hydrogen peroxide is not broken down by catalase, additional reactions convert it into compounds called reactive oxygen species that can damage DNA, proteins, and cell membranes.","Acatalasemia At least 13 mutations in the CAT gene have been found to cause acatalasemia, a condition characterized by very low catalase activity. Many people with acatalasemia never have any related health problems, although the condition has occasionally been associated with open sores (ulcers) inside the mouth leading to the death of soft tissue (gangrene). Acatalasemia also appears to increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (the most common form of diabetes) and is a potential risk factor for other common, complex diseases.The mutations that cause acatalasemia occur in both copies of the CAT gene in each cell, and they reduce the activity of catalase to less than 10 percent of normal. A shortage of this enzyme can allow hydrogen peroxide to build up to toxic levels in certain cells. For example, hydrogen peroxide produced by bacteria in the mouth may accumulate in and damage soft tissues, leading to mouth ulcers and gangrene. A buildup of hydrogen peroxide may also damage beta cells of the pancreas, which release a hormone called insulin that helps control blood sugar. Malfunctioning beta cells are thought to underlie the increased risk of type 2 diabetes in people with acatalasemia. It is unclear why some people have no health problems associated with a shortage of catalase activity.A related condition called hypocatalasemia occurs when only one of the two copies of the CAT gene in each cell has a mutation. This single mutation reduces the activity of catalase by approximately half. Like acatalasemia, hypocatalasemia usually does not cause any health problems. "
CATSPER1 ,cation channel sperm associated 1,"The CATSPER1 gene provides instructions for producing a protein that is found in the tail (flagellum) of sperm cells. The CATSPER1 protein plays a role in sperm cell movement (motility) and is required for sperm cells to push through the outside membrane of the egg cell during fertilization. The CATSPER1 protein is embedded in the membrane of sperm cells and is necessary for positively charged calcium atoms (calcium cations) to enter the cell. Calcium cations are required for a type of sperm motility called hyperactivation. Hyperactivation is characterized by vigorous movements of the sperm tail, which are necessary for the sperm to push through the membrane of the egg cell during fertilization.","CATSPER1-related nonsyndromic male infertility At least two mutations in the CATSPER1 gene have been found to cause CATSPER1-related nonsyndromic male infertility. These mutations are thought to lead to the production of a CATSPER1 protein that may be altered, nonfunctional, or quickly broken down (degraded) by the cell. A lack of functional CATSPER1 protein impairs calcium entry into the sperm cell, which decreases motility and prevents hyperactivation. Lack of hyperactivation results in sperm that are unable to push through the membrane of the egg cell and achieve fertilization. These sperm abnormalities are the cause of infertility in affected males. Male infertility is the only symptom of CATSPER1-related nonsyndromic male infertility. "
CATSPER2 ,cation channel sperm associated 2,"The CATSPER2 gene provides instructions for producing a protein that is found in the tail (flagellum) of sperm cells. The CATSPER2 protein plays a role in sperm cell movement (motility) and is required for sperm cells to push through the outside membrane of the egg cell during fertilization. The CATSPER2 protein is embedded in the membrane of the sperm tail and is necessary in order for positively charged calcium atoms (calcium cations) to enter the cell. Calcium cations are needed for a type of sperm motility called hyperactivation. Hyperactivation is characterized by vigorous movements of the sperm tail, which are required for the sperm to push through the membrane of the egg cell during fertilization.","Sensorineural deafness and male infertility The symptoms of sensorineural deafness and male infertility are caused by a deletion of genetic material on the long (q) arm of chromosome 15. The chromosomal region that is typically deleted contains multiple genes, including the CATSPER2 gene. People with this condition have the deletion in both copies of chromosome 15 in each cell. As a result of the deletion, affected individuals are missing both copies of the CATSPER2 gene, and no CATSPER2 protein is produced. A lack of CATSPER2 protein impairs calcium entry into the sperm cell, which decreases motility and prevents hyperactivation. Lack of hyperactivation results in sperm that are unable to push through the membrane of the egg cell and achieve fertilization. These sperm abnormalities are the cause of infertility in affected males. "
CAV1 ,caveolin 1,"The CAV1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called caveolin-1. This protein appears to have diverse functions in cells and tissues throughout the body.Caveolin-1 is the major component of caveolae, which are small pouches in the membrane that surrounds cells. Caveolae have multiple functions, some of which are not well understood. They are known to be involved in the transport of molecules from the cell membrane to the interior of the cell (endocytosis), processing of molecules on their way into the cell, maintaining the cell structure, and regulating chemical signaling pathways. Studies suggest that caveolae are particularly numerous in adipocytes, which are cells that store fats for energy. Adipocytes make up most of the body's fatty (adipose) tissue. In these cells, caveolae appear to be essential for the normal transport, processing, and storage of fats.Caveolin-1 is also found in many other parts of cells, where it regulates various chemical signaling pathways. Through these pathways, caveolin-1 is involved in regulating cell growth and division (proliferation), the process by which cells mature to perform specific functions (differentiation), cell survival and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis), and cell movement. The functions of caveolin-1 likely differ depending on the type of cell and the part of the cell where the protein is found.","Congenital generalized lipodystrophy At least one mutation in the CAV1 gene has been found to cause congenital generalized lipodystrophy (also called Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy) type 3. This rare condition is characterized by an almost total absence of adipose tissue and a very muscular appearance. A shortage of adipose tissue leads to multiple health problems, including high levels of fats called triglycerides circulating in the bloodstream (hypertriglyceridemia) and diabetes mellitus. Additional features of congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 3 include poor growth and short stature.The identified mutation replaces a single protein building block (amino acid) with a premature stop signal at position 38 of the caveolin-1 protein (written as Glu38Ter or E38X.) This mutation occurs in both copies of the CAV1 gene in each cell, and it prevents cells from producing any functional caveolin-1. It is unclear how a lack of this protein leads to the particular features of congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 3. However, the absence of caveolin-1 likely disrupts the normal development and function of adipocytes, which would prevent fats from being stored normally in adipose tissue. A lack of body fat underlies many of the signs and symptoms of this condition. "
CAV3 ,caveolin 3,"The CAV3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called caveolin-3, which is found in the membrane surrounding muscle cells. This protein is the main component of caveolae, which are small pouches in the muscle cell membrane. Within the caveolae, the caveolin-3 protein acts as a scaffold to organize other molecules that are important for cell signaling and maintenance of the cell structure. These molecules include the proteins that make up sodium channels, which transport positively charged sodium atoms (sodium ions) into cells. Sodium channels play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. In cardiac muscle, sodium channels are involved in maintaining the heart's normal rhythm. Caveolin-3 may also help regulate calcium levels in the muscle cell, which control muscle contraction and relaxation.","CAV3-related distal myopathy At least two CAV3 gene mutations have been identified in people with distal myopathy, a disorder characterized by weakness and loss of function mainly affecting the muscles farthest from the center of the body (distal muscles), such as those of the hands and feet. Mutations that cause CAV3-related distal myopathy result in a shortage of caveolin-3 protein in the muscle cell membrane and a reduction in the number of caveolae. Researchers suggest that a shortage of caveolae impairs the structural integrity of muscle cells, interferes with cell signaling, and causes the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). The resulting breakdown of muscle tissue leads to the signs and symptoms of CAV3-related distal myopathy. "
CAVIN1 ,caveolae associated protein 1,"The CAVIN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cavin-1. This protein is found in cells and tissues throughout the body. It is most abundant in several types of cells: osteoblasts, which are cells that build bones; muscle cells; and adipocytes, which are cells that store fats for energy. Adipocytes make up most of the body's fatty (adipose) tissue.Studies suggest that cavin-1 plays an essential role in forming and stabilizing caveolae, which are small pouches in the membrane that surrounds cells. Caveolae have multiple functions, some of which are not well understood. They are known to be involved in the transport of molecules from the cell membrane to the interior of the cell (endocytosis), processing of molecules on their way into the cell, maintaining the cell structure, and regulating chemical signaling pathways. Caveolae are particularly numerous in adipocytes, where they appear to be essential for the normal transport, processing, and storage of fats.Within cells, cavin-1 is also found in the nucleus and in the fluid that surrounds the nucleus (the cytoplasm). In addition to its role in caveolae, studies suggest that this protein is involved in repairing damage to the outer cell membrane, cell growth and division (proliferation), cell movement, stopping cell division in older cells (senescence), and regulating various chemical signaling pathways. The functions of cavin-1 likely differ depending on the type of cell and the part of the cell where the protein is found.","Congenital generalized lipodystrophy More than 10 mutations in the CAVIN1 gene have been found to cause congenital generalized lipodystrophy (also called Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy) type 4. This rare condition is characterized by an almost total absence of adipose tissue and a very muscular appearance. A shortage of adipose tissue leads to multiple health problems, including high levels of fats called triglycerides circulating in the bloodstream (hypertriglyceridemia) and diabetes mellitus. Additional features of congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 4 include muscle weakness, delayed development, joint abnormalities, a narrowing of the lower part of the stomach (pyloric stenosis), and severe abnormalities of the heart rhythm (arrhythmias) that can lead to sudden death.All of the identified CAVIN1 gene mutations prevent cells from producing any functional cavin-1. A lack of this protein probably impairs the formation of caveolae. Researchers suspect that a shortage of these important structures on the cell membrane disrupts many cell functions. However, it is unknown specifically how the absence of cavin-1 leads to a loss of body fat and the other health problems associated with congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 4. "
CBFB ,core-binding factor subunit beta,"The CBFB gene provides instructions for making a protein called core binding factor beta (CBFβ), which is one piece of a protein complex known as core binding factor (CBF). CBFβ attaches (binds) to one of three related RUNX proteins (RUNX1, RUNX2, or RUNX3) to form different versions of CBF. These protein complexes bind to specific regions of DNA and help turn on (activate) certain genes.The presence of CBFβ helps the complex bind to DNA and protects the RUNX protein from being broken down. The function of CBF depends on which RUNX protein it includes. Once bound to DNA, the RUNX1 protein controls the activity of genes involved in the development of blood cells (hematopoiesis). The RUNX2 protein regulates genes important for bone cell development and formation of the skeleton. The RUNX3 protein primarily affects genes involved in the development of nerve cells.","Core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia Rearrangements of genetic material affecting the CBFB gene are involved in a form of blood cancer known as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Because the genetic changes affect CBF, the condition is classified as core binding factor AML (CBF-AML). The most common of these rearrangements is an inversion of a region of chromosome 16 (written as inv(16)). An inversion involves breakage of the chromosome in two places; the resulting piece of DNA is reversed and reinserted into the chromosome. Less commonly, a rearrangement known as a translocation occurs between the two copies of chromosome 16 (written as t(16;16)). In this translocation, pieces of DNA from each copy of the chromosome break off and are interchanged. Both types of genetic rearrangement lead to the fusion of parts of two genes on chromosome 16, CBFB and MYH11. These rearrangements are associated with 5 to 8 percent of cases of AML in adults.When these rearrangements occur in early blood cells, the function of the RUNX1 protein is particularly affected. The protein produced from the fusion gene, called CBFβ-MYH11, can still bind to RUNX1 to form CBF. However, the function of CBF is impaired. The presence of CBFβ-MYH11 may block binding of CBF to DNA, preventing RUNX1 from controlling gene activity. Alternatively, the MYH11 portion of the fusion protein may interact with other proteins that prevent RUNX1 from controlling gene activity. This change in gene activity blocks the maturation (differentiation) of blood cells and leads to the production of abnormal, immature white blood cells called myeloid blasts. While inv(16) and t(16;16) are important for leukemia development, one or more additional genetic changes are typically needed for the myeloid blasts to develop into cancerous leukemia cells. "
CBS ,cystathionine-beta-synthase,"The CBS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called cystathionine beta-synthase. This enzyme acts in a chemical pathway and is responsible for using vitamin B6 to convert building block of proteins (amino acid) called homocysteine and serine to a molecule called cytathionine. Another enzyme then converts cystathionine to the amino acid cysteine, which is used to build proteins or is broken down and excreted in urine. Additionally, other amino acids, including methionine, are produced in this pathway.","Homocystinuria More than 150 mutations that cause homocystinuria have been identified in the CBS gene. Most of these mutations change single amino acids in cystathionine beta-synthase. The most common mutation substitutes the amino acid threonine for the amino acid isoleucine at position 278 in the enzyme (written as Ile278Thr or I278T). Another common mutation, which is the most frequent cause of homocystinuria in the Irish population, replaces the amino acid glycine with the amino acid serine at position 307 (written as Gly307Ser or G307S). These mutations disrupt the normal function of cystathionine beta-synthase. As a result, homocysteine and other potentially toxic compounds build up in the blood, and homocysteine is excreted in urine. Researchers have not determined how excess homocysteine leads to the signs and symptoms of homocystinuria. "
CCBE1 ,collagen and calcium binding EGF domains 1,"The CCBE1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell (extracellular matrix). The CCBE1 protein is involved in the formation of the lymphatic system, which consists of a network of vessels that transport lymph fluid and immune cells throughout the body. Specifically, the CCBE1 protein helps guide maturation (differentiation) and movement (migration) of immature cells called lymphangioblasts that will eventually form the lining (epithelium) of lymphatic vessels.","Hennekam syndrome At least 13 mutations in the CCBE1 gene have been found to cause Hennekam syndrome, an inherited disorder resulting from malformation of the lymphatic system. Most CCBE1 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the CCBE1 protein leading to a change in the three-dimensional shape of the protein. The abnormal protein cannot play its role in the formation of the lymphatic vessel epithelium. A poorly formed lymphatic system leads to lymphatic vessels that are abnormally expanded (lymphangiectasia) and are prone to break open (rupture), puffiness or swelling caused by a buildup of fluid (lymphedema), and other features of Hennekam syndrome. CCBE1 gene mutations account for about 25 percent of all cases of Hennekam syndrome. "
CCM2 ,CCM2 scaffold protein,"The CCM2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called malcavernin, which strengthens the interactions between cells that form blood vessels and limits leakage from the vessels. Malcavernin interacts with a number of other proteins to form a complex that is found in the junctions that connect neighboring cells. As part of this complex, malcavernin helps turn off (suppress) a signaling molecule known as RhoA-GTPase. This molecule plays a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, which is a network of fibers that makes up the cell's structural framework. When turned on, RhoA-GTPase stimulates the formation of actin fibers, which has been linked to weakened junctions between cells and increased leakage from blood vessels.Malcavernin is also involved in a process called angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels.","Cerebral cavernous malformation Dozens of mutations in the CCM2 gene have been identified in families with cerebral cavernous malformations, which are collections of blood vessels in the brain that are weak and prone to leakage. Most of these mutations result in an abnormally short or malformed malcavernin protein that does not function. A shortage of this protein likely impairs the function of the complex. As a result, RhoA-GTPase signaling is turned on abnormally, weakening cellular junctions and increasing the permeability of blood vessel walls. The increased leakage into the brain can cause health problems such as headaches, seizures, and bleeding in the brain (cerebral hemorrhage) in some people with cerebral cavernous malformations.Mutations in the CCM2 gene are involved in approximately 15 percent of all familial cerebral cavernous malformation cases. "
CCN6 ,cellular communication network factor 6,"The CCN6 gene provides instructions for making a protein that appears to be involved in bone growth and the maintenance of cartilage, which covers and protects the ends of bones. The function of the CCN6 protein is not well understood. It is part of a family of proteins that are involved in the growth and maintenance of connective tissues, such as bone, cartilage, and blood vessels. The CCN6 protein is made in cells called chondrocytes, which produce and maintain cartilage, and is associated with the production of certain proteins that make up cartilage, but its role in their production is unclear. CCN6 may also help control signaling pathways involved in the development of cartilage and bone and may help regulate the breakdown of cartilage components.","Progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia Mutations in the CCN6 gene cause progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia (PPRD), which is a condition that causes stiffness and pain in the joints of the hands, hips, knees, and spine. The joint problems worsen over time, and movement in the joints becomes limited. Most of the mutations involved in this condition lead to production of an abnormally short CCN6 protein that is probably nonfunctional. Other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the protein. Loss of CCN6 protein function likely disrupts normal cartilage maintenance and bone growth, leading to the joint problems in PPRD. "
CCND2 ,cyclin D2,"The CCND2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cyclin D2. Cyclins are a family of proteins that control how cells proceed through the multi-step cycle of cell division. Cyclin D2 helps to regulate a step in the cycle called the G1-S transition, in which the cell moves from the G1 phase, when cell growth occurs, to the S phase, when the cell's DNA is copied (replicated) in preparation for cell division. Cyclin D2's role in the cell division cycle makes it a key controller of the rate of cell growth and division (proliferation) in the body.The cyclin D2 protein is regulated by a chemical signaling pathway called the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. This signaling influences many critical cell functions, including the creation (synthesis) of new proteins, cell proliferation, and the survival of cells. The PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is essential for the normal development of many parts of the body, including the brain.","Megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome At least seven mutations in the CCND2 gene have been found to cause megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndrome. This rare condition affects the development of the brain, causing an unusually large brain and head size (megalencephaly) and a brain abnormality called bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria (BPP). Some affected individuals also have an extra finger or toe on one or more of their hands or feet (polydactyly).Each of the known mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the cyclin D2 protein. These changes prevent the protein from being broken down (degraded) when it is no longer needed. The resulting buildup of cyclin D2 in cells triggers them to continue dividing when they otherwise would not have, leading to abnormal cell proliferation. In the brain, the increased number of cells leads to rapid and abnormal brain growth starting before birth. It is less clear how a buildup of cyclin D2 contributes to polydactyly, although the extra digits are probably related to abnormal cell proliferation in the developing hands and feet. "
CD40LG ,CD40 ligand,"The CD40LG gene provides instructions for making a protein called CD40 ligand, which is found on the surface of immune system cells known as T cells. CD40 ligand attaches like a key in a lock to its receptor protein, CD40, which is located on the surface of immune system cells known as B cells. B cells are involved in the production of proteins called antibodies or immunoglobulins that help protect the body against infection. There are several classes of antibodies, and each one has a different function in the immune system. B cells are able to mature into the cells that produce immunoglobulin M (IgM) without any signals from other cells. In order for B cells to mature into the cells that produce antibodies of a different class, the CD40 receptor must interact with CD40 ligand. When these two proteins are connected, they trigger a series of chemical signals that instruct the B cell to start making immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin E (IgE).CD40 ligand is also necessary for T cells to interact with other cells of the immune system, and it plays a key role in T cell differentiation (the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions).","X-linked hyper IgM syndrome More than 150 mutations in the CD40LG gene have been found to cause X-linked hyper IgM syndrome. These mutations lead to the production of an abnormal CD40 ligand or prevent production of this protein. If CD40 ligand does not attach to its receptor on B cells, these cells cannot produce IgG, IgA, or IgE antibodies. Mutations in the CD40LG gene also impair the T cell's ability to differentiate and interact with immune system cells. People with X-linked hyper IgM syndrome are more susceptible to infections because they do not have a properly functioning immune system. "
CDAN1 ,codanin 1,"The CDAN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called codanin-1. Although this protein is active in cells throughout the body, very little is known about its function.A recent study suggests that codanin-1 is associated with a form of DNA called heterochromatin. Heterochromatin is densely packed DNA that contains few functional genes, but it plays an important role in maintaining the structure of the nucleus (where most of the cell's DNA is located).Researchers speculate that codanin-1 may be involved in the formation of red blood cells, a process called erythropoiesis. Specifically, this protein may play a key role in the organization of heterochromatin during the division of these developing cells.","Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia More than 30 mutations in the CDAN1 gene have been identified in people with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) type I. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the codanin-1 protein. The CDAN1 mutations that cause CDA type I likely reduce the function of codanin-1. However, researchers suspect that these mutations do not completely eliminate the function of the protein, which appears to be essential for life.It is unclear how CDAN1 mutations cause the characteristic features of CDA type I. A shortage of functional codanin-1 somehow disrupts the normal development of red blood cells. In people with CDA type I, immature red blood cells called erythroblasts are large, unusually shaped, and have an abnormally formed nucleus. These defective erythroblasts cannot develop into functional mature red blood cells. The resulting shortage of healthy red blood cells leads to the characteristic signs and symptoms of anemia, as well as complications including an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) and an abnormal buildup of iron that can damage the body's organs. "
CDC6 ,cell division cycle 6,"The CDC6 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is important in the copying of a cell's DNA before the cell divides (a process known as DNA replication). The protein produced from this gene, called cell division cycle 6 or CDC6, is one of a group of proteins known as the pre-replication complex. In a multi-step process, the components of this complex attach (bind) to certain regions of DNA known as origins of replication (or origins), where the process of DNA copying begins. When the pre-replication complex is attached to the origin, replication is able to begin at that location. This tightly controlled process, called replication licensing, helps ensure that DNA replication occurs only once per cell division and is required for cells to divide.","Meier-Gorlin syndrome At least one mutation in the CDC6 gene causes Meier-Gorlin syndrome, a condition characterized by short stature, underdeveloped kneecaps, and small ears. This mutation, which is a rare cause of the condition, changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the CDC6 protein, replacing the amino acid threonine at position 323 with the amino acid arginine (written as Thr323Arg). As a result, assembly of the pre-replication complex is impaired, which disrupts replication licensing; however, it is not clear how a reduction in replication licensing leads to Meier-Gorlin syndrome. Researchers speculate that such a reduction delays the cell division process, which slows growth of the bones and other tissues during development. It is not known why development of the kneecaps and ears is particularly affected in Meier-Gorlin syndrome. "
CDC73 ,cell division cycle 73,"The CDC73 gene (also known as HRPT2) provides instructions for making a protein called parafibromin. This protein is found primarily in the nucleus of cells and is likely involved in regulating gene transcription, which is the first step in protein production. Parafibromin functions as a tumor suppressor, which means it keeps cells from growing and dividing (proliferating) too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. When parafibromin is found outside the nucleus, it appears to be involved in the organization of the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton).","Familial isolated hyperparathyroidism Inherited mutations in the CDC73 gene have been found in some families with familial isolated hyperparathyroidism, a condition characterized by overactivity of the parathyroid glands (primary hyperparathyroidism). These glands release a hormone that helps control the normal balance of calcium in the blood. Primary hyperparathyroidism disrupts this balance, which can lead to high blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia), kidney stones, thinning of the bones (osteoporosis), nausea, vomiting, high blood pressure (hypertension), weakness, and fatigue. Primary hyperparathyroidism is a characteristic feature of hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome (described below); however, familial isolated hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed in people with hyperparathyroidism but not the other features of hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome.CDC73 gene mutations that cause familial isolated hyperparathyroidism likely result in decreased activity of the parafibromin protein. Reduced parafibromin activity can cause increased cell proliferation, leading to the formation of tumors involving the parathyroid glands. Parathyroid tumors in people with familial isolated hyperparathyroidism are usually noncancerous (benign). The tumors cause the glands to be overactive, and this overactivity leads to the signs and symptoms of the condition. The mutations associated with familial isolated hyperparathyroidism are thought to have a less severe effect on protein function than those that cause hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome. Occasionally, individuals with familial isolated hyperparathyroidism later develop features of hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, although some never do. Familial isolated hyperparathyroidism caused by CDC73 gene mutations may be an early or mild form of hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome. "
CDH1 ,cadherin 1,"The CDH1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called epithelial cadherin or E-cadherin. This protein is found within the membrane that surrounds epithelial cells, which are the cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body, such as the inside of the eyelids and mouth. E-cadherin belongs to a family of proteins called cadherins whose function is to help neighboring cells stick to one another (cell adhesion) to form organized tissues. Another protein called p120-catenin, produced from the CTNND1 gene, helps keep E-cadherin in its proper place in the cell membrane, preventing it from being taken into the cell through a process called endocytosis and broken down prematurely.E-cadherin is one of the best-understood cadherin proteins. In addition to its role in cell adhesion, E-cadherin is involved in transmitting chemical signals within cells, controlling cell maturation and movement, and regulating the activity of certain genes. Interactions between the E-cadherin and p120-catenin proteins, in particular, are thought to be important for normal development of the head and face (craniofacial development), including the eyelids and teeth. E-cadherin also acts as a tumor suppressor protein, which means it prevents cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.","Blepharocheilodontic syndrome At least five inherited CDH1 gene mutations have been identified in people with blepharocheilodontic (BCD) syndrome. This disorder is present at birth and causes abnormalities mainly affecting the eyelids and mouth, including openings on both sides of the upper lip (bilateral cleft lip) and an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate). CDH1 gene mutations that cause BCD syndrome are thought to result in an abnormal E-cadherin protein that is quickly broken down. A shortage of E-cadherin protein impairs the interaction between E-cadherin and p120-catenin and affects craniofacial development, leading to the features of BCD syndrome. Despite the association of CDH1 gene mutations with increased cancer risk (see below), it is unclear whether people with BCD syndrome are at increased risk of developing cancer. "
CDH23 ,cadherin related 23,"The CDH23 gene provides instructions for making cadherin 23, a type of protein that helps cells stick together. Different versions of this protein are made in different cell types, including a short version in the retina, which is the light-sensitive layer in the back of the eye, and a longer version in the inner ear. Cadherin 23 interacts with other proteins in the cell membrane as part of a protein complex that is involved in cell attachment.Research suggests that the cadherin 23 protein complex helps to shape structures in the inner ear called hair bundles. These structures are made of stereocilia, which are hairlike projections that bend in response to sound waves. This bending motion is critical for converting sound waves to nerve impulses, which are then transmitted to the brain. Stereocilia are also elements of the vestibular system, the part of the inner ear that helps maintain the body's balance and orientation in space. Bending of these stereocilia is needed to transmit signals from the vestibular system to the brain.In the retina, the role of the cadherin 23 protein complex is less well understood. Studies suggest that it plays a critical role in the function of photoreceptor cells, which are specialized cells that detect light and color.","Nonsyndromic hearing loss Several dozen mutations in the CDH23 gene have been identified in people with nonsyndromic hearing loss, which is loss of hearing that is not associated with other signs and symptoms. Mutations in this gene cause a form of hearing loss designated as DFNB12. This type of hearing loss begins before a child learns to speak (prelingual) and is severe to profound.Most of the mutations that cause DFNB12 change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in cadherin 23. These mutations reduce but do not eliminate the function of this protein. The altered protein disrupts development of stereocilia in the inner ear, which leads to hearing loss.Researchers speculate that some children with apparently nonsyndromic hearing loss caused by a CDH23 mutation may actually have Usher syndrome (described below). A few children thought to have DFNB12 have developed the vision disorder retinitis pigmentosa later in life, which is characteristic of Usher syndrome. "
CDKL5 ,cyclin dependent kinase like 5,"The CDKL5 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in cells and tissues throughout the body. However, it is most active in the brain and is essential for normal brain development and function. There are five versions (isoforms) of the CDKL5 protein. These isoforms vary in length and in the tissues in which they are most abundant.Studies suggest that the CDKL5 protein is involved in the formation, growth, and movement (migration) of nerve cells (neurons), as well as cell division. It also plays a role in the transmission of chemical signals at the connections (synapses) between neurons.The CDKL5 protein acts as a kinase, which is an enzyme that changes the activity of other proteins by adding a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) at specific positions. It is possible that one of the proteins targeted by the CDKL5 protein is MeCP2, which is produced from the MECP2 gene. The MeCP2 protein plays important roles in the function of neurons and other brain cells and in the maintenance of neuronal synapses. Researchers have not determined which other proteins are targeted by the CDKL5 protein.","CDKL5 deficiency disorder At least 150 mutations in the CDKL5 gene have been found to cause CDKL5 deficiency disorder. This rare condition is characterized by seizures that begin in infancy, followed by significant delays in many aspects of development. Affected individuals have severe intellectual disability and most do not walk independently. About 90 percent of people diagnosed with CDKL5 deficiency disorder are female.CDKL5 deficiency disorder was previously classified as an atypical form of Rett syndrome. However, CDKL5 deficiency disorder is now considered a separate condition. Rett syndrome, which affects development in girls and women, results from mutations in the MECP2 gene. Because the CDKL5 and MeCP2 proteins may interact in the brain, the two disorders might be caused by a similar mechanism.Mutations in the CDKL5 gene reduce the amount of functional CDKL5 protein or alter its activity in neurons. A shortage (deficiency) of CDKL5 or impairment of its function disrupts brain development, but it is unclear how these changes cause the specific features of CDKL5 deficiency disorder.Most CDKL5 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the CDKL5 protein. This type of mutation occurs most often in a region of the protein called the kinase domain, which is essential for the protein's kinase function. Mutations in the kinase domain disrupt the ability of CDKL5 to add phosphate groups to other proteins. Compared with other types of mutation, these mutations are associated with more severe signs and symptoms of CDKL5 deficiency disorder.Other CDKL5 gene mutations alter different regions of the CDKL5 protein or lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the protein. Research has shown that mutations affecting parts of the protein other than the kinase domain tend to cause less severe signs and symptoms of CDKL5 deficiency disorder than other types of mutations. "
CDKN1B ,cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B,"The CDKN1B gene provides instructions for making a protein called p27. This protein is found in cells and tissues throughout the body. Within cells, p27 is located primarily in the nucleus, where it plays a critical role in controlling cell growth and division. It helps regulate the cell cycle, which is the cell's way of replicating itself in an organized, step-by-step fashion. Specifically, p27 normally blocks cells from entering the phase of the cell cycle when DNA is copied (replicated) in preparation for cell division. By blocking cell cycle progression, p27 prevents cells from dividing too quickly or at the wrong time. Based on this function, p27 is described as a tumor suppressor protein. Studies suggest that p27 is also involved in controlling cell differentiation, which is the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions.Because p27 plays such a key role in controlling cell division, its activity is tightly regulated. Regulation can occur through modification of the p27 protein's structure, its interaction with other proteins, or its localization within the cell. For example, when p27 is held (sequestered) in the fluid that surrounds the nucleus (the cytoplasm) instead of being transported into the nucleus, the protein is unavailable to block cell cycle progression. Researchers believe that p27 may have other functions in the cytoplasm, but these functions have not been well described.","Multiple endocrine neoplasia At least eight mutations in the CDKN1B gene have been found to cause a relatively rare form of multiple endocrine neoplasia called type 4. Multiple endocrine neoplasia typically involves the development of tumors in two or more of the body's hormone-producing glands, called endocrine glands. These tumors can be noncancerous or cancerous. The most common endocrine glands affected in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4 are the parathyroid glands and the pituitary gland, although additional endocrine glands and other organs can also be involved.Most of the CDKN1B gene mutations that cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4 change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the p27 protein. Some mutations impair the protein's ability to interact with regulatory proteins, while others lead to the production of an unstable version of p27 that is quickly broken down. Still other mutations prevent p27 from moving from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. All of these mutations reduce the amount of functional p27 that is available in the nucleus to regulate the cell cycle. Cells with a shortage of functional p27 can divide too quickly or in an uncontrolled way, forming a tumor. It is unclear why these tumors occur primarily in endocrine glands; studies suggest that certain endocrine cells may be particularly dependent on the p27 protein to control cell division. "
CDKN1C ,cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1C,"The CDKN1C gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps regulate growth. This protein acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it keeps cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way. It also is involved in controlling growth before birth, preventing the developing fetus from becoming too large.People inherit one copy of most genes from their mother and one copy from their father. Both copies are typically active, or ""turned on,"" in cells. However, the activity of the CDKN1C gene depends on which parent it was inherited from. In most tissues, the copy of the gene inherited from a person's mother (the maternally inherited copy) has much higher activity than the copy inherited from the father (the paternally inherited copy). This sort of parent-specific difference in gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting.CDKN1C is part of a cluster of genes on the short (p) arm of chromosome 11 that undergo genomic imprinting. A nearby region of DNA known as imprinting center 2 (IC2) or KvDMR controls the parent-specific genomic imprinting of CDKN1C and several other genes thought to help regulate growth. The IC2 region undergoes a process called methylation, which is a chemical reaction that attaches small molecules called methyl groups to certain segments of DNA. Methylation, which occurs during the formation of an egg or sperm cell, is a way of marking or ""stamping"" the parent of origin. The IC2 region is normally methylated only on the maternally inherited copy of chromosome 11.","Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that causes overgrowth and has other signs and symptoms that affect many parts of the body. At least half of all cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome result from changes in methylation of the IC2 region. Specifically, the maternally inherited copy of the IC2 region has too few methyl groups attached (hypomethylation). This abnormality disrupts the regulation of several genes that are normally controlled by IC2, including CDKN1C. Because this gene normally restrains cell growth and division, a reduction in its activity leads to overgrowth and the other features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.In a few cases, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome has been caused by deletions of a small amount of DNA from the maternally inherited copy of the IC2 region. Like abnormal methylation, these deletions disrupt the activity of several genes, including CDKN1C.Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome can also result from mutations within the maternally inherited copy of the CDKN1C gene. More than two dozen such mutations have been identified. Some of these genetic changes lead to an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the CDKN1C protein, while others alter single protein building blocks (amino acids) or delete a small number of amino acids from the protein. All of these mutations are described as ""loss-of-function"" because they alter the structure of the CDKN1C protein such that it can no longer control growth effectively. The resulting problems with growth regulation lead to overgrowth and the other features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. "
CDKN2A ,cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A,"The CDKN2A gene provides instructions for making several proteins. The most well-studied are the p16(INK4A) and the p14(ARF) proteins. Both function as tumor suppressors, which means they keep cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Both proteins are also involved in stopping cell division in older cells (senescence).The p16(INK4A) protein attaches (binds) to two other proteins called CDK4 and CDK6. These proteins help regulate the cell cycle, which is the cell's way of replicating itself in an organized, step-by-step fashion. CDK4 and CDK6 normally stimulate the cell to continue through the cycle and divide. However, binding of p16(INK4A) blocks CDK4's or CDK6's ability to stimulate cell cycle progression. In this way, p16(INK4A) controls cell division. Cells begin to produce p16(INK4A) when they are no longer able to undergo cell division.The p14(ARF) protein protects a different protein called p53 from being broken down. The p53 protein is an important tumor suppressor that is essential for regulating cell division, senescence, and self-destruction (apoptosis). By protecting p53, p14(ARF) also helps prevent tumor formation. The p14(ARF) and p53 proteins are often made in cells that are unable to undergo cell division.",Bladder cancer Genetics Home Reference provides information about bladder cancer. 
CDT1 ,chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1,"The CDT1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is important in the copying of a cell's DNA before the cell divides (a process known as DNA replication). The protein produced from this gene is one of a group of proteins known as the pre-replication complex. In a multi-step process, the components of this complex attach (bind) to certain regions of DNA known as origins of replication (or origins), where the process of DNA copying begins. When the pre-replication complex is attached to the origin, replication is able to begin at that location. This tightly controlled process, called replication licensing, helps ensure that DNA replication occurs only once per cell division and is required for cells to divide.","Meier-Gorlin syndrome Mutations in the CDT1 gene cause Meier-Gorlin syndrome, a condition characterized by short stature, underdeveloped kneecaps, and small ears. These mutations alter the CDT1 protein, typically by changing single protein building blocks (amino acids) or by leading to production of an abnormally short version of the CDT1 protein. As a result, assembly of the pre-replication complex is impaired, which disrupts replication licensing; however, it is not clear how a reduction in replication licensing leads to Meier-Gorlin syndrome. Researchers speculate that such a reduction delays the cell division process, which slows growth of the bones and other tissues during development. It is not known why development of the kneecaps and ears is particularly affected. "
CEBPA ,CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha,"The CEBPA gene provides instructions for making a protein called CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha. This protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity (expression) of certain genes. CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha is involved in the maturation (differentiation) of certain blood cells. It is also believed to act as a tumor suppressor, which means that it is involved in cellular mechanisms that help prevent the cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.","Familial acute myeloid leukemia with mutated CEBPA At least six mutations in the CEBPA gene have been identified in families with familial acute myeloid leukemia with mutated CEBPA, which is a form of a blood cancer known as acute myeloid leukemia. These inherited mutations are present throughout a person's life in virtually every cell in the body. The mutations result in a shorter version of CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha. This shortened protein is produced from one copy of the CEBPA gene in each cell, and it is believed to interfere with the tumor suppressor function of the normal protein produced from the second copy of the gene. Absence of the tumor suppressor function of CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha is believed to disrupt the regulation of blood cell production, leading to the uncontrolled production of abnormal cells that occurs in acute myeloid leukemia.In addition to the inherited mutation in one copy of the CEBPA gene in each cell, most individuals with familial acute myeloid leukemia with mutated CEBPA also acquire a mutation in the second copy of the CEBPA gene. The additional mutation, which is called a somatic mutation, is found only in the cancerous leukemia cells and is not inherited. The somatic CEBPA gene mutations that have been identified in leukemia cells generally decrease the DNA-binding ability of CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha. Researchers suggest that this second mutation may affect the normal differentiation of blood cells, although exactly how the mutation is involved in the development of acute myeloid leukemia is unclear. "
CEP57 ,centrosomal protein 57,"The CEP57 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not completely understood. Within cells, the CEP57 protein is located in structures called centrosomes. Centrosomes have a role in cell division and the assembly of microtubules. Microtubules are fibers that help cells maintain their shape, assist in the process of cell division, and are essential for the movement (transport) of materials within cells. CEP57 seems especially important for the organization and stability of specialized microtubules called spindle microtubules, which are important for cell division. Before cells divide, they copy all of their chromosomes. Spindle microtubules, which are produced by centrosomes, attach to the duplicated chromosomes and pull one copy of each to opposite ends of the cell so that each new cell contains one complete set of chromosomes.The CEP57 protein is also involved in the transport of certain molecules along microtubules, particularly a protein called fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). FGF2 is an important signaling molecule that helps regulate growth and development of cells and tissues, and its transport inside the cell is important for relaying signals that instruct the cell how to function.","Mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome At least three CEP57 gene mutations have been found to cause mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA) syndrome type 2. This condition is characterized by cells with abnormal numbers of chromosomes, a situation known as aneuploidy. Affected individuals grow slowly before and after birth and may have mild intellectual disability and other health problems.CEP57 gene mutations involved in MVA syndrome type 2 likely reduce the amount of functional CEP57 protein in cells. It is unclear how these changes lead to the features of the condition. Researchers speculate that impairment of the protein's role in stabilizing spindle microtubules may prevent the normal separation of chromosomes during cell division, leading to aneuploidy. Although they are unsure how CEP57 gene mutations lead to the other features of MVA syndrome type 2, some suggest that the shortage of functional CEP57 protein prevents proper transport of FGF2, which may impair cell signaling and lead to problems with growth and development. "
CEP290 ,centrosomal protein 290,"The CEP290 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is present in many types of cells. Although this protein's function is not well understood, studies suggest that it plays an important role in cell structures called centrosomes and cilia. Centrosomes are involved in cell division and the assembly of microtubules, which are proteins that transport materials in cells and help the cell maintain its shape. Cilia are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. Cilia are involved in cell movement and many different chemical signaling pathways. They are also necessary for the perception of sensory input (such as vision, hearing, and smell).","Leber congenital amaurosis At least 35 mutations in the CEP290 gene have been found to cause Leber congenital amaurosis. Mutations in this gene account for 15 to 22 percent of all cases of this condition.A particular genetic change, written as 2991+1655A>G, is the most common CEP290 gene mutation associated with Leber congenital amaurosis. This mutation reduces the production of functional CEP290 protein to very low levels in cells. Other genetic changes responsible for this disorder result in the production of abnormally short, nonfunctional versions of the CEP290 protein.It is unclear how mutations in the CEP290 gene cause the characteristic features of Leber congenital amaurosis. A shortage of the CEP290 protein clearly affects the development of the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. Light-sensing cells (photoreceptors) in the retina contain cilia, which are essential for normal vision. Abnormalities involving these cilia may lead to the severe, early visual impairment characteristic of Leber congenital amaurosis. "
CFH ,complement factor H,"The CFH gene provides instructions for making a protein called complement factor H. This protein helps regulate a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (such as bacteria and viruses), trigger an inflammatory response, and remove debris from cells and tissues. This system must be carefully regulated so it targets only unwanted materials and does not damage the body's healthy cells. Complement factor H, together with several related proteins, protects healthy cells by preventing the complement system from being turned on (activated) when it is not needed.","C3 glomerulopathy Several mutations in the CFH gene have been found to cause a rare form of kidney disease called C3 glomerulopathy. This disorder damages the kidneys and can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a life-threatening condition that prevents the kidneys from filtering fluids and waste products from the body effectively.Most of the CFH gene mutations that cause C3 glomerulopathy change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in complement factor H. These mutations prevent cells from making this protein or lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of the protein. The resulting shortage (deficiency) of complement factor H overactivates the complement system, which damages structures called glomeruli in the kidneys. These structures are clusters of tiny blood vessels that help filter waste products from the blood. Damage to glomeruli prevents the kidneys from filtering waste products normally and can lead to ESRD.Several other changes involving the CFH gene do not cause C3 glomerulopathy directly but appear to increase the likelihood of developing the disorder. The best-studied of these gene variations (polymorphisms) is written as Tyr402His or Y402H. Complement factor H usually has the amino acid tyrosine (Tyr/Y) at position 402, but sometimes it has the amino acid histidine (His/H) instead. People with C3 glomerulopathy are more likely than people in the general population to have histidine at this position. The version of complement factor H with histidine at position 402 is less effective at regulating the complement system on cell surfaces than the version with tyrosine at position 402, which may help explain the increased disease risk. "
CFHR5 ,complement factor H related 5,"The CFHR5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called complement factor H-related 5. The precise function of this protein is unknown. However, its structure is similar to that of a protein called complement factor H (which is produced from the CFH gene). This similarity provides clues to the probable function of complement factor H-related 5.Complement factor H regulates a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (such as bacteria and viruses), trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. This system must be carefully regulated so it targets only unwanted materials and does not damage the body's healthy cells. Complement factor H helps to protect healthy cells by preventing the complement system from being turned on (activated) when it is not needed. Studies suggest that complement factor H-related 5 also plays a role in controlling the complement system.","C3 glomerulopathy Several mutations in the CFHR5 gene have been found to cause a rare form of kidney disease called C3 glomerulopathy. This disorder damages the kidneys and can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a life-threatening condition that prevents the kidneys from filtering fluids and waste products from the body effectively.The most common CFHR5 gene mutation has been identified in people from the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. This genetic change abnormally copies (duplicates) regions of the CFHR5 gene known as exons 2 and 3. The duplication alters the structure and function of complement factor H-related 5, preventing it from regulating the complement system effectively. As a result, the complement system becomes overactive, which damages structures called glomeruli in the kidneys. These structures are clusters of tiny blood vessels that help filter waste products from the blood. Damage to glomeruli prevents the kidneys from filtering waste products normally and can lead to ESRD.Several other changes involving the CFHR5 gene do not cause C3 glomerulopathy directly but appear to increase the likelihood of developing the disorder. It is unclear how variations in this gene affect the regulation of the complement system, and researchers are still working to determine how these genetic changes contribute to disease risk. "
CFI ,complement factor I,"The CFI gene provides instructions for making a protein called complement factor I. This protein helps regulate a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (such as bacteria and viruses), trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. This system must be carefully regulated so it targets only unwanted materials and does not attack the body's healthy cells. Complement factor I and several related proteins protect healthy cells by preventing activation of the complement system when it is not needed.","Complement factor I deficiency At least 10 mutations in the CFI gene have been identified in people with complement factor I deficiency, a disorder characterized by immune system dysfunction. The mutations result in abnormal, nonfunctional, or absent complement factor I.The lack (deficiency) of functional complement factor I protein allows uncontrolled activation of the complement system. The unregulated activity of the complement system decreases blood levels of another complement protein called C3, reducing the immune system's ability to fight infections. In addition, the immune system may malfunction and attack its own tissues, resulting in autoimmune disorders. "
CFTR ,cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator,"The CFTR gene provides instructions for making a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. This protein functions as a channel across the membrane of cells that produce mucus, sweat, saliva, tears, and digestive enzymes. The channel transports negatively charged particles called chloride ions into and out of cells. The transport of chloride ions helps control the movement of water in tissues, which is necessary for the production of thin, freely flowing mucus. Mucus is a slippery substance that lubricates and protects the lining of the airways, digestive system, reproductive system, and other organs and tissues.The CFTR protein also regulates the function of other channels, such as those that transport positively charged particles called sodium ions across cell membranes. These channels are necessary for the normal function of organs such as the lungs and pancreas.","Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens About 80 CFTR mutations have been identified in males with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens. Most affected males have a mild mutation in at least one copy of the gene in each cell. These mutations allow the CFTR protein to retain some of its function. Some affected males have a mild mutation in one copy of the CFTR gene in each cell and a more severe, cystic fibrosis-causing mutation in the other copy of the gene.Mutations in the CFTR gene disrupt the function of the chloride channel, preventing the usual flow of chloride ions and water into and out of cells. As a result, cells in the male genital tract produce mucus that is abnormally thick and sticky. This mucus clogs the tubes that carry sperm from the testes (the vas deferens) as they are forming, causing them to deteriorate before birth. Without the vas deferens, sperm cannot be transported from the testes to become part of semen. Men with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens are unable to father children (infertile) unless they use assisted reproductive technologies. "
CHAT ,choline O-acetyltransferase,"The CHAT gene provides instructions for making a protein called choline acetyltransferase. This protein is located at the ends of nerve cells in specialized areas called presynaptic terminals. Choline acetyltransferase facilitates the production of a molecule called acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is essential for normal muscle movement. When acetylcholine is released from the presynaptic terminal, it attaches (binds) to a receptor protein located in the membrane of muscle cells. When acetylcholine binds to its receptor protein, specialized channels in the receptor then open, allowing certain charged atoms (ions) to flow into and out of muscle cells. The flow of these ions allows for muscle contraction and relaxation, resulting in muscle movement.","Congenital myasthenic syndrome More than 30 mutations in the CHAT gene have been found to cause congenital myasthenic syndrome. Most of these mutations replace single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the CHAT gene. The mutations lead to decreased production of choline acetyltransferase or the production of a protein with decreased ability to aid in the production of acetylcholine. The resulting lack of acetylcholine decreases the availability of open receptors, impairing ion flow through muscle cells. A reduction in muscle cell ion flow decreases muscle movement leading to muscle weakness characteristic of congenital myasthenic syndrome. In addition, people with congenital myasthenic syndrome who have mutations in the CHAT gene are more likely than affected individuals with mutations in other genes to have short pauses in breathing (apnea), but the cause for this association is unclear. "
CHD2 ,chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 2,"The CHD2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called chromodomain DNA helicase protein 2. This protein is found in cells throughout the body and regulates gene activity (expression) through a process known as chromatin remodeling. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and proteins that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. When DNA is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when DNA is loosely packed. Chromodomain DNA helicase protein 2 appears to play an important role in the brain, although its function is not well understood. Research suggests that it may help control development or functioning of nerve cells (neurons).","CHD2 myoclonic encephalopathy At least 30 mutations in the CHD2 gene have been found to cause CHD2 myoclonic encephalopathy, a condition characterized by recurrent seizures (epilepsy), abnormal brain function (encephalopathy), and intellectual disability beginning in childhood. About half of these mutations delete pieces of DNA from the CHD2 gene. These and other CHD2 gene mutations either prevent the production of any chromodomain DNA helicase protein 2 or lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of the protein. As a result, chromatin remodeling and gene expression normally regulated by the chromodomain DNA helicase protein 2 are disrupted. It is unclear why CHD2 gene mutations seem to only affect nerve cells in the brain or how they lead to the signs and symptoms of CHD2 myoclonic encephalopathy. "
CHD7 ,chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7,"The CHD7 gene provides instructions for making a protein called chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7. This protein is found in many parts of the body before birth, including the eye, the inner ear, and the brain. In the brain, the CHD7 protein is active in several areas, including a bundle of nerve cells (neurons) called the olfactory bulb that is critical for the perception of odors.The CHD7 protein belongs to a family of proteins that are thought to play a role in the organization of chromatin. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and protein that packages DNA into chromosomes. The CHD7 protein regulates the activity (expression) of several other genes through a process known as chromatin remodeling. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. When DNA is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when DNA is loosely packed. Researchers are working to determine which genes the CHD7 protein regulates.","CHARGE syndrome Mutations in the CHD7 gene cause CHARGE syndrome, a disorder that affects many areas of the body. CHARGE is an abbreviation for several of the features common in the disorder: coloboma, heart defect, atresia choanae (also known as choanal atresia), growth retardation, genital abnormality, and ear abnormality. More than 600 mutations that can cause CHARGE syndrome have been identified, and they occur throughout the CHD7 gene. Most of these mutations lead to the production of an abnormal CHD7 protein that is broken down prematurely. Shortage of this protein is thought to disrupt chromatin remodeling and the regulation of gene expression. Changes in gene expression during embryonic development likely cause the signs and symptoms of CHARGE syndrome. "
CHD8 ,chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 8,"The CHD8 gene provides instructions for making a protein that regulates gene activity (expression) by a process known as chromatin remodeling. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and protein that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. When DNA is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when DNA is loosely packed. Chromatin remodeling is one way gene expression is regulated during development.The CHD8 protein is thought to affect the expression of many other genes that are involved in brain development before birth. In particular, the CHD8 protein and the genes it regulates likely help control the development of neural progenitor cells, which give rise to nerve cells (neurons), and the growth and division (proliferation) and maturation (differentiation) of neurons. In this way, the CHD8 protein helps to control the number of neurons in the brain and prevent overgrowth.","Autism spectrum disorder More than 30 CHD8 gene mutations have been identified in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a varied condition characterized by impaired social skills, communication problems, and repetitive behaviors. Mutations in the CHD8 gene impair the function of the CHD8 protein, and may interfere with its ability to help control the number and growth of neurons in the brain. Excess neurons and overgrowth in parts of the brain are associated with ASD, but the relationship between these abnormalities and the behavioral features of the disorder is unknown. "
CHM ,"CHM, Rab escort protein 1","The CHM gene provides instructions for producing the Rab escort protein-1 (REP-1), which is active (expressed) throughout the body. As an escort protein, REP-1 attaches (binds) to one of a number of Rab proteins. Following a chemical modification, REP-1 then directs the Rab protein to the membrane of one of the cell's compartments (organelles). While attached to the membrane, the Rab protein plays a role in directing the movement of proteins and organelles within cells (intracellular trafficking). After the Rab protein has reached its destination, it is released by REP-1 which then attaches to another Rab protein to begin the process again.","Choroideremia More than 140 mutations in the CHM gene have been found to cause choroideremia. Nearly all of these mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional REP-1 protein. Other gene mutations result in a decrease in the protein's function or delete part or all of the gene and abolish REP-1 protein production. A lack of normal REP-1 disrupts the ability of Rab proteins to aid in intracellular trafficking. The immobility of proteins and organelles within the cell cause the cell to die prematurely.The REP-1 protein is active (expressed) throughout the body, as is a similar protein, REP-2. Research suggests that when REP-1 is absent or not functioning properly, REP-2 can perform the protein escort duties of REP-1 in many of the body's tissues. Very little REP-2 protein is present in the light sensitive-tissue at the back of the eye (the retina), however, so it cannot compensate for the loss of REP-1 in this tissue. Loss of REP-1 function and subsequent misplacement of Rab proteins within the cells of the retina causes the progressive vision loss characteristic of choroideremia. "
CHMP2B ,charged multivesicular body protein 2B,"The CHMP2B gene provides instructions for making a protein called charged multivesicular body protein 2B. This protein is active in the brain, where it appears to be essential for the survival of nerve cells (neurons).Charged multivesicular body protein 2B forms one part (subunit) of a group of proteins known as the ESCRT-III complex. This complex helps transport other proteins from the cell membrane to the interior of the cell, a process known as endocytosis. In particular, the ESCRT-III complex is involved in the endocytosis of proteins that need to be broken down (degraded) by the cell. The complex helps sort these proteins into structures called multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which deliver them to lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments within cells that digest and recycle many different types of molecules.Charged multivesicular body protein 2B is regulated by a segment at one end of the protein known as the C-terminal domain. This domain usually keeps the protein turned off (inactive). The inactive protein is unable to interact with other subunits of the ESCRT-III complex, which prevents the complex from forming when it is not needed. The C-terminal domain also plays an important role in disassembling the ESCRT-III complex through its interaction with a protein called vacuolar protein sorting 4 (Vps4).","CHMP2B-related frontotemporal dementia Several changes in the CHMP2B gene have been identified in people with frontotemporal dementia. At least two of these genetic changes are thought to be mutations that cause the disease. It is unclear whether the other genetic changes also cause disease; they may be rare variations that are unrelated to the development of frontotemporal dementia.Most people with CHMP2B-related frontotemporal dementia are members of a single, large Danish family. Affected individuals in this family have a particular mutation, written as 532-1G>C, that changes a single DNA building block (base pair) in the CHMP2B gene. This mutation leads to the production of two abnormal versions of charged multivesicular body protein 2B, both of which are missing the C-terminal domain.Without the C-terminal domain, charged multivesicular body protein 2B is constantly turned on (active) as part of the ESCRT-III complex. It cannot interact with Vps4, so the complex cannot be disassembled when it is no longer needed. As a result, the ESCRT-III complex builds up within cells and disrupts the transport and degradation of other proteins. These abnormalities ultimately lead to the death of neurons in the brain.A gradual loss of neurons throughout the brain is characteristic of CHMP2B-related frontotemporal dementia. Many of the features of this disease result from neuronal death in regions near the front of the brain called the frontal and temporal lobes. The frontal lobes are involved in reasoning, planning, judgment, and problem-solving, while the temporal lobes help process hearing, speech, memory, and emotion. It is unclear why the signs and symptoms of this disease are related primarily to the frontal and temporal lobes. "
CHN1 ,chimerin 1,"The CHN1 gene provides instructions for making two very similar proteins called α1-chimaerin and α2-chimaerin. These proteins play an important role in the early development of the nervous system. In particular, they help regulate complex chemical signaling pathways during the formation and development of nerve cells (neurons). These proteins help guide the growth of axons and dendrites, which are specialized extensions of neurons that transmit and receive nerve impulses throughout the nervous system.The CHN1 proteins, particularly α2-chimaerin, appear to be critical for the formation of certain nerves in the head and face. Specifically, they are necessary for the development and function of cranial nerve VI and, to a lesser extent, cranial nerve III. These nerves emerge from the brain and control several of the muscles that surround the eyes (extraocular muscles). The extraocular muscles direct eye movement and determine the position of the eyes.","Isolated Duane retraction syndrome At least seven mutations in the CHN1 gene have been identified in families with isolated Duane retraction syndrome. Researchers believe that the features of this condition result from changes in one of the two versions of the CHN1 protein, α2-chimaerin. Each identified mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in α2-chimaerin. Although several mutations also affect α1-chimaerin, researchers think that changes in α1-chimaerin alone do not cause isolated Duane retraction syndrome.CHN1 mutations alter the structure and function of α2-chimaerin in the developing nervous system. These genetic changes appear to overactivate the protein, which disrupts the normal growth of neurons in certain parts of the brain. As a result, cranial nerves VI and III and the extraocular muscles they control do not develop normally. Abnormal development and function of these muscles leads to the characteristic features of isolated Duane retraction syndrome, including restricted eye movement and related problems with vision. "
CHRNA2 ,cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 2 subunit,"The CHRNA2 gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of a larger protein called a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Each nAChR protein is made up of a combination of five subunits, usually two alpha (α) and three beta (β) subunits. Many different combinations are possible, and the characteristics of each nAChR protein depend on which subunits it contains. The CHRNA2 gene is responsible for producing a subunit known as α2. Little is known about the specific function of nAChR proteins made with this subunit.In the brain, nAChR proteins are widely distributed and play an important role in chemical signaling between nerve cells (neurons). The proteins act as channels, allowing charged atoms (ions) including calcium, sodium, and potassium to cross the cell membrane. These channels open when attached to a brain chemical (neurotransmitter) called acetylcholine. The channels also open in response to nicotine, the addictive substance in tobacco.Communication between neurons depends on neurotransmitters, which are released from one neuron and taken up by neighboring neurons. The release and uptake of these chemicals are tightly regulated to ensure that signals are passed efficiently and accurately between neurons. Researchers believe that nAChR channels play an important role in controlling the normal release and uptake of neurotransmitters.A wide range of brain functions depend on nAChR channels, including sleep and arousal, fatigue, anxiety, attention, pain perception, and memory. The channels are also active before birth, which suggests that they are involved in early brain development. At least one drug that targets nAChR channels in the brain has been developed to help people quit smoking; other medications targeting these channels are under study for the treatment of schizophrenia, Alzheimer disease, and pain.","Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy At least one mutation in the CHRNA2 gene has been found to cause autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE). It appears that changes in this gene are a very rare cause of ADNFLE. Some researchers suspect that the known mutation actually causes a separate form of epilepsy with features similar to ADNFLE.The identified CHRNA2 mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the α2 subunit of nAChR channels. Specifically, it replaces the amino acid isoleucine with the amino acid asparagine at protein position 279 (written as Ile279Asn or I279N). This mutation makes the channels more sensitive to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, allowing them to open more easily than usual. The resulting increase in ion flow across the cell membrane alters the release of neurotransmitters, which changes signaling between neurons. Researchers believe that the overexcitement of certain neurons in the brain triggers the abnormal brain activity associated with seizures. It is unclear why the seizures seen in ADNFLE start in the frontal lobes of the brain and occur most often during sleep. "
CHRNA4 ,cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 4 subunit,"The CHRNA4 gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of a larger protein called a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Each nAChR protein is made up of a combination of five subunits, usually two alpha (α) and three beta (β) subunits. Many different combinations are possible, and the characteristics of each nAChR protein depend on which subunits it contains. In the brain, nAChR proteins most commonly consist of two α4 subunits and three β2 subunits. The CHRNA4 gene is responsible for producing the α4 subunit.In the brain, nAChR proteins are widely distributed and play an important role in chemical signaling between nerve cells (neurons).

At least one drug that targets nAChR channels in the brain has been developed to help people quit smoking; other medications targeting these channels are under study for the treatment of schizophrenia, Alzheimer disease, and pain.","Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy At least four mutations in the CHRNA4 gene have been identified in people with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE). Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the α4 subunit of nAChR channels; one mutation inserts an extra amino acid into the α4 subunit.CHRNA4 mutations make nAChR channels more sensitive to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, allowing the channels to open more easily than usual. The resulting increase in ion flow across the cell membrane alters the release of neurotransmitters, which changes signaling between neurons. Researchers believe that the overexcitement of certain neurons in the brain triggers the abnormal brain activity associated with seizures. It is unclear why the seizures seen in ADNFLE start in the frontal lobes of the brain and occur most often during sleep. "
CHRNB2 ,cholinergic receptor nicotinic beta 2 subunit,"The CHRNB2 gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of a larger protein called a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Each nAChR protein is made up of a combination of five subunits, usually two alpha (α) and three beta (β) subunits.

It is unclear why the seizures seen in ADNFLE start in the frontal lobes of the brain and occur most often during sleep. "
CHRNE ,cholinergic receptor nicotinic epsilon subunit,"The CHRNE gene provides instructions for making the epsilon (ε) component (subunit) of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) protein. The AChR protein is found in the membrane of skeletal muscle cells and plays a critical role in the neuromuscular junction, which is the area where signaling between nerve and muscle cells occurs. Signaling between nerve and muscle cells is necessary for movement. The AChR protein consists of five subunits, each of which is produced from a different gene. The subunits are assembled into the AChR protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, a cell structure involved in protein processing and transport, before being transported to the cell membrane. There are two major forms of the AChR protein, a fetal type that is present before birth and an adult type. The ε subunit is found only in the adult AChR protein. At about the 33rd week of pregnancy, the ε subunit replaces the gamma (γ) subunit (found only in fetal AChR) to form adult AChR protein.","Congenital myasthenic syndrome More than 90 mutations in the CHRNE gene have been found to cause congenital myasthenic syndrome. Most of these mutations replace one DNA building block (nucleotide) in the gene, but other mutations add or delete small sections of DNA. These mutations can lead to the production of an altered ε subunit. A change in the ε subunit leads to an increase in AChR protein signaling or a decrease in AChR protein signaling, which impairs cell-to-cell communication at the neuromuscular junction. Decreased signaling can lead to a decrease in muscle movement and cause weakness, while an increase in signaling can damage muscle cells and cause weakness. Problems with communication between nerve and muscle cells can lead to the signs and symptoms of congenital myasthenic syndrome, including muscle weakness and delayed development of motor skills such as crawling and walking. Some people with CHRNE mutations seem to have a milder course of the disease compared with other affected individuals, likely because the fetal γ subunit (active at low levels after birth) can partially compensate for the lack of ε subunit in the adult AChR protein.

CHRNG ,cholinergic receptor nicotinic gamma subunit,"The CHRNG gene provides instructions for making the gamma (γ) protein component (subunit) of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) protein. The AChR protein is found in the membrane of skeletal muscle cells and is critical for signaling between nerve and muscle cells. Signaling between these cells is necessary for movement. The AChR protein consists of five subunits, each of which is produced from a different gene. The subunits are assembled into the AChR protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, a cell structure involved in protein processing and transport, before being transported to the cell membrane. The γ subunit is found only in the fetal AChR protein. At about the thirty-third week of pregnancy, the γ subunit is replaced by the epsilon (ε) subunit, which is produced by the CHRNE gene, to form the adult AChR protein.","Multiple pterygium syndrome At least 14 mutations in the CHRNG gene have been found to cause multiple pterygium syndrome, a condition characterized by webbing of the skin (pterygium) and a lack of muscle movement (akinesia) before birth. These mutations include replacing, adding, or deleting DNA building blocks (nucleotides). CHRNG gene mutations result in an impaired or missing γ subunit. The severity of the CHRNG gene mutation influences the severity of the condition. Typically, mutations that prevent the production of any γ subunit will result in lethal multiple pterygium syndrome, which is fatal before birth, while mutations that allow the production of some γ subunit will lead to the milder form of this condition called multiple pterygium syndrome, Escobar type. A shortage of a functional γ subunit prevents the fetal AChR protein from being assembled or properly placed in the muscle cell membrane. As a result, the fetal AChR protein cannot function and the communication between nerve and muscle cells in the developing fetus is impaired. A lack of signaling between nerve and muscle cells leads to akinesia and pterygium before birth, and many of the other signs and symptoms of multiple pterygium syndrome. "
CHST3 ,carbohydrate sulfotransferase 3,"The CHST3 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase 1 or C6ST-1. This enzyme has an important role in the development and maintenance of the skeleton. In particular, it is essential for the normal development of cartilage, which is a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears.The C6ST-1 enzyme modifies molecules called chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, which are abundant in cartilage and give this tissue its rubbery, gel-like consistency. The C6ST-1 enzyme carries out a process known as sulfation, in which a chemical group called a sulfate is transferred from one chemical compound to another. Specifically, the enzyme takes sulfate from a molecule called 3'-phosphoadenyl-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) and adds it to a specific location on chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Sulfation of these molecules is a critical step in cartilage formation.","CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia At least 24 mutations in the CHST3 gene have been found to cause CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia, a condition characterized by progressive bone and joint abnormalities. Most of the mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the C6ST-1 enzyme. Other mutations result in the production of an abnormally short version of the enzyme. Each of these genetic changes reduces or eliminates the activity of C6ST-1, preventing it from transferring sulfate groups to chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Defective sulfation of these molecules disrupts the normal development of cartilage and bone, resulting in short stature, joint dislocations, and the other features of CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia. "
CIITA ,class II major histocompatibility complex transactivator,"The CIITA gene provides instructions for making a protein that primarily helps control the activity (transcription) of genes called major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes. Transcription is the first step in the production of proteins, and CIITA is critical for the production of specialized immune proteins called MHC class II proteins from these genes. The CIITA protein coordinates various proteins to turn on MHC class II gene transcription and allow the production of MHC class II proteins.MHC class II proteins are found on the surface of several types of immune cells, including white blood cells (lymphocytes) that are involved in immune reactions. These proteins play an important role in the body's immune response to foreign invaders, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. To help the body recognize and fight infections, MHC class II proteins bind to fragments of proteins (peptides) from foreign invaders so that other specialized immune system cells can interact with them. When these immune system cells recognize the peptides as harmful, they trigger the lymphocytes and other immune cells to launch immune responses to get rid of the foreign invaders.The CIITA protein also appears to play a role in enhancing the transcription of MHC class I genes, which provide instructions for making immune system proteins called MHC class I proteins. Like MHC class II proteins, MHC class I proteins attach to peptides from foreign invaders and present them to specific immune system cells. These cells then attack the foreign invaders to rid them from the body. While the CIITA protein is able to help promote MHC class I gene activity, it is not the primary regulator of these genes. Other proteins play a more prominent role in their transcription.","Bare lymphocyte syndrome type II More than a dozen mutations in the CIITA gene have been found to cause an immune system disorder called bare lymphocyte syndrome type II (BLS II). BLS II is a type of combined immunodeficiency (CID), in which affected individuals have virtually no immune protection from foreign invaders. Consequently, individuals with BLS II have persistent infections in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary tracts, which can be life-threatening.CIITA gene mutations involved in BLS II result in a lack of functioning CIITA protein. A shortage of CIITA to coordinate the factors that turn on MHC class II gene transcription prevents production of MHC class II proteins. Consequently, lymphocytes and other immune cells lack any MHC class II proteins on their surface, and the body has difficulty getting rid of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, leading to the persistent infections characteristic of BLS II. "
CISD2 ,CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2,"The CISD2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in the outer membrane of cell structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria are involved in a wide variety of cellular activities, including energy production, chemical signaling, and regulation of cell growth and division. The exact function of the CISD2 protein is unknown, but it is thought to help keep mitochondria functioning normally.","Wolfram syndrome At least one mutation in the CISD2 gene has been found to cause Wolfram syndrome. This condition is characterized by a lack of insulin leading to increased blood sugar (diabetes mellitus), a degeneration of nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain (optic atrophy), and a number of other features involving the urinary tract, the brain, and hearing. People with this CISD2 gene mutation also experience gastrointestinal ulcers and excessive bleeding after injury.The CISD2 gene mutation that causes Wolfram syndrome replaces the amino acid glutamic acid with the amino acid glutamine at position 37 in the CISD2 protein (written as Glu37Gln or E37Q). This mutation results in an abnormally small, nonfunctional CISD2 protein. As a result, the function of the mitochondria is impaired and they eventually break down. Since the mitochondria provide energy to cells, the loss of mitochondria leads to decreased energy for cells. Cells that do not have enough energy to function will eventually die. Cells with high energy demands, such as nerve cells in the brain, eyes, or gastrointestinal tract, are most susceptible to cell death due to reduced energy. The gradual loss of cells in various body systems likely causes the signs and symptoms of Wolfram syndrome. When Wolfram syndrome is caused by CISD2 gene mutations, it is sometimes referred to as Wolfram syndrome type 2. "
CLCF1 ,cardiotrophin like cytokine factor 1,"The CLCF1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1). This protein partners with a similar protein called cytokine receptor-like factor 1 (CRLF1), which is produced from the CRLF1 gene. Together, these two proteins form a unit known as the CRLF1/CLCF1 protein complex. This complex attaches (binds) to a receptor protein known as the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) on the surface of many types of cells. When the CRLF1/CLCF1 protein complex is bound to CNTFR, it triggers signaling inside the cell that affects cell development and function.The CNTFR signaling pathway is primarily involved in the development and maintenance of the nervous system. It promotes the survival of nerve cells (neurons), particularly nerve cells that control muscle movement (motor neurons). The CNTFR pathway also plays a role in a part of the nervous system called the sympathetic nervous system, specifically in the regulation of sweating in response to temperature changes and other factors. This signaling pathway appears to be critical for the normal development and maturation of nerve cells that control the activity of sweat glands.Studies suggest that the CNTFR signaling pathway also has functions outside the nervous system. It may be involved in the body's inflammatory response, which helps fight infection and facilitate tissue repair following an injury. This pathway may also be important for the development and maintenance of bone tissue. However, little is known about the role of CNTFR signaling in these processes.","Cold-induced sweating syndrome At least four mutations in the CLCF1 gene have been reported to cause cold-induced sweating syndrome, a rare condition characterized by problems with regulating body temperature and other abnormalities affecting many parts of the body. When this condition is caused by CLCF1 gene mutations, it is known as CISS2.Mutations in the CLCF1 gene lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of the CLCF1 protein. The defective protein is unable to interact with the CLRF1 protein and bind to CNTFR, which disables the CNTFR signaling pathway.Researchers believe that a failure of CNTFR signaling underlies the major features of cold-induced sweating syndrome. A loss of this signaling pathway during sympathetic nervous system development may help explain the abnormal sweating that is characteristic of this condition, including unusual sweating patterns and related problems with body temperature regulation. The CNTFR pathway's involvement in motor neuron development and bone development provides clues to some of the other signs and symptoms of the disorder, including distinctive facial features, facial muscle weakness, and skeletal abnormalities. However, little is known about how a lack of CNTFR signaling leads to these varied features. "
CLCN1 ,chloride voltage-gated channel 1,"The CLCN1 gene provides instructions for making a type of protein called a chloride channel. These channels, which transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions), play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.The CLCN1 gene provides instructions for making a chloride channel called ClC-1. These channels are found only in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For the body to move normally, skeletal muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. Muscle contraction and relaxation are controlled by the flow of certain ions into and out of muscle cells. ClC-1 channels, which span the cell membrane, control the flow of chloride ions into these cells. This influx stabilizes the cells' electrical charge, which prevents muscles from contracting abnormally.ClC-1 channels are made of two identical protein subunits, each produced from the CLCN1 gene. Although each subunit forms a separate opening (pore) that allows chloride ions to pass through, the two proteins work together to regulate the flow of chloride ions into skeletal muscle cells.","Myotonia congenita More than 150 mutations in the CLCN1 gene have been identified in people with myotonia congenita. Most of these mutations cause the autosomal recessive form of the disorder, which is known as Becker disease. Autosomal recessive inheritance means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. Becker disease results when CLCN1 mutations change the structure or function of both protein subunits that make up the ClC-1 channel. The altered channels greatly reduce the flow of chloride ions into skeletal muscle cells, which triggers prolonged muscle contractions. Abnormally sustained muscle contractions are the hallmark of myotonia.CLCN1 mutations also cause the autosomal dominant form of myotonia congenita, which is known as Thomsen disease. Autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Studies suggest that the CLCN1 mutations responsible for Thomsen disease change one of the two protein subunits that make up the ClC-1 channel. The altered protein takes on new, but harmful, properties that disrupt the ability of both subunits to regulate chloride ion flow. Reduced movement of chloride ions into skeletal muscle cells leads to myotonia, which underlies the stiffness and other muscle problems in people with myotonia congenita.Because several CLCN1 mutations can cause either Becker disease or Thomsen disease, doctors usually rely on characteristic signs and symptoms to distinguish the two forms of myotonia congenita. "
CLCN2 ,chloride voltage-gated channel 2,"The CLCN2 gene belongs to the CLC family of genes, which provide instructions for making chloride channels. These channels, which transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions), play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. Some chloride channels regulate the flow of chloride ions across cell membranes, while others transport chloride ions within cells.The CLCN2 gene provides instructions for making a chloride channel called ClC-2. These channels are embedded within the outer membrane of most cells, and they transport chloride ions in and out of cells. The channel's function is thought to be particularly important in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. The ClC-2 channel regulates the size (volume) of neurons by playing a role in the intake and release of water as well as maintaining a normal balance of ions in cells.","CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy At least 18 mutations in the CLCN2 gene have been found to cause CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy. This condition is characterized primarily by problems with coordination and balance (ataxia) but can also cause learning disabilities, frequent headaches, and vision problems.Some CLCN2 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ClC-2 channel, impairing the stability of the channel and reducing channel function. Other CLCN2 gene mutations result in a complete loss of channel function, typically by leading to the production of an abnormally short channel protein. A shortened protein is either trapped inside the cell and cannot get to the cell membrane or is quickly broken down.As a result of this reduction in ClC-2 channel activity, certain brain cells and the myelin that surrounds neurons become filled with too much water and cannot function properly. Fluid-filled myelin cannot transmit nerve impulses effectively, resulting in neurological problems such as ataxia and the other signs and symptoms of CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy. "
CLCN5 ,chloride voltage-gated channel 5,"The CLCN5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ClC-5 that transports charged atoms (ions) across cell membranes. Specifically, ClC-5 exchanges negatively charged atoms of chlorine (chloride ions) for positively charged atoms of hydrogen (protons or hydrogen ions). Based on this function, ClC-5 is known as a H+/Cl- exchanger.ClC-5 is found primarily in the kidneys, particularly in structures called proximal tubules. These structures help to reabsorb nutrients, water, and other materials that have been filtered from the bloodstream. The kidneys reabsorb needed materials into the blood and excrete everything else into the urine.Within proximal tubule cells, ClC-5 is embedded in specialized compartments called endosomes. Endosomes are formed at the cell surface to carry proteins and other molecules to their destinations within the cell. ClC-5 transports hydrogen ions into endosomes and chloride ions out, which helps these compartments maintain the proper acidity level (pH). Endosomal pH levels must be tightly regulated for proximal tubule cells to function properly.","Dent disease About 150 mutations in the CLCN5 gene have been found to cause Dent disease 1, a chronic kidney disorder that can cause kidney failure. Most of the mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of ClC-5 or prevent cells from producing any of this protein. A loss of ClC-5 alters the regulation of endosomal pH, which disrupts the overall function of proximal tubule cells and prevents them from reabsorbing proteins and other materials into the bloodstream. As a result, proteins are lost through the urine (tubular proteinuria). A failure to reabsorb calcium and other nutrients into the bloodstream can cause bone defects, kidney stones, and related health problems in people with Dent disease 1. Abnormal proximal tubule function ultimately leads to kidney failure in most affected individuals. "
CLCN7 ,chloride voltage-gated channel 7,"The CLCN7 gene belongs to the CLC family of genes, which provide instructions for making chloride channels. These channels, which transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions), play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. Some CLC channels regulate the flow of chloride ions across cell membranes, while others transport chloride ions within cells.The CLCN7 gene provides instructions for making a chloride channel called ClC-7. These channels are abundant in cells throughout the body. They are particularly important for the normal function of osteoclasts, which are specialized cells that break down bone tissue. Osteoclasts are involved in bone remodeling, a normal process in which old bone is removed and new bone is created to replace it. Bones are constantly being remodeled, and the process is carefully controlled to ensure that bones stay strong and healthy.ClC-7 channels help regulate the relative acidity (pH) of osteoclasts. These channels transport two negatively charged chloride ions out of these cells for every positively charged hydrogen atom (hydrogen ion) that flows in. In this way, ClC-7 channels help balance the acidic environment that osteoclasts use to dissolve bone tissue. The pH inside and outside osteoclasts must be carefully controlled for these cells to break down bone effectively.","Osteopetrosis More than 50 mutations in the CLCN7 gene have been identified in people with osteopetrosis. Mutations in this gene can cause several different forms of the disorder: autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO), which is the most severe form; autosomal dominant osteopetrosis (ADO), which tends to be milder; and a moderate form known as intermediate autosomal osteopetrosis (IAO).Mutations in the CLCN7 gene impair the function of ClC-7 channels. The defective channels cannot transport chloride ions effectively, which disrupts the regulation of pH in osteoclasts. As a result, osteoclasts are unable to break down bone normally. When old bone is not broken down as new bone is formed, bones throughout the skeleton become unusually dense. The bones are also structurally abnormal, making them prone to fracture. These problems with bone remodeling underlie all of the major forms of osteopetrosis. "
CLCNKA ,chloride voltage-gated channel Ka,"The CLCNKA gene belongs to the CLC family of genes, which provide instructions for making chloride channels. These channels, which transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions), play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. Some CLC channels regulate the flow of chloride ions across cell membranes, while others transport chloride ions within cells.The CLCNKA gene provides instructions for making a chloride channel called ClC-Ka. These channels are found predominantly in the kidneys. ClC-Ka is one of several proteins that work together to regulate the movement of ions into and out of kidney cells. The transport of chloride ions by ClC-Ka channels is part of the mechanism by which the kidneys reabsorb salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) from the urine back into the bloodstream. The retention of salt affects the body's fluid levels and helps maintain blood pressure.ClC-Ka channels are also located in the inner ear, where they play a role in normal hearing.","Bartter syndrome Several people with Bartter syndrome have had mutations in both the CLCNKA gene and a closely related gene called CLCNKB. The CLCNKB gene provides instructions for making a very similar chloride channel, ClC-Kb, that is also found in the kidneys and inner ear. A combination of CLCNKA and CLCNKB gene mutations causes a life-threatening form of the disorder called Bartter syndrome type IV. This condition is also known as antenatal Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness because affected individuals have hearing loss caused by abnormalities in the inner ear.Mutations in the CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes prevent the ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb channels from transporting chloride ions in the kidneys. As a result, the kidneys cannot reabsorb salt normally and excess salt is lost through the urine (salt wasting). The abnormal salt loss disrupts the normal balance of ions in the body. This imbalance underlies many of the major features of Bartter syndrome, including a failure to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive), dehydration, constipation, and increased urine production (polyuria). A loss of ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb function in the inner ear is responsible for the hearing loss characteristic of Bartter syndrome type IV. "
CLCNKB ,chloride voltage-gated channel Kb,"The CLCNKB gene belongs to the CLC family of genes, which provide instructions for making chloride channels. These channels, which transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions), play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. Some CLC channels regulate the flow of chloride ions across cell membranes, while others transport chloride ions within cells.The CLCNKB gene provides instructions for making a chloride channel called ClC-Kb. These channels are found predominantly in the kidneys. ClC-Kb is one of several proteins that work together to regulate the movement of ions into and out of kidney cells. The transport of chloride ions by ClC-Kb channels is part of the mechanism by which the kidneys reabsorb salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) from the urine back into the bloodstream. The retention of salt affects the body's fluid levels and helps maintain blood pressure.ClC-Kb channels are also located in the inner ear, where they play a role in normal hearing.","Bartter syndrome More than 30 mutations in the CLCNKB gene have been identified in people with Bartter syndrome type III. This form of the condition, which is also described as classical Bartter syndrome, begins in childhood and tends to be less severe than other types of Bartter syndrome.Many of the mutations responsible for Bartter syndrome type III delete the entire CLCNKB gene. Other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ClC-Kb channel or lead to an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of ClC-Kb. A loss of functional ClC-Kb channels impairs the transport of chloride ions in the kidneys. As a result, the kidneys cannot reabsorb salt normally and excess salt is lost through the urine (salt wasting). The abnormal salt loss disrupts the normal balance of ions in the body. This imbalance underlies many of the major features of Bartter syndrome type III.Several people with a more severe form of Bartter syndrome have had mutations in both the CLCNKB gene and a closely related gene called CLCNKA. The CLCNKA gene provides instructions for making a very similar chloride channel, ClC-Ka, that is also found in the kidneys and inner ear. A combination of CLCNKA and CLCNKB gene mutations causes a life-threatening form of the disorder known as Bartter syndrome type IV or antenatal Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness. In addition to salt wasting, this form of the disorder is characterized by hearing loss that results from a loss of ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb function in the inner ear. "
CLIP2 ,CAP-Gly domain containing linker protein 2,"The CLIP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called CAP-Gly domain containing linker protein 2. The protein is also known as CLIP-115. This protein is found predominantly in the brain, where it likely plays a role in the normal structure and function of nerve cells. Within cells, this protein is thought to regulate aspects of the cytoskeleton, the structural framework that helps to determine cell shape, size, and movement. The protein is associated with microtubules, which are rigid, hollow fibers that make up a significant part of the cytoskeleton. Microtubules help cells maintain their shape, assist in the process of cell division, and are essential for the transport of materials within cells.","Williams syndrome The CLIP2 gene is located in a region of chromosome 7 that is deleted in people with Williams syndrome. As a result of this deletion, people with this condition are missing one copy of the CLIP2 gene in each cell. Studies suggest that the loss of this gene may contribute to some of the characteristic features of Williams syndrome, including the unique behavioral traits and other symptoms involving the nervous system. A deletion of this gene probably disrupts the normal regulation of the cytoskeleton and affects the structure of nerve cells in the brain. It is not known how these changes may be related to the characteristic signs and symptoms of Williams syndrome. "
CLN3 ,"CLN3, battenin","The CLN3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in tissues throughout the body, yet its function is unclear. The CLN3 protein is found in many compartments within cells, but its role in lysosomes is most well-studied. Lysosomes are cellular compartments that digest and recycle different types of molecules. The CLN3 protein spans the membrane surrounding lysosomes, helping to facilitate communication between it and the rest of the cell.Studies have associated the CLN3 protein with many cellular processes, including recycling of worn-out cell parts and unneeded proteins (autophagy), maintenance of the relative acidity (pH) of lysosomes, the movement of molecules from the cell surface into the cell (endocytosis), transportation (trafficking) of proteins to where they are needed in the cell, self-destruction of cells (apoptosis), cell growth and division (proliferation), and maintenance of the body's water balance (osmoregulation). It is uncertain which of these varied functions is the primary role of the CLN3 protein, or if these processes instead represent downstream effects.","CLN3 disease More than 65 mutations in the CLN3 gene have been found to cause CLN3 disease. CLN3 disease is an inherited disorder that begins in childhood and primarily affects the nervous system. People with this condition develop worsening vision impairment, intellectual disability, movement problems, speech difficulties, and seizures.One CLN3 gene mutation, found in more than 90 percent of cases, deletes about 1,000 DNA building blocks (base pairs) in the gene. This mutation, which is usually called the 1 kilobase (kb) deletion, often occurs in both copies of the CLN3 gene. The 1 kb deletion removes a piece of the CLN3 gene and leads to the production of an abnormally short protein. As a result, the amount of normal CLN3 protein is severely reduced. Other mutations reduce the amount of normal protein or impair its function. It is not known how loss of this protein causes the signs and symptoms of CLN3 disease.CLN3 disease is characterized by the accumulation of proteins and other substances in lysosomes. These accumulations occur in cells throughout the body; however, nerve cells seem to be particularly vulnerable to their effects. The accumulations can cause cell damage leading to cell death. The progressive death of nerve cells in the brain and other tissues leads to the neurological signs and symptoms of CLN3 disease. However, it is unclear how mutations in the CLN3 gene are involved in the buildup of substances in lysosomes. "
CLN5 ,"CLN5, intracellular trafficking protein","The CLN5 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not well understood. Cells produce a CLN5 protein that is inactive and contains extra protein segments. This inactive protein is called a preprotein. For the CLN5 preprotein to become active, the additional segments must be removed, followed by additional processing steps. The active CLN5 protein is then transported to cell compartments called lysosomes, which digest and recycle different types of molecules. Research suggests that the CLN5 protein may play a role in the process by which lysosomes break down or recycle damaged or unneeded proteins within cells.","CLN5 disease At least 35 mutations in the CLN5 gene have been found to cause CLN5 disease. This condition impairs mental and motor development causing difficulty with walking and intellectual function. In addition, affected children often develop recurrent seizures (epilepsy) and vision loss. Signs and symptoms of CLN5 disease typically appear around age 5 but can begin in adolescence or adulthood.Most of the mutations that cause CLN5 disease make changes in the CLN5 protein that interfere with the processing of the preprotein or alter the structure of the protein. The resulting proteins cannot be transported to the lysosomes. Other mutations lead to production of abnormal proteins that are quickly broken down. One such mutation, known as Finmajor, is responsible for almost all cases of CLN5 disease in people of Finnish descent. The Finmajor mutation replaces the protein building block (amino acid) tyrosine with a signal to stop protein production prematurely (written as Tyr392Ter or Y392X).A lack of functional CLN5 protein within lysosomes probably impairs the breakdown of certain proteins, which then likely accumulate in cells throughout the body. While these accumulations can damage any cells, nerve cells appear to be particularly vulnerable. Widespread loss of nerve cells in CLN5 disease leads to severe signs and symptoms and early death.In the cases in which CLN5 disease develops in adolescence or adulthood, it is thought that the CLN5 gene mutations lead to a CLN5 protein with reduced function that is broken down earlier than normal. Because the altered CLN5 protein can function for a small amount of time, some damaged or unneeded proteins may be broken down in lysosomes. Since it takes longer for these substances to accumulate and cause nerve cell death, the signs and symptoms of CLN5 disease in these individuals occur later in life. "
CLN6 ,"CLN6, transmembrane ER protein","The CLN6 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not well understood. Within cells, the CLN6 protein is found in a structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein processing and transport. Research suggests that the CLN6 protein regulates the transportation of certain proteins and fats from the endoplasmic reticulum to lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments in the cell that digest and recycle materials. Based on this function, the CLN6 protein appears to help cells get rid of materials they no longer need.","CLN6 disease More than 70 mutations in the CLN6 gene have been found to cause CLN6 disease. This condition impairs motor and mental development, typically starting in early to late childhood, causing gradually worsening problems with movement and a decline in intellectual function. In some cases, signs and symptoms of CLN6 disease do not appear until adulthood.Most CLN6 gene mutations result in the production of an abnormal CLN6 protein that is quickly broken down (degraded). As a result, there is a severe reduction in the amount of functional CLN6 protein in cells. While it is not known how the loss of this protein causes the signs and symptoms of CLN6 disease, it is likely that the protein's quick degradation contributes to the childhood onset of CLN6 disease.In the cases in which CLN6 disease develops in adulthood, CLN6 gene mutations often change single protein building blocks (amino acids), resulting in a CLN6 protein with reduced function. Research suggests that these CLN6 gene mutations allow enough functional protein to be produced so that signs and symptoms of the disorder do not develop until later in life.CLN6 disease is characterized by the accumulation of proteins or peptides and other substances in lysosomes. These accumulations occur in cells throughout the body; however, nerve cells seem to be particularly vulnerable to their effects. The accumulations can cause cell damage leading to cell death. The progressive death of nerve cells in the brain and other tissues leads to the signs and symptoms of CLN6 disease. However, it is unclear how mutations in the CLN6 gene are involved in the buildup of substances in lysosomes in CLN6 disease. These accumulations occur in more cells throughout the body in children with CLN6 disease than in affected adults. "
CLN8 ,"CLN8, transmembrane ER and ERGIC protein","The CLN8 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose precise function is not known but that is thought to play a transport role within cells. Specifically, the CLN8 protein likely helps to move materials in and out of a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein production, processing, and transport. The CLN8 protein may also play a role in helping the endoplasmic reticulum regulate levels of fats (lipids) in cells. In certain cells, including nerve cells, the CLN8 protein is thought to be active outside of the endoplasmic reticulum, but its function is unknown.","CLN8 disease At least 25 mutations in the CLN8 gene have been found to cause CLN8 disease. CLN8 disease is an inherited disorder that varies in severity and primarily affects the nervous system. The less-severe form of CLN8 disease is characterized by recurrent seizures (epilepsy) and a decline in intellectual function that begins between ages 5 and 10. Individuals with the less-severe form of CLN8 disease often live into late adulthood. People with the more-severe form of CLN8 disease experience a gradual worsening of motor and cognitive skills, epilepsy, and vision loss. In this form, signs and symptoms typically appear between ages 2 and 7. Individuals with the more-severe form of CLN8 disease usually survive only into late childhood or adolescence.A specific mutation that replaces the protein building block (amino acid) arginine with the amino acid glycine at position 26 in the CLN8 protein (written as Arg26Gly or R26G) is found in all individuals from a northern region of Finland who have the less-severe form of CLN8 disease. This mutation probably leads to production of a protein with reduced function. Because there is likely still some normal function of the CLN8 protein, features of this form are less severe compared to other cases of CLN8 disease. Affected individuals have a reduction in the levels of certain lipids in the brain, likely due to a decrease in CLN8 protein activity, but the effects of this reduction are unclear. Individuals with this form of CLN8 disease have mild brain abnormalities resulting from nerve cell death in the brain, but the cause of this cell death is unknown.Some CLN8 gene mutations that cause the more-severe form of CLN8 disease likely drastically reduce the function of the CLN8 protein. Other mutations likely impair transport of the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum, so that it cannot perform its function. It is unclear how a loss or reduction of CLN8 protein leads to the signs and symptoms of CLN8 disease. In the more-severe form of CLN8 disease, proteins and other substances accumulate in cell structures called lysosomes. While accumulations of these substances occur in cells throughout the body, nerve cells appear to be particularly vulnerable to damage caused by the abnormal cell materials; however, it is unclear how mutations in the CLN8 gene are involved in this buildup. Widespread loss of nerve cells in CLN8 disease leads to the neurological signs and symptoms and, in the case of the more-severe form, early death. "
CLPB ,"ClpB homolog, mitochondrial AAA ATPase chaperonin","The CLPB gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. The CLPB protein is found in cells throughout the body but is most abundant in the brain. Based on its similarity to a protein in other organisms, researchers speculate that the CLPB protein helps unfold misfolded proteins so they can be refolded correctly. When misfolded, proteins cannot function properly and may be damaging to cells.","CLPB deficiency At least 20 CLPB gene mutations have been found to cause CLPB deficiency. This condition is characterized by neurological problems, including movement abnormalities and seizures; a shortage of white blood cells (neutropenia), which can increase the risk of infections; and clouding of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts). In addition, affected individuals have an increased amount of a molecule called 3-methylglutaconic acid in their urine, which does not appear to cause health problems. The severity of these features varies widely. Many of the CLPB gene mutations lead to an abnormally short CLPB protein that is likely broken down quickly. Other mutations may reduce CLPB's function. The severity of the condition is thought to be related to the amount of functional protein remaining: severe CLPB deficiency is likely caused by a complete absence of CLPB protein, while moderate and mild CLPB deficiency result when some functional CLPB protein is produced. Researchers are unsure how reduction or absence of this protein leads to the signs and symptoms of CLPB deficiency. "
CLPP ,caseinolytic mitochondrial matrix peptidase proteolytic subunit,"The CLPP gene provides instructions for making the ClpP subunit protein. Multiple copies of this protein interact with each other to form a barrel-shaped chamber known as the ClpP complex. This complex is one of two parts of the ClpXP protease, which breaks down abnormally folded proteins. The other part of the ClpXP protease, called the ClpX complex, unfolds the abnormal proteins and feeds them into the chamber formed by the ClpP complex, where they are broken down into small fragments.The ClpP complex is found in structures in the cell called mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers of cells.","Perrault syndrome At least three mutations in the CLPP gene have been found in families with Perrault syndrome, a condition characterized by hearing loss in affected males and females and abnormalities of the ovaries in affected females. The CLPP gene mutations involved in Perrault syndrome likely alter the structure of the barrel-shaped chamber formed by the ClpP complex. These changes may impair the breakdown of misfolded mitochondrial proteins, which could impact mitochondrial function; however, it is unclear how these changes lead to the features of Perrault syndrome. "
CLRN1 ,clarin 1,"The CLRN1 gene provides information for making a protein called clarin 1. This protein is probably involved in normal hearing and vision. Clarin 1 has been found in several areas of the body, including sensory cells in the inner ear called hair cells. These cells help transmit sound and motion signals to the brain. This protein is also active in the retina, which is the light-sensing tissue that lines the back of the eye. Although the function of clarin 1 has not been determined, studies suggest that it plays a role in communication between nerve cells (neurons) in the inner ear and in the retina. Clarin 1 may be important for the development and function of synapses, which are junctions between neurons where cell-to-cell communication occurs.","Usher syndrome At least 15 mutations in the CLRN1 gene have been identified in people with Usher syndrome type III, which is characterized by a combination of hearing loss and vision loss. Some affected individuals also have problems with balance and coordination. CLRN1 gene mutations cause a form of the condition known as Usher syndrome type IIIA (USH3A). This form of Usher syndrome is rare in most countries, although it represents about 40 percent of all Usher syndrome cases in the Finnish population.Several CLRN1 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the clarin 1 protein. In some cases, these mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the protein or prevent the production of any functional clarin 1. Other mutations insert or delete small amounts of DNA in the CLRN1 gene, which probably impairs the normal function of the protein. It is unclear how a missing or altered clarin 1 protein leads to the signs and symptoms of Usher syndrome type IIIA.Two particular CLRN1 gene mutations are most common in families of Finnish ancestry. One mutation, sometimes called Finmajor and written as Tyr176Ter or Y176X, leads to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of clarin 1. The other mutation, written as Met120Lys or M120K and also known as Finminor, substitutes the amino acid lysine for the amino acid methionine at protein position 120. This mutation appears to disrupt the protein's normal function. "
CNBP ,CCHC-type zinc finger nucleic acid binding protein,"The CNBP gene (also known as ZNF9) provides instructions for making a protein called CCHC-type zinc finger nucleic acid binding protein. This protein has seven regions, called zinc finger domains, which are thought to attach (bind) to specific sites on DNA and its chemical cousin, RNA.The CNBP protein is found in many of the body's tissues, but it is most abundant in the heart and in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). Although the exact function of this protein is unclear, it appears to regulate the activity of other genes. The CNBP protein is necessary for normal embryonic development.One region of the CNBP gene contains a segment of four DNA building blocks (nucleotides) that is repeated multiple times. This sequence, which is written as CCTG, is called a tetranucleotide repeat. In most people, the CCTG sequence is repeated fewer than 26 times.","Myotonic dystrophy Type 2 myotonic dystrophy results from a mutation in the CNBP gene known as a tetranucleotide repeat expansion. This mutation increases the size of the repeated CCTG segment in the CNBP gene. People with type 2 myotonic dystrophy have from 75 to more than 11,000 CCTG repeats.The mutated CNBP gene produces an altered version of messenger RNA, which is a molecular blueprint of the gene that is normally used to guide the production of proteins. Researchers have found that the altered messenger RNA traps proteins to form clumps within the cell. The clumps interfere with the production of many other proteins. These changes prevent muscle cells and cells in other tissues from functioning properly, leading to muscle weakness and the other features of type 2 myotonic dystrophy. "
CNGA3 ,cyclic nucleotide gated channel alpha 3,"The CNGA3 gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha subunit) of the cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel. These channels are found exclusively in light-detecting (photoreceptor) cells called cones, which are located in a specialized tissue at the back of the eye known as the retina. Cones provide vision in bright light (daylight vision), including color vision. Other photoreceptor cells, called rods, provide vision in low light (night vision).CNG channels are openings in the cell membrane that transport positively charged atoms (cations) into cells. In cones, CNG channels remain open under dark conditions, allowing cations to flow in. When light enters the eye, it triggers the closure of these channels, stopping the inward flow of cations. This change in cation transport alters the cone's electrical charge, which ultimately generates a signal that is interpreted by the brain as vision. This process of translating light into an electrical signal is called phototransduction.","Achromatopsia More than 100 mutations in the CNGA3 gene have been found to cause the vision disorder achromatopsia. These mutations underlie about 25 percent of cases of complete achromatopsia, a form of the disorder characterized by a total lack of color vision and other vision problems that are present from early infancy. CNGA3 gene mutations have also been identified in a few individuals with incomplete achromatopsia, a milder form of the disorder associated with limited color vision.The CNGA3 gene mutations that underlie complete achromatopsia affect the production or function of the alpha subunit. In some cases, no protein is produced. In others, the protein is altered and does not function normally. CNG channels assembled without the alpha subunit or with an abnormal subunit are nonfunctional; they prevent cones from carrying out phototransduction. Researchers speculate that some defective channels allow a huge influx of cations into cones, which ultimately causes these cells to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). A loss of cone function underlies the lack of color vision and other vision problems in people with complete achromatopsia.A few mutations in the CNGA3 gene reduce but do not eliminate the function of CNG channels in cones. These mutations cause incomplete achromatopsia because the partially functioning cones can transmit some visual information to the brain.Because these CNG channels are specific to cones, rods are generally unaffected by this disorder. "
CNGB3 ,cyclic nucleotide gated channel beta 3,"The CNGB3 gene provides instructions for making one part (the beta subunit) of the cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel. These channels are found exclusively in light-detecting (photoreceptor) cells called cones, which are located in a specialized tissue at the back of the eye known as the retina. Cones provide vision in bright light (daylight vision), including color vision. Other photoreceptor cells, called rods, provide vision in low light (night vision).CNG channels are openings in the cell membrane that transport positively charged atoms (cations) into cells. In cones, CNG channels remain open under dark conditions, allowing cations to flow in. When light enters the eye, it triggers the closure of these channels, stopping the inward flow of cations. This change in cation transport alters the cone's electrical charge, which ultimately generates a signal that is interpreted by the brain as vision. This process of translating light into an electrical signal is called phototransduction.","Achromatopsia More than 40 mutations in the CNGB3 gene have been found to cause the vision disorder achromatopsia. These mutations cause 50 to 70 percent of cases of complete achromatopsia, a form of the disorder characterized by a total lack of color vision and other vision problems that are present from early infancy. Worldwide, the most common mutation that causes this condition deletes a single DNA building block (base pair) from the CNGB3 gene. This mutation can be written as 1148delC.Complete achromatopsia occurs frequently in Pingelapese islanders, who live on one of the Eastern Caroline Islands of Micronesia. Among the Pingelapese, this condition results from a mutation that changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the beta subunit. This mutation replaces the amino acid serine with the amino acid phenylalanine at position 435 in the protein (written as Ser435Phe or S435F).Most CNGB3 gene mutations prevent the production of any functional beta subunit, which alters the structure of CNG channels. The resulting channels are nonfunctional and prevent cones from carrying out phototransduction. Researchers speculate that the defective channels allow a huge influx of cations into cones, which ultimately causes these cells to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). A loss of cone function underlies the lack of color vision and other vision problems in people with complete achromatopsia.Because these CNG channels are specific to cones, rods are generally unaffected by this disorder. "
COG5 ,component of oligomeric golgi complex 5,"The COG5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called component of oligomeric Golgi complex 5 (COG5). As its name suggests, COG5 is one piece of a group of proteins known as the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex. This complex functions in the Golgi apparatus, which is a cell structure in which newly produced proteins are modified. One process that occurs in the Golgi apparatus is glycosylation, by which sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) are attached to proteins and fats. Glycosylation modifies proteins so they can perform a wider variety of functions.The COG complex takes part in the transport of proteins, including the enzymes that perform glycosylation, within the Golgi apparatus. COG is specifically involved in retrograde transport, which moves proteins backward through the Golgi apparatus. Retrograde transport is important for recycling Golgi proteins and ensuring that they are in the correct location in the structure, which is key to proper glycosylation. The proteins are transported in sac-like structures called vesicles that attach to the Golgi membrane and release the contents into the Golgi apparatus. The COG complex controls the attachment (tethering) of the vesicles to the Golgi membrane.","COG5-congenital disorder of glycosylation At least eight mutations in the COG5 gene are known to cause COG5-congenital disorder of glycosylation (COG5-CDG). This condition often leads to developmental delay and intellectual disability and causes other abnormalities. Mutations in the COG5 gene reduce the amount of COG5 protein or eliminate it completely, which disrupts retrograde transport in the Golgi apparatus. This disruption results in abnormal protein glycosylation, which can affect multiple body systems, leading to the signs and symptoms of COG5-CDG. The severity of the condition is related to the amount of COG5 protein that remains in cells. "
COL1A1 ,collagen type I alpha 1 chain,"The COL1A1 gene provides instructions for making part of a large molecule called type I collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support many tissues in the body, including cartilage, bone, tendon, skin, and the white part of the eye (the sclera). Type I collagen is the most abundant form of collagen in the human body.A component of type I collagen called the pro-α1(I) chain is produced from the COL1A1 gene. Collagens begin as rope-like procollagen molecules that are each made up of three chains. Type I collagen is composed of two pro-α1(I) chains and one pro-α2(I) chain (which is produced from the COL1A2 gene).The triple-stranded procollagen molecules are processed by enzymes in a series of steps inside and outside the cell to create mature collagen. The collagen molecules then arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils that form stable interactions (cross-links) with one another in the spaces between cells. The cross-links result in the formation of very strong type I collagen fibers.","Caffey disease A particular mutation in the COL1A1 gene causes infantile cortical hyperostosis, commonly known as Caffey disease. The signs and symptoms of Caffey disease are usually apparent by the time an infant is 5 months old. This condition is characterized by swelling of soft tissues (muscles, for example), pain, and excessive new bone formation (hyperostosis). The bone abnormalities mainly affect the jawbone, collarbones (clavicles), and the shafts (diaphyses) of long bones in the arms and legs. For unknown reasons, the pain and swelling associated with Caffey disease typically go away within a few months. Through a normal process called bone remodeling, which replaces old bone tissue with new bone, the excess bone is usually reabsorbed by the body and undetectable on x-ray images by the age of 2.The mutation that causes this condition occurs in one copy of the COL1A1 gene in each cell. It alters a single protein building block (amino acid), replacing the amino acid arginine with the amino acid cysteine at protein position 836 (written as Arg836Cys or R836C). This mutation results in the production of type I collagen fibrils that are variable in size and shape, but it is unknown how these changes lead to the signs and symptoms of Caffey disease. "
COL1A2 ,collagen type I alpha 2 chain,"The COL1A2 gene provides instructions for making part of a large molecule called type I collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support many tissues in the body, including cartilage, bone, tendon, skin, and the white part of the eye (the sclera). Type I collagen is the most abundant form of collagen in the human body.A component of type I collagen called the pro-α2(I) chain is produced from the COL1A2 gene. Collagens begin as rope-like procollagen molecules that are each made up of three chains. Type I collagen is composed of two pro-α1(I) chains (which are produced from the COL1A1 gene) and one pro-α2(I) chain.The triple-stranded procollagen molecules are processed by enzymes in a series of steps inside and outside the cell to create mature collagen. The collagen molecules then arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils that form stable interactions (cross-links) with one another in the spaces between cells. The cross-links result in the formation of very strong type I collagen fibers.","Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Several mutations in the COL1A2 gene can cause a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome known as the arthrochalasia type. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect the connective tissues that support the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues. The arthrochalasia type is characterized by an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility) and dislocations of both hips at birth. The genetic changes, which affect one copy of the COL1A2 gene in each cell, lead to the production of a pro-α2(I) chain that is missing a critical segment. The absence of this segment interferes with the assembly and processing of pro-α2(I) chains into mature type I collagen molecules. These changes mainly affect tissues that are rich in type I collagen, such as the skin, bones, and tendons.Rarely, mutations in both copies of the COL1A2 gene in each cell have been reported in people with a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome described as the cardiac-valvular type. This rare condition is characterized by abnormalities of the valves in the heart, highly stretchy (elastic) skin, and joint hypermobility. The mutations that cause this form of the disorder prevent cells from producing any normal pro-α2(I) chains. As a result, type I collagen fibrils in the skin and other tissues cannot be assembled correctly. The abnormal collagen weakens connective tissues, which causes the signs and symptoms of this condition. "
COL2A1 ,collagen type II alpha 1 chain,"The COL2A1 gene provides instructions for making one component of type II collagen, called the pro-alpha1(II) chain. Type II collagen adds structure and strength to the connective tissues that support the body's muscles, joints, organs, and skin. Type II collagen is found primarily in cartilage, a tough but flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears. Type II collagen is also part of the clear gel that fills the eyeball (the vitreous), the inner ear, and the center portion of the discs between the vertebrae in the spine (nucleus pulposus).To construct type II collagen, three pro-alpha1(II) chains twist together to form a triple-stranded, rope-like procollagen molecule. Procollagen molecules are then processed by enzymes in the cell. Once processed, the molecules leave the cell and arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils that link to one another (cross-link) in the spaces around cells. The cross-linkages result in the formation of very strong, mature type II collagen fibers.","Achondrogenesis At least 18 mutations in the COL2A1 gene have been found to cause a form of achondrogenesis known as type 2 or the Langer-Saldino type. This rare disorder of bone development is characterized by short arms and legs, a narrow chest with short ribs, underdeveloped lungs, and a lack of normal bone formation (ossification) in the spine and pelvis. Serious health problems result from these abnormalities, and infants with achondrogenesis usually die before or soon after birth.The mutations that cause achondrogenesis type 2 change one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make the pro-alpha1(II) chain. Specifically, the amino acid glycine is replaced with a different amino acid at one of various positions in this collagen chain. All of these mutations prevent the normal production of mature type II collagen, which results in the severe skeletal abnormalities seen in this disorder. "
COL3A1 ,collagen type III alpha 1 chain,"The COL3A1 gene provides instructions for making type III collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support many tissues in the body. Type III collagen is found in the skin, lungs, intestinal walls, and the walls of blood vessels.The components of type III collagen, called pro-α1(III) chains, are produced from the COL3A1 gene. Each molecule of type III procollagen is made up of three copies of this chain.The triple-stranded, rope-like procollagen molecules are processed by enzymes outside the cell to create mature type III collagen. The collagen molecules then arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils that form stable interactions (cross-links) with one another and with other types of collagen in the spaces between cells. The cross-links result in the formation of very strong collagen fibers.","Ehlers-Danlos syndrome More than 500 mutations in the COL3A1 gene have been found to cause a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome called the vascular type. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect the connective tissues that support the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues. The vascular type can cause potentially life-threatening complications, including tearing (rupture) of blood vessels, intestines, and other organs. The mutations that cause this form of the disorder alter the structure and production of type III procollagen molecules. As a result, a large percentage of type III collagen molecules are assembled incorrectly, or the amount of type III collagen is greatly reduced. Researchers believe that these changes affect tissues that are normally rich in this type of collagen, such as the skin, blood vessel walls, and internal organs. An insufficient amount of type III collagen weakens connective tissues in these parts of the body, causing the signs and symptoms of the vascular type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. "
COL4A1 ,collagen type IV alpha 1 chain,"The COL4A1 gene provides instructions for making one component of type IV collagen, which is a flexible protein important in the structure of many tissues throughout the body. Specifically, this gene makes the alpha1(IV) chain of type IV collagen. This chain combines with another alpha1 chain and a different type of alpha (IV) chain called alpha2 to make a complete type IV collagen alpha1-1-2 molecule. Type IV collagen molecules attach to each other to form complex protein networks. These protein networks are the main component of basement membranes, which are thin sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues. Type IV collagen alpha1-1-2 networks play an important role in the basement membranes in virtually all tissues throughout the body, particularly the basement membranes surrounding the body's blood vessels (vasculature). The type IV collagen network helps the basement membranes interact with nearby cells, playing a role in cell movement (migration), cell growth and division (proliferation), cell maturation (differentiation), and the survival of cells.","COL4A1-related brain small-vessel disease Mutations in the COL4A1 gene have been found to cause COL4A1-related brain small-vessel disease. This condition is part of a group of conditions called COL4A1-related disorders that have overlapping signs and symptoms involving fragile blood vessels. COL4A1-related brain small-vessel disease is characterized by stroke and eye abnormalities. Most of the identified COL4A1 gene mutations that cause COL4A1-related brain small-vessel disease change one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make the alpha1(IV) chain of type IV collagen. Specifically, the mutations replace the amino acid glycine with a different amino acid at one of various places in this collagen chain. The substitution of another amino acid for glycine in the alpha1(IV) chain prevents this chain from combining with other chains to form a complete type IV collagen molecule. This alteration in type IV collagen prevents protein networks from forming and basement membranes from developing properly, which causes the tissues they support to weaken. Blood vessels throughout the body become fragile, leading to the signs and symptoms of COL4A1-related brain small-vessel disease.It is unclear how mutations in the COL4A1 gene can lead to different disorders. It is likely that mutations in different regions of this gene play a role in the development of the various signs and symptoms of the COL4A1-related disorders. Other genetic changes as well as environmental factors may also contribute to the features of the different COL4A1-related disorders. "
COL4A3 ,collagen type IV alpha 3 chain,"The COL4A3 gene provides instructions for making one component of type IV collagen, which is a flexible protein. Specifically, this gene makes the alpha3(IV) chain of type IV collagen. This chain combines with two other types of alpha (IV) chains (the alpha4 and alpha5 chains) to make a complete type IV collagen molecule. Type IV collagen molecules attach to each other to form complex protein networks. These networks make up a large portion of basement membranes, which are thin sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues. Type IV collagen alpha3-4-5 networks play an especially important role in the basement membranes of the kidney, inner ear, and eye.","Alport syndrome More than 40 mutations in the COL4A3 gene have been found to cause Alport syndrome. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in a region where the alpha3(IV) collagen chain combines with other type IV collagen chains. Other mutations in the COL4A3 gene severely decrease or prevent the production of alpha3(IV) chains. As a result, there is a serious deficiency of the type IV collagen alpha3-4-5 network in the basement membranes of the kidney, inner ear, and eye. In the kidney, other types of collagen accumulate in the basement membranes, eventually leading to scarring of the kidneys and kidney failure. Mutations in this gene can also lead to abnormal function in the inner ear, resulting in hearing loss. "
COL4A4 ,collagen type IV alpha 4 chain,"The COL4A4 gene provides instructions for making one component of type IV collagen, which is a flexible protein. Specifically, this gene makes the alpha4(IV) chain of type IV collagen. This chain combines with two other types of alpha (IV) chains (the alpha3 and alpha5 chains) to make a complete type IV collagen molecule. Type IV collagen molecules attach to each other to form complex protein networks. These networks make up a large portion of basement membranes, which are thin sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues. Type IV collagen alpha3-4-5 networks play an especially important role in the basement membranes of the kidney, inner ear, and eye.","Alport syndrome More than 20 mutations in the COL4A4 gene have been found to cause Alport syndrome. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in a region where the alpha4(IV) collagen chain combines with other type IV collagen chains. Other mutations in the COL4A4 gene severely decrease or prevent the production of alpha4(IV) chains. As a result, there is a serious deficiency of the type IV collagen alpha3-4-5 network in the basement membranes of the kidney, inner ear, and eye. In the kidney, other types of collagen accumulate in the basement membranes, eventually leading to scarring of the kidneys and kidney failure. Mutations in this gene can also lead to abnormal function in the inner ear, resulting in hearing loss. "
COL4A5 ,collagen type IV alpha 5 chain,"The COL4A5 gene provides instructions for making one component of type IV collagen, which is a flexible protein. Specifically, this gene makes the alpha5(IV) chain of type IV collagen. This chain combines with two other types of alpha (IV) chains (the alpha3 and alpha4 chains) to make a complete type IV collagen molecule. Type IV collagen molecules attach to each other to form complex protein networks. These networks make up a large portion of basement membranes, which are thin sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues. Type IV collagen alpha3-4-5 networks play an especially important role in the basement membranes of the kidney, inner ear, and eye.","Alport syndrome More than 400 mutations in the COL4A5 gene have been found to cause Alport syndrome. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in a region where the alpha5(IV) collagen chain combines with other type IV collagen chains. Other mutations in the COL4A5 gene severely decrease or prevent the production of alpha5(IV) chains. As a result, there is a serious deficiency of the type IV collagen alpha3-4-5 network in the basement membranes of the kidney, inner ear, and eye. In the kidney, other types of collagen accumulate in the basement membranes, eventually leading to scarring of the kidneys and kidney failure. Mutations in this gene can also lead to abnormal function in the inner ear, resulting in hearing loss. "
COL5A1 ,collagen type V alpha 1 chain,"The COL5A1 gene provides instructions for making a component of type V collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support many tissues in the body, including skin, ligaments, bones, tendons, and muscles.A component of type V collagen called the pro-α1(V) chain is produced from the COL5A1 gene. Collagens begin as rope-like procollagen molecules that are each made up of three chains. Two combinations of chains can produce type V collagen: three pro-α1(V) chains or two pro-α1(V) chains and one pro-α2(V) chain (which is produced from the COL5A2 gene).The triple-stranded procollagen molecules are processed by enzymes outside the cell to create mature collagen. The collagen molecules then arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils with another form of collagen, type I. Type V collagen regulates the width (diameter) of those fibrils. Studies suggest that type V collagen also controls the assembly of other types of collagen into fibrils in several tissues.","Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Mutations in the COL5A1 gene cause a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome called the classical type. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect the connective tissues that support the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues. This form of the disorder is characterized by skin that is soft, highly stretchy (elastic), and fragile; abnormal scarring; and an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility). More than 100 COL5A1 gene mutations have been identified in people with classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The mutations affect one copy of the gene in each cell, reducing the amount of pro-α1(V) chains that cells produce. As a result, fibrils containing type V and type I collagens in the skin and other tissues are disorganized and larger than usual. Researchers believe that the abnormal collagen weakens connective tissues throughout the body, which causes the signs and symptoms of classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. "
COL5A2 ,collagen type V alpha 2 chain,"The COL5A2 gene provides instructions for making a component of type V collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support many tissues in the body, including skin, ligaments, bones, tendons, and muscles.A component of type V collagen called the pro-α2(V) chain is produced from the COL5A2 gene.

Studies suggest that type V collagen also controls the assembly of other types of collagen into fibrils in several tissues.","Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Mutations in the COL5A2 gene have been identified in a small number of people with a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome called the classical type. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect the connective tissues that support the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues. This form of the disorder is characterized by skin that is soft, highly stretchy (elastic), and fragile; abnormal scarring; and an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility). About 20 COL5A2 gene mutations have been identified in people with classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. These mutations, which affect one copy of the gene in each cell, change the structure of the pro-α2(V) chain. As a result, fibrils containing type V and type I collagens are disorganized and larger than usual. Researchers believe that the abnormal collagen weakens connective tissues throughout the body, which causes the signs and symptoms of classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. "
COL6A1 ,collagen type VI alpha 1 chain,"The COL6A1 gene provides instructions for making one component of type VI collagen, which is a flexible protein found in the space that surrounds cells. Specifically, the protein produced from the COL6A1 gene is the alpha(α)1(VI) chain of type VI collagen. This chain combines with chains produced from other genes to produce a complete type VI collagen molecule.Collagens are found in the extracellular matrix, which is an intricate lattice that forms in the space between cells and provides structural support. Type VI collagen is located in the extracellular matrix surrounding cells that make up the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscle cells) and cells that make up connective tissue, which provides strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body, including skin and joints. The extracellular matrix is necessary for cell stability and growth. Research suggests that type VI collagen links basement membranes, which are thin, sheet-like structures that are part of the extracellular matrix, to nearby cells.","Collagen VI-related myopathy Mutations in the COL6A1 gene have been found to cause some cases of collagen VI-related myopathy, which is a group of disorders that vary in severity but generally result in muscle weakness and joint deformities called contractures. These mutations often change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the α1(VI) chain. The most frequently affected amino acid is glycine; changes to this building block disrupt the structure of the α1(VI) chain. Other mutations can also disrupt the structure of the α1(VI) chain.Mutations in the COL6A1 gene affect type VI collagen in different ways. Some mutations lead to altered α1(VI) chains that can be incorporated into the mature type VI collagen molecule, although they disrupt the molecule's structure and function. Other mutations result in an altered chain that cannot be incorporated at all. Still other mutations prevent the production of any functional α1(VI) chain, which impedes formation of type VI collagen. All of these COL6A1 gene mutations lead to a reduction or absence of functional collagen VI molecules. While it is difficult to predict the severity of collagen VI-related myopathy based on the type of mutation, in general, lower amounts of type VI collagen lead to more severe signs and symptoms that begin earlier in life.Changes in α1(VI) chain structure or production lead to an unstable extracellular matrix that is no longer attached to cells through the basement membrane. As a result, the stability of muscle cells and connective tissue progressively declines, which leads to the muscle weakness, contractures, and other signs and symptoms of collagen VI-related myopathy.

COL6A2 ,collagen type VI alpha 2 chain,"The COL6A2 gene provides instructions for making one component of type VI collagen, which is a flexible protein found in the space that surrounds cells. Specifically, the protein produced from the COL6A2 gene is the alpha(α)2(VI) chain of type VI collagen. This chain combines with chains produced from other genes to produce a complete type VI collagen molecule.Collagens are found in the extracellular matrix, which is an intricate lattice that forms in the space between cells and provides structural support. Type VI collagen is located in the extracellular matrix surrounding cells that make up the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscle cells) and cells that make up connective tissue, which provides strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body, including skin and joints. The extracellular matrix is necessary for cell stability and growth. Research suggests that type VI collagen links basement membranes, which are thin, sheet-like structures that are part of the extracellular matrix, to nearby cells.","Collagen VI-related myopathy Mutations in the COL6A2 gene have been found to cause some cases of collagen VI-related myopathy, which is a group of disorders that vary in severity but generally result in muscle weakness and joint deformities called contractures. These mutations often change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the α2(VI) chain. The most frequently affected amino acid is glycine; changes to this building block disrupt the structure of the α2(VI) chain. Other mutations can also disrupt the structure of the α2(VI) chain.Mutations in the COL6A2 gene affect type VI collagen in different ways. Some mutations lead to altered α2(VI) chains that can be incorporated into the mature type VI collagen molecule, although they disrupt the molecule's structure and function. Other mutations result in an altered chain that cannot be incorporated at all. Still other mutations prevent the production of any functional α2(VI) chain, which impedes formation of type VI collagen. All of these COL6A2 gene mutations lead to a reduction or absence of functional collagen VI molecules. While it is difficult to predict the severity of collagen VI-related myopathy based on the type of mutation, in general, lower amounts of type VI collagen lead to more severe signs and symptoms that begin earlier in life.Changes in α2(VI) chain structure or production lead to an unstable extracellular matrix that is no longer attached to cells through the basement membrane. As a result, the stability of muscle cells and connective tissue progressively declines, which leads to the muscle weakness, contractures, and other signs and symptoms of collagen VI-related myopathy. "
COL6A3 ,collagen type VI alpha 3 chain,"The COL6A3 gene provides instructions for making one component of type VI collagen, which is a flexible protein found in the space that surrounds cells. Specifically, the protein produced from the COL6A3 gene is the alpha(α)3(VI) chain of type VI collagen. This chain combines with chains produced from other genes to produce a complete type VI collagen molecule.Collagens are found in the extracellular matrix, which is an intricate lattice that forms in the space between cells and provides structural support.

"
COL7A1 ,collagen type VII alpha 1 chain,"The COL7A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called pro-α1(VII) chain that is used to assemble a larger protein called type VII collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support connective tissues, such as skin, bone, tendons, and ligaments, throughout the body. In particular, type VII collagen plays an essential role in strengthening and stabilizing the skin.Three pro-α1(VII) chains twist together to form a triple-stranded, ropelike molecule known as a procollagen. Cells release (secrete) procollagen molecules, and enzymes cut extra protein segments from the ends. Then the molecules arrange themselves into long, thin bundles of mature type VII collagen.Type VII collagen is the major component of structures in the skin called anchoring fibrils. These fibrils are found in a region known as the epidermal basement membrane zone, which is a two-layer membrane located between the top layer of skin, called the epidermis, and an underlying layer called the dermis. Anchoring fibrils hold the two layers of skin together by connecting the epidermal basement membrane to the dermis.","Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa More than 700 mutations in the COL7A1 gene have been identified in people with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, a condition that causes the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily. These mutations alter the structure or disrupt the production of the pro-α1(VII) chain protein, which affects the production of type VII collagen. When type VII collagen is abnormal or missing, anchoring fibrils cannot form properly. A shortage of these fibrils impairs the connection of the epidermis to the dermis. As a result, friction or other minor trauma can cause the two skin layers to separate. This separation leads to the formation of blisters, which can result in extensive scarring as they heal.Researchers classify dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa into a few major types based on the inheritance pattern and features of the condition. The recessive types of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) result from mutations in both copies of the COL7A1 gene in each cell. The most severe, classic form of this disorder is known as recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa severe generalized (RDEB-sev gen). Most of the COL7A1 gene mutations responsible for RDEB-sev gen result in production of abnormally short pro-α1(VII) chains that cannot form type VII collagen. As a result, little type VII collagen is available to make anchoring fibrils. This lack of anchoring fibrils disrupts the connection between the epidermis and the dermis and causes the extreme skin fragility and other signs and symptoms of RDEB-sev gen.Somewhat less severe forms of RDEB, grouped as the generalized and localized types (RDEB-gen and -loc), are caused by other types of mutations. Many of these genetic changes alter the structure of the pro-α1(VII) chain protein such that it cannot form normal type VII collagen. As a result, anchoring fibrils are reduced in number, or they are altered and cannot function normally. The small amount of normal or partially functional anchoring fibrils accounts for the less severe signs and symptoms of RDEB-gen and -loc.A milder, dominant form of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DDEB) results from mutations in one copy of the COL7A1 gene in each cell. In many cases, these mutations alter a part of type VII collagen known as the triple helical domain. This region gives type VII collagen its usual triple-stranded structure. It is made up of a pattern of protein building blocks (amino acids) in which every third amino acid is a glycine. Mutations that substitute other amino acids for glycine in this region can disrupt the triple-stranded structure of type VII collagen. When the abnormally shaped collagen molecules are incorporated into anchoring fibrils, they interfere with the fibrils' normal function and prevent them from effectively connecting the epidermis and the dermis. Although they are most commonly associated with DDEB, mutations that substitute glycine amino acids in the triple helical domain can also cause RDEB. DDEB can also be caused by other types of mutations, particularly changes that affect the folding of type VII collagen.It is unclear how COL7A1 gene mutations are associated with an increased risk of a certain cancer called squamous cell carcinoma in people with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, particularly RDEB-sev gen. Some research has suggested that abnormal forms of type VII collagen that retain a procollagen fragment called the NC1 domain may increase the risk of tumor formation. Other studies, however, have not found this association. "
COL8A2 ,collagen type VIII alpha 2 chain,"The COL8A2 gene provides instructions for making a component of type VIII collagen called alpha 2(VIII) collagen. Type VIII collagen is largely found within the front surface of the eye, called the cornea. Type VIII collagen is a major component of Descemet's membrane, which is a tissue at the back of the cornea. This membrane is a thin, sheet-like structure that separates and supports corneal endothelium cells. These cells regulate the amount of fluid inside the cornea. An appropriate fluid balance in the cornea is necessary for clear vision.To construct type VIII collagen, one subunit of the alpha 2(VIII) collagen protein interacts with two subunits of another protein called alpha 1(VIII) collagen. These three proteins twist together to form a triple-stranded, rope-like molecule known as procollagen. Procollagen molecules are secreted by the cell and processed by enzymes to remove extra protein segments from the ends. Once these molecules are processed, they arrange themselves into long, thin bundles of mature type VIII collagen.","Fuchs endothelial dystrophy At least two mutations in the COL8A2 gene have been found to cause a variant of Fuchs endothelial dystrophy, an eye disorder characterized by progressively blurry vision and sensitivity to bright light. COL8A2 gene mutations are associated with the rare, early-onset variant of Fuchs endothelial dystrophy, in which vision problems typically begin in a person's twenties.The COL8A2 gene mutations that cause the early-onset variant of Fuchs endothelial dystrophy replace single protein building blocks in alpha 2(VIII) collagen. One mutation replaces the amino acid leucine with the amino acid tryptophan at position 450 (written as Leu450Trp or L450W). Another mutation replaces the amino acid glutamine with the amino acid lysine at position 455 (Gln455Lys or Q455K). These mutations impair the structure of alpha 2(VIII) collagen, probably preventing the abnormal protein from being incorporated into type VIII collagen fibers. As a result, there is a reduced amount of type VIII collagen in the cornea, specifically in Descemet's membrane. This abnormal Descemet's membrane leads to the death of the corneal endothelial cells, causing the cornea to become swollen with fluid. Corneal endothelial cells continue to die over time, which causes the vision problems in people with the early-onset variant of Fuchs endothelial dystrophy. "
COL9A1 ,collagen type IX alpha 1 chain,"The COL9A1 gene provides instructions for making part of a large molecule called type IX collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support connective tissues, such as skin, bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments. In particular, type IX collagen is an important component of cartilage, which is a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears.Type IX collagen is made up of three proteins that are produced from three distinct genes: one α1(IX) chain, which is produced from the COL9A1 gene, one α2(IX) chain, which is produced from the COL9A2 gene, and one α3(IX) chain, which is produced from the COL9A3 gene. Type IX collagen is more flexible than other types of collagen molecules and is closely associated with type II collagen. Researchers believe that the flexible nature of type IX collagen allows it to act as a bridge that connects type II collagen with other cartilage components. Studies have shown that type IX collagen also interacts with the proteins produced from the MATN3 and COMP genes.","Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia At least one mutation in the COL9A1 gene has been found to cause dominant multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, a disorder of cartilage and bone development that primarily affects the ends of the long bones in the arms and legs (epiphyses). The identified mutation, called a splice-site mutation, involves the addition of one DNA building block (nucleotide) near an area of the gene called exon 8 (written as 1-bp ins, IVS8, T, +3). This mutation disrupts the way the gene's instructions are used to make the α1(IX) chain, resulting in a deletion of several protein building blocks (amino acids). It is not known how this mutation in COL9A1 causes the signs and symptoms of dominant multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. "
COL9A2 ,collagen type IX alpha 2 chain,"The COL9A2 gene provides instructions for making part of a large molecule called type IX collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support connective tissues, such as skin, bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments.

Researchers believe that the flexible nature of type IX collagen allows it to act as a bridge that connects type II collagen with other cartilage components. Studies have shown that type IX collagen also interacts with the proteins produced from the MATN3 and COMP genes.","Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia At least five mutations in the COL9A2 gene have been shown to cause dominant multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, a disorder of cartilage and bone development that primarily affects the ends of the long bones in the arms and legs (epiphyses). All of these mutations disrupt how genetic information is spliced together to make the blueprint for producing the α2(IX) chain. These mutations, called splice-site mutations, change one DNA building block (nucleotide) near an area of the gene called exon 3. These mutations in the COL9A2 gene result in the deletion of 12 protein building blocks (amino acids) from the α2(IX) chain. It is not known how mutations in COL9A2 cause the signs and symptoms of dominant multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. "
COL9A3 ,collagen type IX alpha 3 chain,"The COL9A3 gene provides instructions for making part of a large molecule called type IX collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support connective tissues, such as skin, bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments. In particular, type IX collagen is an important component of cartilage.Type IX collagen is made up of three proteins that are produced from three distinct genes: one α1(IX) chain, which is produced from the COL9A1 gene, one α2(IX) chain, which is produced from the COL9A2 gene, and one α3(IX) chain, which is produced from the COL9A3 gene.

All of these mutations disrupt how genetic information is spliced together to make the blueprint for producing the α3(IX) chain. These mutations, called splice-site mutations, change one DNA building block (nucleotide) near an area of the gene called exon 3. These mutations in the COL9A3 gene result in the deletion of 12 protein building blocks (amino acids) from the α3(IX) chain. It is not known how mutations in COL9A3 cause the signs and symptoms of dominant multiple epiphyseal dysplasia.All identified mutations in type IX collagen delete a portion of the COL3 domain, which suggests that this region has an important function. Mutations may affect the ability of type IX collagen to fold correctly or interact with other cartilage components. "
COL11A1 ,collagen type XI alpha 1 chain,"The COL11A1 gene provides instructions for making a component of type XI collagen called the pro-alpha1(XI) chain. Collagens are molecules that provide structure and strength to the connective tissues that support the body's muscles, joints, organs, and skin. Type XI collagen is normally found in cartilage, a tough but flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears. Type XI collagen is also part of the inner ear; the vitreous, which is the clear gel that fills the eyeball; and the nucleus pulposus, which is the center portion of the discs between the bones of the spine (vertebrae).Collagens begin as rope-like procollagen molecules that are each made up of three chains. The pro-alpha1(XI) chain combines with two other collagen chains, pro-alpha2(XI) and pro-alpha1(II), to form a triple-stranded procollagen molecule. Then the ropelike procollagen is processed by enzymes to create mature collagen. Mature collagen molecules arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils that form stable interactions (cross-links) with one another in the spaces between cells (the extracellular matrix). The cross-links result in the formation of very strong type XI collagen fibers.Type XI collagen also helps maintain the spacing and width (diameter) of another type of collagen molecule, type II collagen. Type II collagen is an important component of the vitreous and cartilage. The arrangement and size of type II collagen fibrils is essential for the normal structure of these tissues.","Fibrochondrogenesis At least seven mutations in the COL11A1 gene have been identified in people with fibrochondrogenesis type 1, a disorder of bone growth characterized by severe skeletal abnormalities, hearing loss, and vision loss. Infants with fibrochondrogenesis type 1 have a very narrow chest that prevents the lungs from developing normally. Most children with this condition are stillborn or die shortly after birth from respiratory failure, although some have lived into childhood.Some cases of fibrochondrogenesis type 1 result from a combination of COL11A1 gene mutations. Specifically, one copy of the gene has a mutation that prevents the production of any functional pro-alpha1(XI) chain, and the other copy has a mutation that results in an abnormal version of the pro-alpha1(XI) chain. When the abnormal chain is incorporated into collagen molecules, it creates defective type XI collagen. The abnormal collagen weakens connective tissues, impairing the formation of bones throughout the skeleton and causing changes in the eye and inner ear that lead to vision and hearing problems.In at least two reported cases, fibrochondrogenesis type 1 has been caused by combinations of COL11A1 gene mutations that completely eliminate the production of the pro-alpha1(XI) chain. Researchers speculate that a loss of this chain changes the structure of type XI collagen molecules and disrupts its ability to form cross-links. However, the effects of these mutations are still under study. "
COL11A2 ,collagen type XI alpha 2 chain,"The COL11A2 gene provides instructions for making a component of type XI collagen called the pro-alpha2(XI) chain. Collagens are molecules that provide structure and strength to the connective tissues that support the body's muscles, joints, organs, and skin. Type XI collagen is normally found in cartilage, a tough but flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears. Type XI collagen made with the pro-alpha2(XI) chain is also part of the inner ear and the nucleus pulposus, which is the center portion of the discs between the bones of the spine (vertebrae).Collagens begin as rope-like procollagen molecules that are each made up of three chains. The pro-alpha2(XI) chain combines with two other collagen chains, pro-alpha1(XI) and pro-alpha1(II), to form a triple-stranded procollagen molecule. Then the ropelike procollagen is processed by enzymes to create mature collagen. Mature collagen molecules arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils that form stable interactions (cross-links) with one another in the spaces between cells (the extracellular matrix).

Most infants with this condition are stillborn or die shortly after birth from respiratory failure, although some have lived into childhood.The COL11A2 gene mutations that cause fibrochondrogenesis type 2 lead to the production of an abnormal version of the pro-alpha2(XI) chain. When this abnormal chain is incorporated into collagen molecules, it creates defective type XI collagen. The abnormal collagen weakens connective tissues, impairing the formation of bones throughout the skeleton and causing changes in the inner ear that lead to hearing problems. "
COL17A1 ,collagen type XVII alpha 1 chain,"The COL17A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is used to assemble type XVII collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support connective tissues, such as skin, bone, tendons, and ligaments, throughout the body. In particular, type XVII collagen plays an essential role in strengthening and stabilizing the skin.The protein produced from the COL17A1 gene is known as a pro-α1(XVII) chain. Three identical pro-α1(XVII) chains twist together to form a triple-stranded, ropelike molecule known as a procollagen. Procollagen molecules are released from the cell and processed by enzymes to remove extra protein segments from the ends. Once these molecules are processed, they arrange themselves into long, thin bundles of mature type XVII collagen.Type XVII collagen is a major component of hemidesmosomes, which are microscopic structures on the inner surface of the top layer of skin (the epidermis). These structures help to anchor the epidermis to underlying layers of skin. Type XVII collagen is critical for the stability of hemidesmosomes, and therefore it plays an important role in holding the layers of skin together.","Junctional epidermolysis bullosa More than 100 mutations in the COL17A1 gene have been identified in people with junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB). Most of these mutations add or remove several DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the COL17A1 gene or create a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the pro-α1(XVII) chain. These changes reduce the amount of functional type XVII collagen in the skin. Without enough of this collagen, the epidermis is only weakly attached to underlying layers of skin. Friction or other minor trauma (such as rubbing or scratching) can cause the skin layers to separate, leading to the formation of blisters.Most COL17A1 gene mutations cause the milder form of junctional epidermolysis bullosa, known as JEB generalized intermediate. Affected individuals experience blistering, but it may be limited to the hands, feet, knees, and elbows and often improves after the newborn period. A few individuals with mutations in the COL17A1 gene have had the more serious form of the disorder, JEB generalized severe. Infants with JEB generalized severe develop widespread blistering that causes life-threatening complications. "
COL18A1 ,collagen type XVIII alpha 1 chain,"The COL18A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms collagen XVIII. Three COL18A1 proteins, called alpha 1 subunits, attach to each other to form collagen XVIII. Collagen XVIII is found in the basement membranes of tissues throughout the body. Basement membranes are thin, sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in these tissues.There are three versions (isoforms) of the alpha 1 subunit of collagen XVIII, which form three different lengths of the collagen XVIII protein. The short version of collagen XVIII is found in basement membranes throughout the body, including several parts of the eye. The two longer versions are found primarily in the liver. In addition, a piece of collagen XVIII can be cut off to form the protein endostatin. Endostatin is able to block the formation of blood vessels (angiogenesis) and is known as an anti-angiogenic factor.Little is known about the function of collagen XVIII, but it appears that all of the isoforms are involved in normal development of the eye.","Knobloch syndrome At least a dozen mutations in the COL18A1 gene have been identified in people with Knobloch syndrome, a condition characterized by severe vision problems and a skull defect called an occipital encephalocele. Most COL18A1 gene mutations lead to an abnormally short version of the genetic blueprint used to make the alpha 1 subunit of collagen XVIII. There are a few other mutations that replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the protein sequence. Although the process is unclear, the COL18A1 gene mutations result in the loss of collagen XVIII. Most COL18A1 gene mutations affect all isoforms of collagen XVIII, but at least one mutation affects only the short isoform. The loss of one or all isoforms of the collagen XVIII protein likely causes the signs and symptoms of Knobloch syndrome. It is unclear whether endostatin is involved in this condition. "
COLEC10 ,collectin subfamily member 10,"The COLEC10 gene provides instructions for making a protein called collectin liver 1 (CL-L1). This protein is involved in a series of steps called the lectin complement pathway, which is thought to help direct the movement (migration) of cells during development before birth to form the organs and systems of the body. The lectin complement pathway appears to be particularly important in directing the migration of neural crest cells. These cells give rise to various tissues including many tissues in the face and skull, glands that produce hormones (endocrine glands), and portions of the nervous system. After birth, the lectin complement pathway is involved in the immune system.","3MC syndrome At least three COLEC10 gene mutations have been identified in people with 3MC syndrome, a disorder characterized by unusual facial features and a variety of problems affecting other tissues and organs. The COLEC10 gene mutations that cause 3MC syndrome impair or eliminate the function of the CL-L1 protein, resulting in faulty control of cell migration in early development and leading to the various abnormalities that occur in this disorder. Researchers suggest that similar pathways in the immune system can compensate for problems in the lectin complement pathway, which explains why immune system abnormalities are not part of 3MC syndrome. "
COLEC11 ,collectin subfamily member 11,"The COLEC11 gene provides instructions for making a protein called collectin kidney 1 (CL-K1). This protein is involved in a series of steps called the lectin complement pathway, which is thought to help direct the movement (migration) of cells during development before birth to form the organs and systems of the body. The lectin complement pathway appears to be particularly important in directing the migration of neural crest cells. These cells give rise to various tissues including many tissues in the face and skull, glands that produce hormones (endocrine glands), and portions of the nervous system. After birth, the lectin complement pathway is involved in the immune system.","3MC syndrome At least nine COLEC11 gene mutations have been identified in people with 3MC syndrome, a disorder characterized by unusual facial features and a variety of problems affecting other tissues and organs. The COLEC11 gene mutations that cause 3MC syndrome impair or eliminate the function of the CL-K1 protein, resulting in faulty control of cell migration in early development and leading to the various abnormalities that occur in this disorder. Researchers suggest that similar pathways in the immune system can compensate for problems in the lectin complement pathway, which explains why immune system abnormalities are not part of 3MC syndrome. "
COLQ ,collagen like tail subunit of asymmetric acetylcholinesterase,The COLQ gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in the neuromuscular junction. The neuromuscular junction is the area between the ends of nerve cells and muscle cells where signals are relayed to trigger muscle movement.The ColQ protein anchors another protein called acetylcholinesterase to the muscle cell membrane at the neuromuscular junction. The ColQ protein is made up of three identical parts (subunits). Each subunit attaches (binds) to a bundle of four acetylcholinesterase proteins. Acetylcholinesterase plays a role in regulating the length of signaling between nerve cells and muscle cells by breaking down the signaling protein acetylcholine.,"Congenital myasthenic syndrome More than 35 mutations in the COLQ gene have been found to cause congenital myasthenic syndrome. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ColQ protein or lead to the production of a shortened, nonfunctional protein. A lack of functional ColQ protein leads to a reduction in the amount of acetylcholinesterase that is available in the neuromuscular junction. As a result, acetylcholine is not broken down so signaling between nerve and muscle cells is prolonged. This signaling overload can damage muscle cells, leading to the muscle weakness characteristic of congenital myasthenic syndrome. "
COMP ,cartilage oligomeric matrix protein,"The COMP gene provides the instructions for making the COMP protein. This protein is found in the extracellular matrix, which is an intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. Specifically, the COMP protein is located in the extracellular matrix surrounding the cells that make up ligaments and tendons, and near cartilage-forming cells (chondrocytes). Chondrocytes play an important role in bone formation (osteogenesis). In the bones of the spine, hips, and limbs, the process of osteogenesis starts with the formation of cartilage, which is then converted into bone.The normal function of the COMP protein is not fully known. It is believed to play a role in cell growth and division (proliferation) and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis), as well as in the regulation of cell movement and attachment. Research has also shown that the COMP protein binds strongly to calcium.","Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia More than 20 mutations in the COMP gene that cause dominant multiple epiphyseal dysplasia have been identified. This disorder can also be caused by mutations in four other genes; however, the majority of individuals have mutations in the COMP gene.Mutations in the COMP gene that cause dominant multiple epiphyseal dysplasia change one protein building block (amino acid) or result in small additions or deletions of amino acids in the COMP protein. All identified mutations have occurred in two regions of the COMP protein, which are referred to as the type III and C-terminal domains. COMP mutations lead to the improper folding of the COMP protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, a structure in the cell involved in protein processing and transport. The abnormal COMP protein is unable to leave the endoplasmic reticulum, which causes this cellular structure to enlarge. The endoplasmic reticulum eventually becomes so large that it is no longer able to function normally, and the chondrocyte dies. The premature death of chondrocytes results in diminished growth of the long bones and short stature.Researchers believe that the lack of COMP protein in the spaces between the chondrocytes leads to the formation of abnormal cartilage. This abnormal cartilage probably breaks down easily, which results in early-onset osteoarthritis. "
COMT ,catechol-O-methyltransferase,"The COMT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called catechol-O-methyltransferase. Two versions of this enzyme are made from the gene. The longer form, called membrane-bound catechol-O-methyltransferase (MB-COMT), is chiefly produced by nerve cells in the brain. Other tissues, including the liver, kidneys, and blood, produce a shorter form of the enzyme called soluble catechol-O-methyltransferase (S-COMT). This form of the enzyme helps control the levels of certain hormones.In the brain, catechol-O-methyltransferase helps break down certain chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. These chemicals conduct signals from one nerve cell to another. Catechol-O-methyltransferase is particularly important in an area at the front of the brain called the prefrontal cortex, which organizes and coordinates information from other parts of the brain. This region is involved with personality, planning, inhibition of behaviors, abstract thinking, emotion, and working (short-term) memory. To function efficiently, the prefrontal cortex requires signaling by neurotransmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine. Catechol-O-methyltransferase helps maintain appropriate levels of these neurotransmitters in this part of the brain.","22q11.2 deletion syndrome The characteristic signs and symptoms of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome result from a deletion of a small piece of chromosome 22. The chromosomal region that is typically deleted contains 30 to 40 genes, including the COMT gene. As a result of the deletion, people with this disorder have only one copy of the COMT gene in each cell instead of the usual two copies.A loss of one copy of the COMT gene in each cell leads to abnormal regulation of catechol-O-methyltransferase levels in the brain. Researchers believe that changes involving this enzyme in the prefrontal cortex may help explain the increased risk of behavioral problems and mental illness associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Little is known, however, about the relationship between catechol-O-methyltransferase activity and the specific mental and emotional problems characteristic of this condition. People with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are much more likely than people without the condition to develop schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. "
COQ2 ,"coenzyme Q2, polyprenyltransferase","The COQ2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that carries out one step in the production of a molecule called coenzyme Q10, which has several critical functions in cells throughout the body. In cell structures called mitochondria, coenzyme Q10 plays an essential role in a process called oxidative phosphorylation, which converts the energy from food into a form cells can use. Coenzyme Q10 is also involved in producing pyrimidines, which are building blocks of DNA, its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as ATP and GTP that serve as energy sources in the cell. In cell membranes, coenzyme Q10 acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by unstable oxygen-containing molecules (free radicals), which are byproducts of energy production.","Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency At least nine mutations in the COQ2 gene have been found to cause a disorder known as primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. This rare disease usually becomes apparent in infancy or early childhood, but it can occur at any age. It can affect many parts of the body, most often the brain, muscles, and kidneys. The COQ2 gene mutations associated with this disorder greatly reduce or eliminate the production of the COQ2 enzyme, which prevents the normal production of coenzyme Q10. Studies suggest that a shortage (deficiency) of coenzyme Q10 impairs oxidative phosphorylation and increases the vulnerability of cells to damage from free radicals. A deficiency of coenzyme Q10 may also disrupt the production of pyrimidines. These changes can cause cells throughout the body to malfunction, which may help explain the variety of organs and tissues that can be affected by primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. "
COQ4 ,coenzyme Q4,"The COQ4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the production of a molecule called coenzyme Q10, although its specific role in this process is unknown. Research suggests that the COQ4 protein may help organize other proteins involved in coenzyme Q10 production into a stable functional group (a protein complex).Coenzyme Q10 has several critical functions in cells throughout the body. In cell structures called mitochondria, coenzyme Q10 plays an essential role in a process called oxidative phosphorylation, which converts the energy from food into a form cells can use. Coenzyme Q10 is also involved in producing pyrimidines, which are building blocks of DNA, its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as ATP and GTP that serve as energy sources in the cell. In cell membranes, coenzyme Q10 acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by unstable oxygen-containing molecules (free radicals), which are byproducts of energy production.","Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency At least 12 mutations in the COQ4 gene have been found to cause a disorder known as primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. This rare disease usually becomes apparent in infancy or early childhood, but it can occur at any age. It can affect many parts of the body, most often the brain, muscles, and kidneys. The COQ4 gene mutations associated with this disorder greatly reduce or eliminate the production of the COQ4 protein, which prevents the normal production of coenzyme Q10.

A deficiency of coenzyme Q10 may also disrupt the production of pyrimidines. These changes can cause cells throughout the body to malfunction, which may help explain the variety of organs and tissues that can be affected by primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. "
COQ6 ,"coenzyme Q6, monooxygenase","The COQ6 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that carries out one step in the production of a molecule called coenzyme Q10. Coenzyme Q10 has several critical functions in cells throughout the body. In cell structures called mitochondria, coenzyme Q10 plays an essential role in a process called oxidative phosphorylation, which converts the energy from food into a form cells can use.

In cell membranes, coenzyme Q10 acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by unstable oxygen-containing molecules (free radicals), which are byproducts of energy production.","Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency At least seven mutations in the COQ6 gene have been found to cause a disorder known as primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. This rare disease usually becomes apparent in infancy or early childhood, but it can occur at any age. It can affect many parts of the body, most often the brain, muscles, and kidneys. The COQ6 gene mutations associated with this disorder result in a COQ6 enzyme with an abnormal structure that likely impairs its function, leading to reduced production of coenzyme Q10. Studies suggest that a shortage (deficiency) of coenzyme Q10 impairs oxidative phosphorylation and increases the vulnerability of cells to damage from free radicals. A deficiency of coenzyme Q10 may also disrupt the production of pyrimidines. These changes can cause cells throughout the body to malfunction, which may help explain the variety of organs and tissues that can be affected by primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. "
COQ8A ,coenzyme Q8A,"The COQ8A gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the production of a molecule called coenzyme Q10, which has several critical functions in cells throughout the body. In cell structures called mitochondria, coenzyme Q10 plays an essential role in a process called oxidative phosphorylation, which converts the energy from food into a form cells can use.

In cell membranes, coenzyme Q10 acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by unstable oxygen-containing molecules (free radicals), which are byproducts of energy production.","Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency At least 36 mutations in the COQ8A gene have been found to cause a disorder known as primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. This rare disease usually becomes apparent in infancy or early childhood, but it can occur at any age. It can affect many parts of the body, most often the brain, muscles, and kidneys. The COQ8A gene mutations associated with this disorder change the structure of the COQ8A protein or prevent its production, which impairs the normal production of coenzyme Q10. Studies suggest that a shortage (deficiency) of coenzyme Q10 impairs oxidative phosphorylation and increases the vulnerability of cells to damage from free radicals. A deficiency of coenzyme Q10 may also disrupt the production of pyrimidines. These changes can cause cells throughout the body to malfunction, which may help explain the variety of organs and tissues that can be affected by primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. "
COQ8B ,coenzyme Q8B,"The COQ8B gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the production of a molecule called coenzyme Q10, which has several critical functions in cells throughout the body. In cell structures called mitochondria, coenzyme Q10 plays an essential role in a process called oxidative phosphorylation, which converts the energy from food into a form cells can use.

In cell membranes, coenzyme Q10 acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by unstable oxygen-containing molecules (free radicals), which are byproducts of energy production.","Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency At least 11 mutations in the COQ8B gene have been found to cause a disorder known as primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. This rare disease usually becomes apparent in infancy or early childhood, but it can occur at any age. It can affect many parts of the body, most often the brain, muscles, and kidneys. The COQ8B gene mutations associated with this disorder greatly reduce or eliminate the function of the COQ8B protein, which prevents the normal production of coenzyme Q10. Studies suggest that a shortage (deficiency) of coenzyme Q10 impairs oxidative phosphorylation and increases the vulnerability of cells to damage from free radicals. A deficiency of coenzyme Q10 may also disrupt the production of pyrimidines. These changes can cause cells throughout the body to malfunction, which may help explain the variety of organs and tissues that can be affected by primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. "
CP ,ceruloplasmin,"The CP gene provides instructions for making a protein called ceruloplasmin. Ceruloplasmin helps move iron from the organs and tissues of the body into the blood. This protein prepares iron for incorporation into a molecule called transferrin, which transports the iron to red blood cells.There are two forms of ceruloplasmin. One form, serum ceruloplasmin, is made primarily in the liver. It is involved in transporting iron from most of the body, but is unable to enter the brain. The other form of ceruloplasmin, called the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored form, is important for processing iron in the brain and releasing it from brain tissue. This form of ceruloplasmin is made in nervous system cells called glia, which protect and maintain nerve cells (neurons).","Aceruloplasminemia Approximately 40 mutations in the CP gene that cause aceruloplasminemia have been identified. Some of these mutations substitute one protein building block (amino acid) for another amino acid in the ceruloplasmin protein, resulting in an unstable protein that quickly breaks down (degrades). Other mutations result in the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the protein or prevent the protein from being secreted by the cells in which it is made. Absence of functional ceruloplasmin results in iron transport problems that lead to the iron accumulation, neurological dysfunction, and other health problems seen in aceruloplasminemia. "
CPOX ,coproporphyrinogen oxidase,"The CPOX gene provides instructions for making an enzyme known as coproporphyrinogen oxidase. This enzyme is involved in the production of a molecule called heme. Heme is vital for all of the body's organs, although it is most abundant in the blood, bone marrow, and liver. Heme is an essential component of iron-containing proteins called hemoproteins, including hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in the blood).The production of heme is a multi-step process that requires eight different enzymes. Coproporphyrinogen oxidase is responsible for the sixth step in this process, the removal of carbon and oxygen atoms from coproporphyrinogen III (the product of the fifth step) to form protoporphyrinogen IX. In subsequent steps, two other enzymes modify protoporphyrinogen IX and incorporate an iron atom to produce heme.","Porphyria At least 45 mutations in the CPOX gene have been found to cause porphyria. Mutations in this gene can cause two types of porphyria: hereditary coproporphyria and a variant known as harderoporphyria.Most CPOX gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in coproporphyrinogen oxidase. A single mutation appears to be responsible for harderoporphyria; this genetic change replaces the amino acid glycine with the amino acid glutamic acid at position 404 (written as Lys404Glu or K404E). Mutations in the CPOX gene reduce the activity of coproporphyrinogen oxidase, allowing compounds called porphyrins to build up in the body. These compounds are formed during the normal process of heme production, but reduced activity of coproporphyrinogen oxidase allows them to accumulate to toxic levels. This buildup, in combination with nongenetic factors such as certain drugs, alcohol, and dieting, leads to the signs and symptoms of hereditary coproporphyria and harderoporphyria. "
CPS1 ,carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1,"The CPS1 gene provides instructions for making the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I. This enzyme participates in the urea cycle, a series of reactions that occurs in liver cells. The urea cycle processes excess nitrogen, generated when protein is used by the body, into a compound called urea that is excreted by the kidneys. Excreting the excess nitrogen prevents it from accumulating in the form of ammonia, which is toxic.The specific role of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I is to control the first step of the urea cycle, a reaction in which excess nitrogen compounds are incorporated into the cycle to be processed.","Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency Approximately 10 mutations that cause carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency have been identified in the CPS1 gene. A mutated CPS1 gene may result in a carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I enzyme that is shorter than normal or the wrong shape, or may prevent the enzyme from being produced at all.The shape of an enzyme affects its ability to control a chemical reaction. If the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase enzyme is misshapen or missing, it cannot fulfill its role in the urea cycle. Excess nitrogen is not converted to urea for excretion, and ammonia accumulates in the body. Ammonia is toxic, especially to the nervous system, so this accumulation causes neurological problems and other signs and symptoms of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency. "
CPT1A ,carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A,"The CPT1A gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, which is found in the liver. This enzyme is essential for fatty acid oxidation, a multistep process that breaks down (metabolizes) fats and converts them into energy. Fatty acid oxidation takes place within mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers in cells. A group of fats called long-chain fatty acids cannot enter mitochondria unless they are attached to a substance known as carnitine. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A connects carnitine to long-chain fatty acids so they can cross the inner membrane of mitochondria. Once these fatty acids are inside mitochondria, carnitine is removed and they can be metabolized to produce energy. During periods of fasting, long-chain fatty acids are an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.","Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency More than 20 mutations in the CPT1A gene have been found to cause carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) deficiency. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) within carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A. Mutations in the CPT1A gene severely reduce or eliminate the activity of this enzyme. Without enough of this enzyme, carnitine is not attached to long-chain fatty acids. As a result, these fatty acids cannot enter mitochondria and be converted into energy. Reduced energy production can lead to some of the features of CPT I deficiency, such as low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and low levels of the products of fat breakdown (hypoketosis). Fatty acids may also build up in cells and damage the liver, heart, and brain. This abnormal buildup causes the other signs and symptoms of the disorder. "
CPT2 ,carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2,"The CPT2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2. This enzyme is essential for fatty acid oxidation, a multistep process that breaks down (metabolizes) fats and converts them into energy. Fatty acid oxidation takes place within mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers in cells. A group of fats called long-chain fatty acids must be attached to a substance known as carnitine to enter mitochondria. Once these fatty acids are inside mitochondria, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 removes the carnitine and adds a substance called coenzyme A. Long-chain fatty acids must be joined to coenzyme A before they can be metabolized to produce energy. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods of fasting, fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.","Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency More than 70 mutations in the CPT2 gene have been found to cause carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) deficiency. These mutations lead to reduced activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2. Mutations that lead to extremely reduced enzyme activity typically cause the more severe forms of CPT II deficiency (a lethal neonatal form and a severe infantile hepatocardiomuscular form), while those that result in partially reduced enzyme activity usually lead to a less severe myopathic form of the disorder. The most common CPT2 gene mutation replaces the protein building block (amino acid) serine with the amino acid leucine at position 113 (written as Ser113Leu or S113L) in the enzyme. This mutation accounts for about 60 percent of the mutations that cause the myopathic form of CPT II deficiency.Without enough functioning carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2, long-chain fatty acids are not properly processed after they enter mitochondria and cannot be metabolized to produce energy. Reduced energy production can lead to some of the features of CPT II deficiency, such as muscle pain and weakness, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), and low levels of the products of fat breakdown (hypoketosis). Fatty acids and long-chain acylcarnitines (fatty acids still attached to carnitine) may also build up in cells and damage the liver, heart, and muscles. This abnormal buildup causes the other signs and symptoms of the disorder. "
CRB1 ,"crumbs 1, cell polarity complex component","The CRB1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an essential role in normal vision. This protein is found in the brain and the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color.In the retina, the CRB1 protein appears to be critical for the normal development of light-sensing cells called photoreceptors. Studies suggest that this protein is part of a group (complex) of proteins that help determine the structure and orientation of photoreceptors. The CRB1 protein may also be involved in forming connections between different types of cells in the retina.","Leber congenital amaurosis More than 50 mutations in the CRB1 gene have been found to cause Leber congenital amaurosis. Mutations in this gene account for 9 to 13 percent of all cases of this condition.Most of the CRB1 gene mutations responsible for Leber congenital amaurosis lead to an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the CRB1 protein or significantly reduce the amount of this protein produced in cells. A shortage of the CRB1 protein disrupts the early development of the retina. The retina becomes unusually thick and does not develop the normal layered structure. These changes cause severe visual impairment beginning very early in life. "
CREBBP ,CREB binding protein,"The CREBBP gene provides instructions for making CREB binding protein, which regulates the activity of many genes in tissues throughout the body. This protein plays an essential role in controlling cell growth and division and prompting cells to mature and assume specialized functions (differentiate). CREB binding protein appears to be critical for normal development before and after birth. Studies show that this protein is involved in development of the brain and may also be involved in the formation of long-term memories.CREB binding protein carries out its functions by turning on (activating) transcription, which is the first step in the production of proteins from the instructions stored in DNA. The CREB binding protein ensures the DNA is ready for transcription by attaching a small molecule called an acetyl group to proteins called histones (a process called acetylation). Histones are structural proteins that bind DNA and give chromosomes their shape. Acetylation of the histone changes the shape of the chromosome, making genes available for transcription. On the basis of this function, CREB binding protein is called a histone acetyltransferase.In addition, CREB binding protein connects other proteins that start the transcription process (known as transcription factors) with the group of proteins that carries out transcription. On the basis of this function, CREB binding protein is called a transcriptional coactivator.","Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome Mutations in the CREBBP gene have been found to cause Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, a condition characterized by short stature, moderate to severe intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and broad thumbs and first toes. More than 300 mutations have been identified, including the loss (deletion) or addition (insertion) of genetic material in the gene and changes in single DNA building blocks (nucleotides).Because one copy of the CREBBP gene is altered in people with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, their cells make only half of the normal amount of functional CREB binding protein. Although researchers are uncertain how a reduction in the amount of this protein leads to the features of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, it is clear that variations in the CREBBP gene disrupt normal development before and after birth. Problems with development of the brain are thought to underlie intellectual disability in people with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Other features of the condition likely result from abnormal development of other systems.Deletion of genetic material from the short (p) arm of chromosome 16 can cause severe Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, which features an inability to grow or gain weight in infancy, serious infections, and abnormalities of certain organs, such as the heart or spleen, in addition to the classic symptoms of the condition. Multiple genes, including the CREBBP gene, are missing as a result of the deletion. Researchers believe that the loss of multiple genes in this region probably accounts for the serious complications associated with severe Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Some researchers suggest that these cases are a separate condition called chromosome 16p13.3 deletion syndrome. However, a few studies indicate that large deletions in the p arm of chromosome 16 do not always cause severe signs and symptoms, so it is unclear if the disorders are separate. "
CRLF1 ,cytokine receptor like factor 1,"The CRLF1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cytokine receptor-like factor 1 (CRLF1). This protein partners with a similar protein called cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1), which is produced from the CLCF1 gene. Together, these two proteins form a unit known as the CRLF1/CLCF1 protein complex. This complex attaches (binds) to a receptor protein known as the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) on the surface of many types of cells. When the CRLF1/CLCF1 protein complex is bound to CNTFR, it triggers signaling inside the cell that affects cell development and function.The CNTFR signaling pathway is primarily involved in the development and maintenance of the nervous system. It promotes the survival of nerve cells (neurons), particularly nerve cells that control muscle movement (motor neurons). The CNTFR pathway also plays a role in a part of the nervous system called the sympathetic nervous system, specifically in the regulation of sweating in response to temperature changes and other factors. This signaling pathway appears to be critical for the normal development and maturation of nerve cells that control the activity of sweat glands.Studies suggest that the CNTFR signaling pathway also has functions outside the nervous system. It may be involved in the body's inflammatory response, which helps fight infection and facilitate tissue repair following an injury. This pathway may also be important for the development and maintenance of bone tissue. However, little is known about the role of CNTFR signaling in these processes.","Cold-induced sweating syndrome At least 10 mutations in the CRLF1 gene have been reported to cause cold-induced sweating syndrome, a rare condition characterized by problems with regulating body temperature and other abnormalities affecting many parts of the body. When this condition is caused by CRLF1 gene mutations, it is known as CISS1.Mutations in the CRLF1 gene lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of the CRLF1 protein or greatly reduce the production of functional CRLF1 protein. Consequently, CRLF1 is unavailable to interact with the CLCF1 protein and bind to CNTFR, which disables the CNTFR signaling pathway.Researchers believe that a failure of CNTFR signaling underlies the major features of cold-induced sweating syndrome. A loss of this signaling pathway during sympathetic nervous system development may help explain the abnormal sweating that is characteristic of this condition, including unusual sweating patterns and related problems with body temperature regulation. The CNTFR pathway's involvement in motor neuron development and bone development provides clues to some of the other signs and symptoms of the disorder, including distinctive facial features, facial muscle weakness, and skeletal abnormalities. However, little is known about how a lack of CNTFR signaling leads to these varied features. "
CRPPA ,CDP-L-ribitol pyrophosphorylase A,"The CRPPA gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in a process called glycosylation. Through this chemical process, sugar molecules are added to certain proteins. In particular, the CRPPA protein helps produce a molecule called ribitol 5-phosphate, which is an important component of the chain of sugar molecules added to a protein called alpha (α)-dystroglycan. Glycosylation is critical for the normal function of α-dystroglycan.The α-dystroglycan protein helps anchor the structural framework inside each cell (cytoskeleton) to the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell (extracellular matrix). In skeletal muscles, glycosylated α-dystroglycan helps stabilize and protect muscle fibers. In the brain, it helps direct the movement (migration) of nerve cells (neurons) during early development.","Walker-Warburg syndrome At least 17 mutations in the CRPPA gene have been found to cause Walker-Warburg syndrome, the most severe form of a group of disorders known as congenital muscular dystrophies. Walker-Warburg syndrome causes skeletal muscle weakness and abnormalities of the brain and eyes. Because of the severity of the problems caused by this condition, affected individuals usually do not survive past early childhood.CRPPA gene mutations involved in Walker-Warburg syndrome prevent the normal glycosylation of α-dystroglycan. As a result, α-dystroglycan can no longer effectively anchor cells to the proteins and other molecules that surround them. Without functional α-dystroglycan to stabilize the muscle fibers, they become damaged as they repeatedly contract and relax with use. The damaged fibers weaken and die over time, which affects the development, structure, and function of skeletal muscles in people with Walker-Warburg syndrome.Defective α-dystroglycan also affects the migration of neurons during the early development of the brain. Instead of stopping when they reach their intended destinations, some neurons migrate past the surface of the brain into the fluid-filled space that surrounds it. Researchers believe that this problem with neuronal migration causes a brain abnormality called cobblestone lissencephaly, in which the surface of the brain lacks the normal folds and grooves and instead appears bumpy and irregular. Less is known about the effects of CRPPA gene mutations on other parts of the body. "
CRX ,cone-rod homeobox,"The CRX gene provides instructions for making a protein called the cone-rod homeobox protein. This protein is found in the eyes, specifically in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye called the retina. The cone-rod homeobox protein attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. On the basis of this action, this protein is called a transcription factor.In the retina, the cone-rod homeobox protein is necessary for the normal development of light-detecting cells called photoreceptors. Through its actions as a transcription factor, the cone-rod homeobox protein helps photoreceptor cells mature into two types: rods and cones. Rods are needed for vision in low light, while cones are needed for vision in bright light, including color vision. The protein also helps maintain these cells and preserve vision.","Cone-rod dystrophy More than 20 mutations in the CRX gene have been found to cause cone-rod dystrophy. The problems associated with this condition include a loss of visual sharpness (acuity), an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), and impaired color vision. These vision problems worsen over time. Cone-rod dystrophy is caused by mutations that occur in one of the two copies of the CRX gene in each cell. CRX gene mutations are responsible for about one-quarter of the cases of a form of the condition called autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy. These mutations lead to a reduction in the amount of functional cone-rod homeobox protein that is available to regulate other genes in the retina. As a result, maintenance of the rod and cone cells is insufficient and these cells deteriorate over time, leading to the vision problems characteristic of cone-rod dystrophy. Researchers believe that there is enough cone-rod homeobox protein function to allow for photoreceptor cell differentiation, but long-term maintenance of the cells cannot be sustained.Several CRX gene mutations have been found to cause different forms of vision loss in different individuals. It is unclear how mutations in the CRX gene can cause different eye disorders. "
CSF1R ,colony stimulating factor 1 receptor,"The CSF1R gene provides instructions for making a protein called the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1 receptor). This protein is found in the outer membrane of certain cell types. When a specific protein called colony stimulating factor 1 attaches (binds) to it, the receptor turns on (activates) a series of proteins inside the cell that are part of multiple signaling pathways. The signaling pathways stimulated by the CSF-1 receptor control many important cellular processes such as cell growth and division (proliferation) and maturation of cells to take on specific functions (differentiation).In the brain, the CSF-1 receptor is abundant in the membrane of specialized cells called glial cells. These cells protect and maintain nerve cells (neurons). The CSF-1 receptor is thought to be involved in the proliferation and differentiation of glial cells, but its exact role in the brain is unclear.","Adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia More than a dozen mutations in the CSF1R gene have been found in people with adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP). ALSP is a severe neurological disorder characterized by damage to a type of brain tissue called white matter. Symptoms of this condition typically begin in adulthood and progress to severe cognitive and movement problems. Most CSF1R gene mutations in ALSP change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the CSF-1 receptor. Other mutations change the sequence of amino acids in other ways. The mutations all occur in the region of the receptor that activates other proteins (called the kinase domain). It is likely that the altered receptor is unable to stimulate cell signaling pathways. However, it is unclear how the gene mutations lead to white matter damage or cognitive and movement problems in people with ALSP. "
CST3 ,cystatin C,"The CST3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cystatin C. This protein is part of a family of proteins called cysteine protease inhibitors that help control several types of chemical reactions by blocking (inhibiting) the activity of certain enzymes. Cystatin C inhibits the activity of enzymes called cathepsins that cut apart other proteins in order to break them down.Cystatin C is found in biological fluids, such as blood. Its levels are especially high in the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord (the cerebrospinal fluid or CSF).","Hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy At least one mutation in the CST3 gene has been found to cause hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a condition characterized by stroke and a decline in intellectual function (dementia), which begins in mid-adulthood. The CST3 gene mutation that has been identified causes a form of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy known as the Icelandic type. This mutation replaces the protein building block (amino acid) leucine with the amino acid glutamine at position 68 in the cystatin C protein (written as Leu68Gln or L68Q). This abnormal cystatin C protein is less stable and is more prone to cluster together (aggregate) than the normal protein. The aggregated protein forms clumps called amyloid deposits that accumulate in the blood vessel walls primarily in the brain, but also in blood vessels in other areas of the body such as the skin, spleen, and lymph nodes. The accumulation of these amyloid deposits, known as plaques, does not appear to have any health effects outside of the brain. In the brain, the amyloid plaques replace the muscle fibers and elastic fibers that give blood vessels flexibility, causing them to become weak and prone to breakage. Such a break in the brain causes bleeding (hemorrhagic stroke), which can lead to brain damage and dementia. "
CSTB ,cystatin B,"The CSTB gene provides instructions for making a protein called cystatin B. This protein reduces the activity of (inhibits) enzymes called cathepsins. Cathepsins help break down certain proteins in the lysosomes (compartments in the cell that digest and recycle materials). While the specific function of cystatin B is unclear, it may help protect the cells' proteins from cathepsins that leak out of the lysosomes.One region of the CSTB gene has a particular repeating sequence of 12 DNA building blocks (nucleotides) written as CCCCG-CCCCG-CG. This sequence, called a dodecamer repeat, is usually repeated two or three times within a part of the gene that helps regulate cystatin B protein production.","Unverricht-Lundborg disease In almost all affected individuals, Unverricht-Lundborg disease is caused by an increased number of copies (expansion) of the dodecamer repeat in the CSTB gene. Most people with this disorder have more than 30 repeats of the dodecamer sequence in both copies of the CSTB gene.In a small number of individuals, one copy of the CSTB gene has the expanded dodecamer repeat while the second copy carries one of nine other identified mutations. Some of these mutations substitute one protein building block (amino acid) for another amino acid in the cystatin B protein. Others result in a shortened protein that may function improperly or not at all, or cause the protein to be pieced together incorrectly. Only one individual with Unverricht-Lundborg disease has been reported to have mutations other than the dodecamer repeat expansion in both copies of the gene in each cell.The expanded dodecamer repeat in the CSTB gene seems to interfere with the production of cystatin B protein. Levels of cystatin B in affected individuals are only 5 to 10 percent of normal, and cathepsin levels are significantly increased. These changes are believed to cause the signs and symptoms of Unverricht-Lundborg disease, but the specific mechanism is unknown. "
CTC1 ,CST telomere replication complex component 1,"The CTC1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in structures known as telomeres, which are found at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres are short, repetitive segments of DNA that help protect chromosomes from abnormally sticking together or breaking down (degrading). In most cells, telomeres become progressively shorter as the cell divides. After a certain number of cell divisions, the telomeres become so short that they trigger the cell to stop dividing or to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis).The CTC1 protein works as part of a group of proteins known as the CST complex, which is involved in the maintenance of telomeres. This complex is part of the special machinery that some cells use to copy (replicate) telomeres so they do not become too short as cells divide. Studies suggest that the CTC1 protein may also have roles in DNA replication unrelated to telomeres, but these functions are not well understood.","Coats plus syndrome At least 20 mutations in the CTC1 gene have been identified in people with Coats plus syndrome. This disorder is characterized by an eye condition called Coats disease plus abnormalities of the brain, bones, gastrointestinal system, and other parts of the body.Most people with Coats plus syndrome have a mutation in one copy of the CTC1 gene in each cell that eliminates the function of the CTC1 protein and a mutation in the other copy of the gene that reduces but does not eliminate the protein's function. This combination of mutations leaves only a small amount of functional CTC1 protein available to work as part of the CST complex. The resulting impairment of this complex affects the replication of telomeres, although the effect on telomere structure and function is unclear. Some studies have found that people with CTC1 gene mutations have abnormally short telomeres, while other studies have found no change in telomere length. Researchers are working to determine how telomeres are different in people with CTC1 gene mutations and how these changes could underlie the varied signs and symptoms of Coats plus syndrome. "
CTDP1 ,CTD phosphatase subunit 1,"The CTDP1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called carboxy-terminal domain phosphatase 1. This protein helps regulate the activity of an enzyme called RNA polymerase II. The RNA polymerase II enzyme initiates transcription, which is a key step in using the information carried by genes to direct the production (synthesis) of proteins.","Congenital cataracts, facial dysmorphism, and neuropathy Thus far, everyone with CCFDN has had the same mutation in both copies of the CTDP1 gene in each cell. This mutation, written as IVS6+389C>T, alters the way the gene's instructions are pieced together to produce the carboxy-terminal domain phosphatase 1 protein. The altered instructions introduce a premature stop signal, resulting in an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein that cannot regulate transcription. Defective regulation of the transcription process affects the development and function of many parts of the body. It is not known how nonfunctional carboxy-terminal domain phosphatase 1 protein results in the specific signs and symptoms of CCFDN. "
CTNNB1 ,catenin beta 1,"The CTNNB1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called beta-catenin. This protein is present in many types of cells and tissues, where it is primarily found at junctions that connect neighboring cells (adherens junctions). Beta-catenin plays an important role in sticking cells together (cell adhesion) and in communication between cells.The beta-catenin protein is also involved in cell signaling as an essential part of the Wnt signaling pathway. Certain proteins in this pathway attach (bind) to beta-catenin, which triggers a multistep process that allows the protein to move into the cell nucleus. Once in the nucleus, beta-catenin interacts with other proteins to control the activity (expression) of particular genes. The Wnt signaling pathway promotes the growth and division (proliferation) of cells and helps determine the specialized functions a cell will have (differentiation). Wnt signaling is known to be involved in many aspects of development before birth. In adult tissues, this pathway plays a role in the maintenance and renewal of stem cells, which are cells that help repair tissue damage and can give rise to other types of cells.Among its many activities, beta-catenin appears to play an important role in the normal function of hair follicles, which are specialized structures in the skin where hair growth occurs. This protein is active in cells that make up a part of the hair follicle known as the matrix. These cells divide and mature to form the different components of the hair follicle and the hair shaft. As matrix cells divide, the hair shaft is pushed upward and extends beyond the skin.","Desmoid tumor Mutations in the CTNNB1 gene can cause a type of aggressive but noncancerous (benign) growth called a desmoid tumor. CTNNB1 gene mutations are found in about 85 percent of all noninherited (sporadic) desmoid tumors. These rare tumors arise from connective tissue, which provides strength and flexibility to structures such as bones, ligaments, and muscles. The tumors are often found in the abdomen, shoulders, upper arms, or upper legs. The CTNNB1 gene mutations that cause desmoid tumors are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in tumor cells. Somatic mutations are not inherited.The CTNNB1 gene mutations that cause desmoid tumors usually occur in a region of the gene called exon 3. They change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the beta-catenin protein. These mutations lead to an abnormally stable beta-catenin protein that is not broken down when it is no longer needed. As a result, the protein accumulates within cells. Excess beta-catenin promotes the uncontrolled proliferation of cells, allowing the formation of desmoid tumors. "
CTNND1 ,catenin delta 1,"The CTNND1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called p120-catenin, also known as delta 1 catenin. This protein and others in the catenin family interact with proteins from another family called cadherins. Catenins and cadherins form protein complexes that help cells stick to neighboring cells (cell adhesion) to form organized tissues. In addition to their role in cell adhesion, catenin and cadherin interactions help transmit chemical signals within cells, control cell maturation and movement, and regulate the activity of certain genes.The p120-catenin protein interacts with a protein called E-cadherin, which is produced from the CDH1 gene. The E-cadherin protein is found within the membrane that surrounds epithelial cells, which are the cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body, including the inside of the eyelids and the mouth. The p120-catenin protein helps keep E-cadherin in its proper place in the cell membrane, preventing it from being taken into the cell through a process called endocytosis and broken down prematurely. Interactions between the two proteins are also important for other cell processes that are involved in the development of the head and face (craniofacial development), including the eyelids and teeth.","Blepharocheilodontic syndrome At least three CTNND1 gene mutations have been identified in people with blepharocheilodontic (BCD) syndrome, a disorder that is present at birth and causes abnormalities mainly affecting the eyelids and mouth. These mutations are thought to prevent the production of the p120-catenin protein or result in an unstable protein that quickly breaks down. A shortage of p120-catenin protein allows E-cadherin to be taken into the cell and destroyed too quickly by endocytosis. A shortage of these proteins disrupts normal development, especially craniofacial development, which is thought to underlie the features of BCD syndrome. "
CTNND2 ,catenin delta 2,"The CTNND2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called delta-catenin. This protein is active in the nervous system, where it likely helps cells stick together (cell adhesion) and plays a role in cell movement. In the developing brain, it may help guide nerve cells to their proper positions as part of a process known as neuronal migration.In mature nerve cells, delta-catenin is located in specialized outgrowths called dendrites. Dendrites branch out from the cell and receive information from nearby nerve cells. This information is relayed across synapses, which are junctions between nerve cells where cell-to-cell communication occurs. Delta-catenin appears to play a crucial role in the function of synapses.",Autism spectrum disorder Genetics Home Reference provides information about autism spectrum disorder. 
CTNS ,"cystinosin, lysosomal cystine transporter","The CTNS gene provides instructions for making a protein called cystinosin. This protein is located in the membrane of lysosomes, which are compartments in the cell that digest and recycle materials. Proteins digested inside lysosomes are broken down into smaller building blocks, called amino acids. The amino acids are then moved out of lysosomes by transport proteins. Cystinosin is a transport protein that specifically moves the amino acid cystine out of the lysosome.","Cystinosis More than 80 different mutations that are responsible for causing cystinosis have been identified in the CTNS gene. The most common mutation is a deletion of a large part of the CTNS gene (sometimes referred to as the 57-kb deletion), resulting in the complete loss of cystinosin. This deletion is responsible for approximately 50 percent of cystinosis cases in people of European descent. Other mutations result in the production of an abnormally short protein that cannot carry out its normal transport function. Mutations that change very small regions of the CTNS gene may allow the transporter protein to retain some of its usual activity, resulting in a milder form of cystinosis. "
CTSA ,cathepsin A,"The CTSA gene provides instructions for making a protein called cathepsin A. Cathepsin A can act as a protease, cutting apart other proteins in order to break them down. Cathepsin A can also act as a protective protein, interacting with other enzymes to prevent them from breaking down prematurely. Based on this protective function, this enzyme is also called protective protein/cathepsin A or PPCA.Cathepsin A is active in cellular compartments called lysosomes. These compartments contain enzymes that digest and recycle materials when they are no longer needed. Cathepsin A interacts with the enzymes β-galactosidase and neuraminidase 1, which play a role in the breakdown of complexes of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) attached to certain proteins (glycoproteins) or fats (glycolipids). Cathepsin A forms a complex with these two enzymes and directs their transport within the cell to the lysosomes. Within lysosomes, cathepsin A activates the enzymes and prevents their breakdown.On the cell surface, cathepsin A forms a complex with neuraminidase 1 and elastin binding protein, forming the elastin binding protein receptor. This receptor complex plays a role in the formation of elastic fibers, which are a component of the connective tissue that forms the body's supportive framework.","Galactosialidosis At least 20 mutations in the CTSA gene have been found to cause galactosialidosis. Most of these mutations change one protein building block (amino acid) in cathepsin A. In the Japanese population, the most common mutation (written as SpDEx7) disrupts how the gene's instructions are used to make the protein.Many CTSA mutations disrupt the protein structure of cathepsin A, impairing its ability to join with neuraminidase 1 and beta-galactosidase or elastin binding protein. As a result, these other enzymes are not functional or they break down prematurely. Most mutations in the CTSA gene cause a lack of functional cathepsin A and a loss of neuraminidase 1, beta-galactosidase, and elastin binding protein. It is not well understood how a lack of these four proteins causes the signs and symptoms of galactosialidosis. "
CTSD ,cathepsin D,"The CTSD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called cathepsin D. Cathepsin D is one of a family of cathepsin proteins that act as protease enzymes, which modify proteins by cutting them apart. Cathepsin D is found in many types of cells and is active in lysosomes, which are compartments within cells that digest and recycle different types of molecules. By cutting proteins apart, cathepsin D can break down certain proteins, turn on (activate) other proteins, and regulate self-destruction of the cell (apoptosis).Cathepsin D is produced as an inactive enzyme, called a preproenzyme, which has extra protein segments attached. These segments must be removed, followed by additional processing steps, for the enzyme to become active. The mature, active cathepsin D enzyme is made up of two parts, one light chain and one heavy chain.","CLN10 disease At least seven mutations in the CTSD gene have been found to cause CLN10 disease. The signs and symptoms of CLN10 disease are usually present at birth and include muscle rigidity, respiratory failure, and severe seizures; death typically occurs in infancy. Rarely, CLN10 disease can develop later in life with poor coordination and balance (ataxia), loss of speech, a gradual loss in intellectual functioning (cognitive decline), and vision loss.CTSD gene mutations found to cause CLN10 disease that is present at birth lead to a complete lack of cathepsin D enzyme activity. As a result, proteins and fats are not broken down properly and abnormally accumulate within lysosomes. While these substances accumulate in cells throughout the body, nerve cells appear to be particularly vulnerable to damage caused by the abnormal cell materials. Early and widespread loss of nerve cells in CLN10 disease leads to severe signs and symptoms and death in infancy.In the later-onset cases of CLN10 disease, CTSD gene mutations likely result in the production of a cathepsin D enzyme whose function is greatly reduced but not eliminated. As a result, some proteins and fats are broken down by the enzyme, so it takes longer for these substances to accumulate in lysosomes and cause nerve cell death. "
CUBN ,cubilin,"The CUBN gene provides instructions for making a protein called cubilin. This protein is involved in the uptake of vitamin B12 (also called cobalamin) from food into the body. Vitamin B12, which cannot be made in the body and can only be obtained from food, is essential for the formation of DNA and proteins, the production of cellular energy, and the breakdown of fats. This vitamin is involved in the formation of red blood cells and maintenance of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).The cubilin protein is primarily found associated with kidney cells and cells that line the small intestine. Cubilin is anchored to the outer membrane of these cells by its attachment to another protein called amnionless. Cubilin can interact with molecules and proteins passing through the small intestine and kidneys, including vitamin B12. During digestion, vitamin B12 is released from food. As the vitamin passes through the small intestine, cubilin attaches (binds) to it. Amnionless helps transfer the cubilin-vitamin B12 complex into the intestinal cell. From there, the vitamin is released into the blood and transported throughout the body. In the kidneys, cubilin and amnionless are involved in the reabsorption of certain proteins that would otherwise be released in urine.","Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome At least 35 mutations in the CUBN gene have been found to cause a condition called Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome. This condition is characterized by low levels of vitamin B12 in the body, which leads to a blood disorder known as megaloblastic anemia. About half of affected individuals also have excess protein in their urine (proteinuria), and some have neurological problems.The most common CUBN gene mutation, which is found in people of Finnish heritage, changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the cubilin protein; the amino acid proline is replaced by the amino acid leucine at position 1297 (written as Pro1297Leu or P1297L). The protein alteration impairs cubilin's ability to bind to vitamin B12. Instead of being taken up into intestinal cells, the vitamin is released from the body. A shortage of this essential vitamin impairs the proper development of red blood cells, leading to megaloblastic anemia. In addition, low levels of vitamin B12 can affect the central nervous system, causing neurological problems.Other CUBN gene mutations prevent cubilin from attaching to the amnionless protein or lead to a reduction in the amount or function of the cubilin protein. These changes impair cubilin's function in the kidneys as well as in the small intestine. Without amnionless function in the kidneys, proteins are not reabsorbed into the body and are instead released in the urine, leading to proteinuria. Individuals with these mutations develop megaloblastic anemia and proteinuria. "
CUL3 ,cullin 3,"The CUL3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cullin-3. This protein plays a role in the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unwanted proteins, called the ubiquitin-proteasome system.Cullin-3 is a core piece of a complex known as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. E3 ubiquitin ligases function as part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system by tagging damaged and excess proteins with molecules called ubiquitin. Ubiquitin serves as a signal to specialized cell structures known as proteasomes, which attach (bind) to the tagged proteins and degrade them. The ubiquitin-proteasome system acts as the cell's quality control system by disposing of damaged, misshapen, and excess proteins. This system also regulates the level of proteins involved in several critical cell activities such as the timing of cell division and growth.E3 ubiquitin ligases containing the cullin-3 protein tag proteins called WNK1 and WNK4 with ubiquitin. These proteins are involved in controlling blood pressure in the body. By regulating the amount of WNK1 and WNK4 available, cullin-3 plays a role in blood pressure control.","Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 At least 17 mutations in the CUL3 gene can cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 (PHA2), a condition characterized by high blood pressure (hypertension) and high levels of potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia). These mutations lead to production of an abnormally short cullin-3 protein that is missing a region. Studies show that this change alters the function of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The change leads to impaired degradation of the WNK4 protein, although the exact mechanism is unclear. The resulting excess of WNK4 protein disrupts normal control of blood pressure, causing hypertension and other features of PHA2. It is unknown if WNK1 is affected by the alterations to the E3 ubiquitin ligase or whether WNK1 plays a role in PHA2 caused by CUL3 gene mutations. "
CUL7 ,cullin 7,"The CUL7 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cullin-7. This protein plays a role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unwanted proteins.Cullin-7 helps assemble a complex known as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This complex tags damaged and excess proteins with molecules called ubiquitin. Ubiquitin serves as a signal to specialized cell structures known as proteasomes, which attach (bind) to the tagged proteins and degrade them. The ubiquitin-proteasome system acts as the cell's quality control system by disposing of damaged, misshapen, and excess proteins. This system also regulates the level of proteins involved in several critical cell activities such as the timing of cell division and growth. In particular, cullin-7 is thought to help regulate proteins involved in the body's response to growth hormones, although its specific role in this process is unknown.","3-M syndrome At least 73 mutations in the CUL7 gene have been identified in people with 3-M syndrome, a disorder that causes skeletal anomalies including short stature (dwarfism) and unusual facial features. Most of these mutations substitute one protein building block (amino acid) for another amino acid in the cullin-7 protein or result in a cullin-7 protein that is abnormally short and nonfunctional.Individuals in the Yakut population of the Russian province of Siberia with a variant of 3-M syndrome all have a particular mutation in both copies of the CUL7 gene in each cell. This mutation replaces the amino acid glutamine with a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the cullin-7 protein (written as Gln1553Ter or Q1553X), leading to production of an abnormally short protein.Mutations in the CUL7 gene, including the Gln1553Ter mutation, prevent the cullin-7 protein from bringing together the components of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, interfering with the process of tagging unneeded proteins for degradation. The body's response to growth hormones may be impaired as a result. However, the specific relationship between CUL7 gene mutations and the signs and symptoms of 3-M syndrome are unknown. "
CXCR4 ,C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4,"The CXCR4 gene provides instructions for making a receptor protein that spans the outer membrane of cells, specifically white blood cells and cells in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. After attachment of its ligand, called SDF-1, the CXCR4 protein turns on (activates) signaling pathways inside the cell. These pathways help regulate cell growth and division (proliferation), the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and cell survival. Once signaling is stimulated, the CXCR4 protein is removed from the cell membrane (internalized) and broken down so it can no longer activate the signaling pathways.The CXCR4 receptor is also involved in the movement (migration) of cells. Cells that have the CXCR4 protein in their membrane are attracted to SDF-1. High levels of this ligand are found in the bone marrow, which helps certain blood cells migrate to and stay in the bone marrow until they are needed elsewhere in the body. Retention of early blood cells known as hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow is important to ensure that stem cells are available when needed. White blood cells also remain in the bone marrow until they are needed in the body to fight infection.","Waldenström macroglobulinemia Mutations in the CXCR4 gene are found in approximately 30 percent of people with Waldenström macroglobulinemia. This rare form of blood cancer is characterized by an excess of abnormal white blood cells called lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone marrow and overproduction of a protein called IgM. These mutations are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in the abnormal white blood cells. This type of genetic change, called a somatic mutation, is not inherited. Waldenström macroglobulinemia is thought to result from multiple genetic changes, one of which can be a CXCR4 gene mutation.CXCR4 gene mutations involved in Waldenström macroglobulinemia lead to production of an abnormally short CXCR4 protein that cannot be internalized, prolonging signaling activated by the protein. This signaling leads to enhanced survival and proliferation of cells containing the abnormal protein, which may contribute to the abundance of lymphoplasmacytic cells characteristic of Waldenström macroglobulinemia. "
CYB5R3 ,cytochrome b5 reductase 3,"The CYB5R3 gene provides instruction for making an enzyme called cytochrome b5 reductase 3. This enzyme is involved in transferring negatively charged particles called electrons from one molecule to another. Two versions (isoforms) of this enzyme are produced from the CYB5R3 gene. The soluble isoform is present only in red blood cells, and the membrane-bound isoform is found in all other cell types.Normal red blood cells contain molecules of iron-containing hemoglobin, which deliver oxygen to the body's tissues. The iron in hemoglobin is ferrous (Fe2+), but it can spontaneously become ferric (Fe3+). Hemoglobin that contains ferric iron is called methemoglobin, and it cannot deliver oxygen. The soluble isoform of cytochrome b5 reductase 3 changes ferric iron back to ferrous iron so hemoglobin can function. Normally, red blood cells contain less than 2 percent methemoglobin.The membrane-bound isoform is embedded in the membranes of various cellular compartments and is widely used in the body. This isoform is necessary for many chemical reactions, including the breakdown and formation of fatty acids, the formation of cholesterol, and the breakdown of various molecules and drugs.","Autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia More than 65 mutations in the CYB5R3 gene have been found to cause autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia types I and II. Most of these CYB5R3 gene mutations cause autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia type I, which is characterized by a lack of oxygen in the body's tissues and bluish appearance of the skin, lips, and nails (cyanosis). The mutations that cause type I usually reduce enzyme activity or stability. As a result, the enzyme cannot efficiently change ferric iron to ferrous iron, leading to a 10 to 50 percent increase in methemoglobin within red blood cells. This increase in methemoglobin and corresponding decrease in normal hemoglobin reduces the amount of oxygen delivered to tissues. The altered enzyme activity affects only red blood cells because other cells can compensate for a decrease in enzyme activity, but red blood cells cannot.The CYB5R3 gene mutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia type II result in the more severe form of the two types. In addition to cyanosis, people with this form have neurological problems. The mutations that cause type II typically result in a complete loss of enzyme activity. Cells cannot compensate for a complete loss of cytochrome b5 reductase 3, which results in a 10 to 70 percent increase in methemoglobin within red blood cells. This increase in methemoglobin and corresponding decrease in normal hemoglobin leads to cyanosis. The lack of enzyme activity in other cells leads to the neurological features associated with type II. Researchers suspect that the neurological problems are caused by impaired fatty acid and cholesterol formation, which reduces the production of a fatty substance called myelin. Myelin insulates nerve cells and promotes the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. This reduced ability to form myelin (hypomyelination) leads to a loss of nerve cells, particularly in the brain. The loss of these cells likely contributes to the encephalopathy and movement disorders characteristic of autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia type II. "
CYBA ,cytochrome b-245 alpha chain,"The CYBA gene provides instructions for making a protein called the cytochrome b-245 alpha chain (also known as p22-phox). This protein is one part (subunit) of a group of proteins that forms an enzyme complex called NADPH oxidase, which plays an essential role in the immune system. Within this complex, the cytochrome b-245 alpha chain has a beta chain partner (produced from the CYBB gene). Both alpha and beta chains are required for either to function, and the NADPH oxidase complex requires both chains in order to be functional. NADPH oxidase is primarily active in immune system cells called phagocytes. These cells catch and destroy foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi. NADPH oxidase is also thought to regulate the activity of immune cells called neutrophils. These cells play a role in adjusting the inflammatory response to optimize healing and reduce injury to the body.The presence of foreign invaders stimulates phagocytes and triggers the assembly of NADPH oxidase. This enzyme participates in a chemical reaction that converts oxygen to a toxic molecule called superoxide. Superoxide is used to generate several other compounds, including hydrogen peroxide (a strong disinfectant) and hypochlorous acid (the active ingredient in bleach). These highly reactive, toxic substances are known as reactive oxygen species. Phagocytes use these substances to kill foreign invaders, preventing them from reproducing in the body and causing illness.","Chronic granulomatous disease More than 40 mutations in the CYBA gene have been found to cause chronic granulomatous disease. People with this disorder are at increased risk of developing recurrent episodes of infection and inflammation due to a weakened immune system. Mutations in the CYBA gene cause less than 5 percent of all cases of this condition. Most of these mutations change single building blocks of protein (amino acids) in the cytochrome b-245 alpha chain or cause it to be abnormally short and nonfunctional. An altered protein not only diminishes the function of the alpha chain, but the function of its beta chain partner as well. Without these subunits, NADPH oxidase cannot assemble or function properly. As a result, phagocytes are unable to produce reactive oxygen species to kill foreign invaders, and neutrophil activity is not regulated. A lack of NADPH oxidase leaves affected individuals vulnerable to many types of infection and excessive inflammation. "
CYBB ,cytochrome b-245 beta chain,"The CYBB gene provides instructions for making a protein called cytochrome b-245, beta chain (also known as p91-phox). This protein is one part (subunit) of a group of proteins that forms an enzyme complex called NADPH oxidase, which plays an essential role in the immune system. Within this complex, the cytochrome b-245, beta chain has an alpha chain partner (produced from the CYBA gene). Both alpha and beta chains are required for either to function and the NADPH oxidase complex requires both chains in order to be functional. NADPH oxidase is primarily active in immune system cells called phagocytes. These cells catch and destroy foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi. NADPH oxidase is also thought to regulate the activity of immune cells called neutrophils. These cells play a role in adjusting the inflammatory response to optimize healing and reduce injury to the body.The presence of foreign invaders stimulates phagocytes and triggers the assembly of NADPH oxidase. This enzyme participates in a chemical reaction that converts oxygen to a toxic molecule called superoxide. Superoxide is used to generate several other compounds, including hydrogen peroxide (a strong disinfectant) and hypochlorous acid (the active ingredient in bleach). These highly reactive, toxic substances are known as reactive oxygen species. Phagocytes use these substances to kill foreign invaders, preventing them from reproducing in the body and causing illness.","Chronic granulomatous disease More than 650 mutations in the CYBB gene have been found to cause chronic granulomatous disease. People with this disorder are at increased risk of developing recurrent episodes of infection and inflammation due to a weakened immune system. Mutations in the CYBB gene cause approximately 70 percent of all cases of this condition. Most of these mutations change single building blocks of protein (amino acids) in the cytochrome b-245 beta chain or cause it to be abnormally short and nonfunctional. An altered protein not only diminishes the function of the beta chain, but the function of its alpha chain partner as well. Without these subunits, NADPH oxidase cannot assemble or function properly. As a result, phagocytes are unable to produce reactive oxygen species to kill foreign invaders, and neutrophil activity is not regulated. A lack of NADPH oxidase leaves affected individuals vulnerable to many types of infection and excessive inflammation. "
CYLD ,CYLD lysine 63 deubiquitinase,"The CYLD gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps regulate nuclear factor-kappa-B. Nuclear factor-kappa-B is a group of related proteins that help protect cells from self-destruction (apoptosis) in response to certain signals. In regulating the action of nuclear factor-kappa-B, the CYLD protein allows cells to respond properly to signals to self-destruct when appropriate, such as when the cells become abnormal. By this mechanism, the CYLD protein acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it helps prevent cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way.","Brooke-Spiegler syndrome At least 20 CYLD gene mutations have been identified in individuals with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome. This condition is characterized by multiple noncancerous (benign) tumors that develop in structures associated with the skin (skin appendages), such as sweat glands and hair follicles. People with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome may develop several types of skin appendage tumors, including growths called spiradenomas, trichoepitheliomas, and cylindromas. Spiradenomas are tumors of the sweat glands. Trichoepitheliomas arise from the hair follicles. While previously thought to derive from sweat glands, cylindromas are now generally believed to begin in hair follicles.People with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome are born with a mutation in one of the two copies of the CYLD gene in each cell. This mutation prevents the cell from making functional CYLD protein from the altered copy of the gene. However, enough protein is usually produced from the other, normal copy of the gene to regulate cell growth effectively. For tumors to develop, a second mutation or deletion of genetic material involving the other copy of the CYLD gene must occur in certain cells during a person's lifetime. These genetic changes are called somatic mutations and are not inherited.When both copies of the CYLD gene are mutated in a particular cell, that cell cannot produce any functional CYLD protein. The loss of this protein impairs the regulation of nuclear factor-kappa-B, allowing the cell to grow and divide in an uncontrolled way to form a tumor. In people with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, second CYLD mutations typically occur in different types of cells in the skin over an affected person's lifetime, leading to the growth of multiple types of skin appendage tumors. "
CYP1B1 ,cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily B member 1,"The CYP1B1 gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme that is a member of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. These enzymes are involved in many processes in the body, such as assisting with reactions that break down drugs and produce certain fats (lipids). The CYP1B1 enzyme participates in biochemical reactions in which an oxygen atom is added to other molecules.The CYP1B1 enzyme is active in many tissues, including structures of the eye. The function of the CYP1B1 enzyme in the development of the eye is unclear, but it may play a role in forming structures at the front of the eye and may also be involved in a process that regulates the secretion of fluid inside the eye.","Early-onset glaucoma More than 140 CYP1B1 gene mutations have been identified to cause early-onset glaucoma. People with this condition experience increased pressure within the eye before the age of 40. This pressure causes damage to the optic nerves connecting the eyes and the brain. Between 20 percent and 40 percent of people with glaucoma before the age of 5 (primary congenital glaucoma) have mutations in the CYP1B1 gene. The mutations that cause early-onset glaucoma may result in an enzyme that is unstable or the wrong shape.It is not well understood how defects in the CYP1B1 enzyme cause signs and symptoms of glaucoma. Recent studies suggest that the defects may interfere with the early development of the trabecular meshwork, which is a network of mesh-like canals that helps drain excess fluid from the eye. If fluid cannot be drained, pressure inside the eye may increase, which is characteristic of glaucoma.The CYP1B1 enzyme may interact with another protein called myocilin, which is produced from the MYOC gene. Individuals with mutations in both the MYOC and CYP1B1 genes may develop glaucoma at an earlier age and have more severe symptoms than do those with mutations in only one of the genes. "
CYP2C9 ,cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C member 9,"The CYP2C9 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found in a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein processing and transport. The CYP2C9 enzyme breaks down (metabolizes) compounds including steroid hormones and fatty acids. The CYP2C9 enzyme also plays a major role in breaking down the drug warfarin, which thins the blood and prevents blood clots from forming. This enzyme also assists in metabolizing other drugs such as ibuprofen, which reduces inflammation.","Warfarin sensitivity Certain common CYP2C9 gene variations (polymorphisms) have been associated with warfarin sensitivity, a condition in which individuals require lower doses of the drug warfarin than are usually prescribed. Warfarin is an anticoagulant, which means that it thins the blood, preventing blood clots from forming.The CYP2C9 gene polymorphisms associated with warfarin sensitivity change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the CYP2C9 enzyme. The altered enzyme slows the breakdown (metabolism) of warfarin, allowing the drug to remain active in the body for a longer period of time. People with warfarin sensitivity take longer than usual to metabolize warfarin and may require lower doses of the drug than are usually prescribed.The two most common CYP2C9 polymorphisms in people of European ancestry are known as CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3. Both of these polymorphisms lead to a decrease in warfarin metabolism to such degrees that prescription doses are typically reduced by one-third and one-fifth, respectively. In individuals with African ancestry, the four most common CYP2C9 polymorphisms associated with warfarin sensitivity are known as CYP2C9*5, CYP2C9*6, CYP2C9*8, and CYP2C9*11. These polymorphisms lead to a decrease in warfarin metabolism that would necessitate a reduction in prescription doses by one-third to one-sixth. In other populations, the effects of these polymorphisms are less certain but are an active area of research.In rare cases in which individuals have more than one CYP2C9 polymorphisms, the enzyme activity is severely decreased and metabolism of warfarin is very slow. If people with warfarin sensitivity take the average dose (or more) of warfarin, they are at risk of an overdose, which can cause abnormal bleeding in the brain, gastrointestinal tract, or other tissues, and may lead to serious health problems or death.

CYP2C19 ,cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C member 19,"The CYP2C19 gene is a member of the cytochrome P450 gene family. Enzymes produced from cytochrome P450 genes are involved in the formation and breakdown (metabolism) of various molecules and chemicals within cells. The CYP2C19 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found primarily in liver cells in a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein processing and transport.The CYP2C19 enzyme plays a role in the processing or metabolizing of at least 10 percent of commonly prescribed drugs, including a drug called clopidogrel (also known as Plavix). Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet drug, which means that it prevents blood cells called platelets from sticking together (aggregating) and forming blood clots. The CYP2C19 enzyme converts clopidogrel to its active form, which is necessary for the drug to function in the body. The active drug then stops (inhibits) a receptor protein known as P2RY12 that is found on the surface of platelets. During clot formation, the P2RY12 receptor protein helps platelets cluster together to form a clot in order to seal off damaged blood vessels and prevent blood loss.","Clopidogrel resistance Multiple variations (polymorphisms) in the CYP2C19 gene have been associated with clopidogrel resistance, a condition in which the drug clopidogrel is less effective than normal in people who are treated with it. The polymorphisms that are associated with clopidogrel resistance decrease the enzyme's ability to convert the drug to its active form.The normal version of the gene, written as CYP2C19*1, provides instructions for producing a normally functioning CYP2C19 enzyme. If a person has two copies of the CYP2C19*1 version of the gene in each cell, they are able to convert clopidogrel normally. The two most common CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms associated with clopidogrel resistance (known as CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3) result in the production of a nonfunctional CYP2C19 enzyme that is unable to activate clopidogrel.Individuals with clopidogrel resistance can be classified into two groups: intermediate metabolizers or poor metabolizers. People who have one copy of the CYP2C19*1 version of the gene and one copy of either the CYP2C19*2 or CYP2C19*3 version of the gene have a reduced ability to convert clopidogrel to its active form and are classified as intermediate metabolizers. People who have the CYP2C19*2 or CYP2C19*3 versions of the gene for both copies of the gene can convert very little or none of the drug and are classified as poor metabolizers. Because conversion of clopidogrel to its active form is impaired in people with clopidogrel resistance, the drug is unable to inhibit P2RY12 receptor function. Without active clopidogrel to interfere, the P2RY12 receptor continues to promote platelet aggregation and blood clot formation, which can lead to heart attacks, strokes, and thromboses in individuals with a history of these conditions.It is important to note that not all individuals with CYP2C19 gene mutations have clopidogrel resistance. These individuals who are at increased risk for developing clopidogrel resistance may or may not have a bad reaction when treated with the drug. In addition to changes in specific genes, many other factors, including gender, age, weight, diet, and other medications, play a role in how the body reacts to clopidogrel. "
CYP2R1 ,cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily R member 1,"The CYP2R1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 25-hydroxylase. This enzyme carries out the first of two reactions to convert vitamin D to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, also known as calcitriol. Vitamin D can be acquired from foods in the diet or can be made in the body with the help of sunlight exposure. When active, this vitamin is involved in maintaining the proper balance of several minerals in the body, including calcium and phosphate, which are essential for the normal formation of bones and teeth. One of vitamin D's major roles is to control the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the intestines into the bloodstream. Vitamin D is also involved in several processes unrelated to bone and tooth formation.","Vitamin D-dependent rickets At least four mutations in the CYP2R1 gene have been found to cause vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1B (VDDR1B). This disorder of bone development is characterized by low levels of calcium (hypocalcemia) and phosphate (hypophosphatemia) in the blood, which lead to soft, weak bones that are prone to fracture. A common feature of this condition is abnormally curved (bowed) legs.The CYP2R1 gene mutations that cause this condition severely reduce or eliminate the function of 25-hydroxylase. As a result, vitamin D does not get converted to its active form and cannot control mineral absorption. The resulting reduction in calcium and phosphate absorption from the intestines means there is less of these minerals to be deposited in developing bones (bone mineralization), which leads to soft, weak bones and other features of VDDR1B. Hypocalcemia also causes muscle weakness in some affected individuals. "
CYP4V2 ,cytochrome P450 family 4 subfamily V member 2,"The CYP4V2 gene provides instructions for making a member of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. These enzymes are involved in the formation and breakdown of various molecules and chemicals within cells. The CYP4V2 enzyme is involved in a multi-step process called fatty acid oxidation in which fats are broken down and converted into energy, but the enzyme's specific function is not well understood.","Bietti crystalline dystrophy At least 42 CYP4V2 gene mutations have been identified in people with Bietti crystalline dystrophy, a disorder in which numerous small, yellow or white crystal-like deposits of fatty (lipid) compounds accumulate in the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (the retina). The deposits damage the retina, resulting in progressive vision loss.CYP4V2 gene mutations that cause Bietti crystalline dystrophy are predicted to change the structure of the CYP4V2 enzyme in a way that reduces or eliminates its activity. The mutations likely affect lipid breakdown; however, it is unknown how they lead to the specific signs and symptoms of Bietti crystalline dystrophy. For unknown reasons, the severity of the signs and symptoms differs significantly among individuals with the same CYP4V2 gene mutation. "
CYP7B1 ,cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1,"The CYP7B1 gene is a member of the cytochrome P450 gene family. Enzymes produced from cytochrome P450 genes are involved in the formation and breakdown of various molecules and chemicals within cells. The CYP7B1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called oxysterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase. This enzyme is produced primarily in the liver and the brain. In the liver, oxysterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase is involved in the pathway that breaks down a waxy, fat-like substance called cholesterol to form a bile acid called chenodeoxycholic acid. Bile acids are a component of a digestive fluid called bile that digests fats.In the brain, oxysterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase is also involved in a pathway that converts cholesterol to hormones called neurosteroids. Neurosteroids increase nerve cell activity (excitability) and promote cell survival and communication between nerve cells. The enzyme primarily converts the neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) into 7-hydroxy-DHEA. Oxysterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase helps maintain normal cholesterol levels in the brain and, by producing neurosteroids through altering existing hormones within the pathway, regulates the effects of neurosteroids on the brain.","Spastic paraplegia type 5A At least 37 mutations in the CYP7B1 gene have been found to cause spastic paraplegia type 5A. This condition is characterized by muscle stiffness (spasticity) and severe weakness of the lower limbs (paraplegia), typically beginning in adolescence. Most CYP7B1 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the oxysterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase enzyme. Such changes reduce the enzyme's activity. Other mutations result in a complete loss of functional enzyme.Reduced oxysterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase enzyme activity does not seem to affect cholesterol breakdown or bile acid production in the liver. Another pathway in the liver can perform these functions, which may explain why reduction of oxysterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase activity does not impact liver function.In the brain, a decrease in enzyme activity results in an accumulation of cholesterol and alters neurosteroid production triggered by oxysterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase. Abnormal levels of neurosteroids impairs cell survival, likely leading to nerve cell death. The abnormal buildup of cholesterol in the brain probably also contributes to the death of nerve cells. The loss of these cells results in the deterioration of nervous system functions (neurodegeneration) and causes the movement problems, weakness, and other signs and symptoms characteristic of spastic paraplegia type 5A. "
CYP11B1 ,cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily B member 1,"The CYP11B1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 11-beta-hydroxylase. This enzyme is found in the adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys. The 11-beta-hydroxylase enzyme is a member of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. These enzymes are involved in the formation and breakdown of various molecules within cells.The 11-beta-hydroxylase enzyme helps produce hormones called cortisol and corticosterone. Specifically, the enzyme helps convert a molecule called 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol, and helps convert another molecule called 11-deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone. These processes are triggered by the release of a hormone called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain.Cortisol helps maintain blood sugar levels, protects the body from physical stress, and suppresses inflammation. Corticosterone is converted to the hormone aldosterone by the aldosterone synthase enzyme, which is produced from the nearby CYP11B2 gene. Aldosterone helps control blood pressure by maintaining proper salt and fluid levels in the body.","Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency More than 80 mutations in the CYP11B1 gene have been found to cause congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency, a disorder in which the adrenal glands produce excess male sex hormones (androgens). Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the 11-beta-hydroxylase enzyme and decrease the function of the enzyme. CYP11B1 gene mutations that severely reduce or eliminate the function of the enzyme typically result in the classic form of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency. Mutations that allow for some enzyme function usually result in the non-classic form of the disorder.Some mutations that cause the classic form of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency fuse sections of the CYP11B1 gene with sections of a nearby gene called CYP11B2. The added part of the CYP11B2 gene contains a section called a promoter region, which normally controls (regulates) production of the protein made by the CYP11B2 gene. As a result, the CYP11B1 gene is regulated by the CYP11B2 gene promoter region rather than its own promoter region. In addition, the fusion typically deletes parts of the CYP11B1 gene. These changes in the gene's regulation and structure diminish production of 11-beta-hydroxylase.Both types of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency interfere with the production of cortisol and corticosterone. The molecules that are used to form these hormones instead build up in the adrenal gland and are converted to androgens. The excess production of androgens leads to abnormalities of sexual development in people with CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency. A buildup of the molecule 11-deoxycorticosterone, the substance that 11-beta-hydroxylase converts to form corticosterone, increases salt retention, leading to high blood pressure (hypertension) in individuals with the classic form of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency. "
CYP11B2 ,cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily B member 2,"The CYP11B2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aldosterone synthase (previously known as corticosterone methyloxidase). This enzyme is found in the adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys. Aldosterone synthase is a member of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. These enzymes are involved in the formation and breakdown of various molecules within cells.Aldosterone synthase helps produce a hormone called aldosterone. Aldosterone helps control blood pressure by maintaining proper salt and fluid levels in the body. The aldosterone synthase enzyme is involved in a series of three chemical reactions that produce aldosterone from other (precursor) molecules: the conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone, the conversion of corticosterone to 18-hydroxycorticosterone, and the conversion of 18-hydroxycorticosterone to aldosterone.","Corticosterone methyloxidase deficiency At least 30 CYP11B2 gene mutations that cause corticosterone methyloxidase deficiency (also known as aldosterone synthase deficiency) have been identified. These mutations lead to insufficient production of aldosterone, which impairs the kidneys' ability to reabsorb salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) into the blood and release potassium in the urine. As a result, excessive amounts of salt in the form of charged atoms (ions) of sodium (Na+) and chlorine (Cl-) leave the body in the urine, while not enough potassium is released. The resulting imbalance of ions in the body underlies the signs and symptoms of this disorder, which include nausea, vomiting, dehydration, low blood pressure, extreme tiredness (fatigue), and muscle weakness. "
CYP17A1 ,cytochrome P450 family 17 subfamily A member 1,"The CYP17A1 gene provides instructions for making a member of the cytochrome P450 enzyme family. Like other cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP17A1 is involved in the formation (synthesis) of steroid hormones. This group of hormones includes sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogen, which are needed for normal sexual development and reproduction; mineralocorticoids, which help regulate the body's salt and water balance; and glucocorticoids, which are involved in maintaining blood sugar levels and regulating the body's response to stress.Steroid hormones are synthesized through a series of chemical reactions. The CYP17A1 enzyme performs two important reactions in this process. The enzyme has 17 alpha(α)-hydroxylase activity, converting pregnenalone to 17-hydroxypregnenolone and progesterone to 17-hydroxyprogesterone. These hormone precursors are further processed to produce glucocorticoids and sex hormones. CYP17A1 also has 17,20-lyase activity, which converts 17-hydroxypregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). This reaction is integral to the production of sex hormones.","17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency Dozens of mutations in the CYP17A1 gene have been found to cause 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency. This condition affects the function of certain hormone-producing glands, leading to high blood pressure (hypertension) and abnormal sexual development. Mutations associated with this condition reduce or eliminate both 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activity. Reduction of these activities leads to partial 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency, while total loss of these activities leads to the more severe form of the disorder known as complete 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency.Without 17α-hydroxylase activity, pregnenolone and progesterone are not converted to 17-hydroxypregnenolone or 17-hydroxyprogesterone, impairing production of glucocorticoids. Instead pregnenolone and progesterone are processed to form mineralocorticoids. An excess of these salt-regulating hormones leads to hypertension and low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia).A loss of 17,20-lyase activity impairs sex hormone production. In females, a lack of female sex hormones disrupts development of internal reproductive organs (the ovaries and uterus) and secondary sex characteristics, such as breasts and menstrual periods. In chromosomal males (individuals with an X and a Y chromosome), a lack of male sex hormones leads to abnormal development of external genitalia. Depending on the severity of the condition, these affected individuals can have abnormal male genitalia, genitalia that do not look clearly male or clearly female (ambiguous genitalia), or characteristically female genitalia. "
CYP19A1 ,cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A member 1,"The CYP19A1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aromatase. This enzyme converts a class of hormones called androgens, which are involved in male sexual development, to different forms of the female sex hormone estrogen.In cells, aromatase is found in a structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein production, processing, and transport. The activity (expression) of aromatase varies among different cell types depending on the cells' need for estrogen. In females, aromatase is most active in the ovaries, where it guides sexual development. In males, aromatase is most active in fat (adipose) tissue. In both males and females, estrogen plays a role in regulating bone growth and blood sugar levels. During fetal development, aromatase converts androgens to estrogens in the placenta, which is the link between the mother's blood supply and the fetus. This conversion in the placenta prevents androgens from directing sexual development in female fetuses. After birth, the conversion of androgens to estrogens takes place in multiple tissues.","Aromatase deficiency More than 20 mutations in the CYP19A1 gene have been found to cause aromatase deficiency. This condition is characterized by reduced levels of estrogen and increased levels of androgens. These abnormal hormone levels lead to impaired sexual development in affected females and unusual bone growth, insulin resistance, and other signs and symptoms in both males and females with the condition. CYP19A1 gene mutations that cause aromatase deficiency decrease or eliminate aromatase activity. A lack of aromatase function results in an inability to convert androgens to estrogens before birth and throughout life. As a result, there is a decrease in estrogen production and an increase in the levels of androgens, including testosterone. In women who are pregnant with an affected fetus, excess androgens in the placenta pass into the woman's bloodstream, and may cause her to have temporary signs and symptoms of aromatase deficiency. "
CYP21A2 ,cytochrome P450 family 21 subfamily A member 2,"The CYP21A2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase, which is part of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in many processes in the body, such as assisting with reactions that break down drugs and helping to produce cholesterol, certain hormones, and fats (lipids).The 21-hydroxylase enzyme is found in the adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys and produce a variety of hormones that regulate many essential functions in the body. 21-hydroxylase plays a role in producing hormones called cortisol and aldosterone. Cortisol helps maintain blood sugar levels, protects the body from stress, and suppresses inflammation. Aldosterone is sometimes called the salt-retaining hormone because it regulates the amount of salt retained by the kidneys. The retention of salt affects fluid levels in the body and blood pressure.","21-hydroxylase deficiency More than 100 mutations in the CYP21A2 gene have been found to cause 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Some of these mutations result from an exchange of genetic material between the CYP21A2 gene and a similar but nonfunctional piece of DNA called a pseudogene, which is located very close to the CYP21A2 gene on chromosome 6. This type of DNA exchange is called a gene conversion. The genetic material from the pseudogene contains errors that, when introduced into the CYP21A2 gene, disrupt the way the gene's instructions are used to make a protein. Other mutations that cause 21-hydroxylase deficiency change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the 21-hydroxylase enzyme or delete or insert pieces of DNA in the CYP21A2 gene.Researchers have described three forms of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Individuals with a form of the disorder called the salt-wasting type have CYP21A2 mutations that result in a completely nonfunctional enzyme. People with the simple virilizing type of this condition have CYP21A2 gene mutations that allow the production of low levels of functional enzyme. Individuals with the non-classic type of this disorder have CYP21A2 mutations that result in the production of reduced amounts of the enzyme, but more enzyme than any of the other types. All types of 21-hydroxylase deficiency interfere with the production of cortisol and aldosterone. The substances that are usually used to form these hormones instead build up in the adrenal glands and are converted to androgens, which are male sex hormones. The excess production of androgens leads to abnormalities of sexual development in people with 21-hydroxylase deficiency. "
CYP24A1 ,cytochrome P450 family 24 subfamily A member 1,"The CYP24A1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 24-hydroxylase. This enzyme helps control the amount of active vitamin D available in the body. When active, vitamin D is involved in maintaining the proper balance of several minerals in the body, including calcium and phosphate, which are essential for the normal formation of bones and teeth. One of vitamin D's major roles is to control the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the intestines into the bloodstream. Vitamin D is also involved in several processes in addition to bone and tooth formation.The 24-hydroxylase enzyme breaks down the active form of vitamin D, called 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or calcitriol, to an inactive form when the vitamin is no longer needed. The enzyme also breaks down 25-hydroxyvitamin D (also known as calcidiol), which is the form of vitamin D that is stored in the body.","Idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia More than 20 mutations in the CYP24A1 gene have been found to cause a type of idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia called infantile hypercalcemia 1, which is characterized by high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia) and urine (hypercalciuria) and deposits of calcium in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis). The hypercalcemia typically causes vomiting, poor feeding, and an inability to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive) in infancy, although some affected individuals do not develop signs and symptoms of the condition until adulthood. Features in affected adults, whether they had symptoms in infancy or not, typically include hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and kidney stones (nephrolithiasis), although they may not cause any obvious health problems.The CYP24A1 gene mutations that cause infantile hypercalcemia 1 reduce or eliminate the activity of the 24-hydroxylase enzyme. A shortage of this enzyme's function impairs the breakdown of calcitriol. The resulting excess of calcitriol increases calcium absorption into the bloodstream, causing hypercalcemia. Dysregulation of calcium absorption in the kidneys leads to hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and nephrolithiasis. "
CYP27A1 ,cytochrome P450 family 27 subfamily A member 1,"The CYP27A1 gene is a member of the cytochrome P450 gene family. Enzymes produced from the cytochrome P450 genes are involved in the formation and breakdown of various molecules and chemicals within cells. The CYP27A1 gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called sterol 27-hydroxylase. This enzyme is located in the energy-producing centers of cells (mitochondria), where it is involved in the pathway that breaks down cholesterol to form acids used to digest fats (bile acids). Specifically, sterol 27-hydroxylase breaks down cholesterol to form a bile acid called chenodeoxycholic acid. The formation of bile acids from cholesterol is the body's main pathway for cholesterol removal. Sterol 27-hydroxylase plays a key role in maintaining normal cholesterol levels in the body.","Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis At least 90 mutations that cause cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis have been identified in the CYP27A1 gene. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a disorder characterized by abnormal storage of fats (lipids) in many areas of the body. Most CYP27A1 gene mutations change one protein building block (amino acid) in the sterol 27-hydroxylase enzyme. The most common mutation changes the amino acid arginine to the amino acid cysteine at position 362 in the protein (written as Arg362Cys or R362C). Changes in amino acids typically disrupt the normal function of the protein and impair its ability to help form chenodeoxycholic acid. Other mutations cause no functional enzyme to be made. As a result, other molecules are formed by an alternative pathway. A molecule called cholestanol, which is similar to cholesterol, is produced and accumulates in blood and tissues. Cholesterol also accumulates in tissues, but levels in blood are typically normal. The accumulation of cholesterol and cholestanol throughout the body's tissues causes the signs and symptoms of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. "
CYP27B1 ,cytochrome P450 family 27 subfamily B member 1,"The CYP27B1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 1-alpha-hydroxylase (1α-hydroxylase). This enzyme carries out the second of two reactions to convert vitamin D to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, also known as calcitriol. Vitamin D can be acquired from foods in the diet or can be made in the body with the help of sunlight exposure. When active, this vitamin is involved in maintaining the proper balance of several minerals in the body, including calcium and phosphate, which are essential for the normal formation of bones and teeth. One of vitamin D's major roles is to control the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the intestines into the bloodstream. Vitamin D is also involved in several processes unrelated to bone and tooth formation.","Vitamin D-dependent rickets At least 70 mutations in the CYP27B1 gene have been found to cause vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1A (VDDR1A), also known as vitamin D 1α-hydroxylase deficiency. This disorder of bone development is characterized by low levels of calcium (hypocalcemia) and phosphate (hypophosphatemia) in the blood, which lead to soft, weak bones that are prone to fracture. A common feature of this condition is abnormally curved (bowed) legs.The CYP27B1 gene mutations that cause this condition reduce or eliminate the function of 1α-hydroxylase. As a result, vitamin D does not get converted to its active form and cannot control mineral absorption. The resulting reduction in calcium and phosphate absorption from the intestines into the blood means there is less of these minerals to be deposited in developing bones (bone mineralization), which leads to soft, weak bones and other features of VDDR1A. Hypocalcemia also causes muscle weakness and seizures in some affected individuals. "
