INDEX,INITIAL,GENE NAME,NORMAL FUNCTION,HEALTH CONDITIONS RELATED TO GENETIC CHANGE
1,AAAS ,aladin WD repeat nucleoporin,"The AAAS gene provides instructions for making a protein called ALADIN whose function is not well understood. Within cells, ALADIN is found in the nuclear envelope, the structure that surrounds the nucleus and separates it from the rest of the cell. Based on its location, ALADIN is thought to be involved in the movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus.","Triple A syndrome At least 49 mutations in the AAAS gene have been found to cause triple A syndrome. These mutations change the structure of ALADIN in different ways; however, almost all mutations prevent this protein from reaching its proper location in the nuclear envelope. The absence of ALADIN likely disrupts the movement of molecules across this membrane. Researchers suspect that DNA repair proteins may be unable to enter the nucleus if ALADIN is missing from the nuclear envelope. DNA damage that is not repaired can cause the cell to become unstable and lead to cell death. Although the nervous system is particularly vulnerable to DNA damage, it remains unknown exactly how mutations in the AAAS gene lead to the signs and symptoms of triple A syndrome. "
2,AASS ,aminoadipate-semialdehyde synthase,"The AASS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase. This enzyme is found in most tissues, with the highest amounts found in the liver. Aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase is involved in the breakdown of the amino acid lysine, a building block of most proteins. It is called a bifunctional enzyme because is performs two functions. One function, called lysine-ketoglutarate reductase, breaks down lysine to a molecule called saccharopine. The other function, called saccharopine dehydrogenase, breaks down saccharopine to a molecule called alpha-aminoadipate semialdehyde.","Hyperlysinemia At least five mutations in the AASS gene have been found to cause hyperlysinemia. Most of these mutations change single amino acids in aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase. These mutations are thought to decrease or eliminate enzyme activity, resulting in an inability to break down lysine. Lysine that is not broken down accumulates in the blood, but it typically causes no health problems.When mutations in the AASS gene impair the breakdown of saccharopine, this molecule builds up in blood and urine. This buildup is sometimes referred to as saccharopinuria, which is considered to be a variant of hyperlysinemia. It is unclear if saccharopinuria causes any symptoms. "
3,ABAT ,4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase,"The ABAT gene provides instructions for making the GABA-transaminase enzyme. This enzyme helps break down a brain chemical (neurotransmitter) called GABA when it is not needed. GABA normally helps slow down (inhibit) brain cell activity when necessary, to prevent the brain from being overloaded with too many signals. For this reason GABA is called an inhibitory neurotransmitter.","GABA-transaminase deficiency At least 10 mutations in the ABAT gene have been identified in people with GABA-transaminase deficiency, which is a brain disease (encephalopathy) that begins in infancy. Babies with this disorder have recurrent seizures (epilepsy), movement problems, and profoundly delayed development. They may grow more rapidly in length than usual (accelerated linear growth), even though they have feeding problems and may not gain weight as quickly as expected (failure to thrive). Individuals with this disorder usually do not survive past the first 2 years of life, but some live longer into childhood.The ABAT gene mutations that cause GABA-transaminase deficiency lead to a shortage (deficiency) of functional GABA-transaminase enzyme. As a result, GABA is not properly broken down, so this neurotransmitter and another molecule called beta-alanine accumulate abnormally in brain cells. This accumulation alters the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain, leading to the neurological problems characteristic of GABA-transaminase deficiency. Excess GABA also leads to abnormal release of a protein that is necessary for growth of the body's bones and tissues (growth hormone), resulting in the accelerated linear growth that sometimes occurs in this disorder. "
4,ABCA1 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 1,"The ABCA1 gene belongs to a group of genes called the ATP-binding cassette family, which provides instructions for making proteins that transport molecules across cell membranes. The ABCA1 protein is produced in many tissues, with high amounts found in the liver and in immune system cells called macrophages. This protein moves cholesterol and certain fats called phospholipids across the cell membrane to the outside of the cell. These substances are then picked up by a protein called apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), which is produced from the APOA1 gene. ApoA-I, cholesterol, and phospholipids combine to make high-density lipoprotein (HDL), often referred to as ""good cholesterol"" because high levels of this substance reduce the chances of developing heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. HDL is a molecule that carries cholesterol and phospholipids through the bloodstream from the body's tissues to the liver. Once in the liver, cholesterol and phospholipids are redistributed to other tissues or removed from the body. The process of removing excess cholesterol from cells is extremely important for balancing cholesterol levels and maintaining cardiovascular health.","Familial HDL deficiency Mutations in the ABCA1 gene can cause a condition called familial HDL deficiency. People with this condition have reduced levels of HDL in their blood and may experience early-onset cardiovascular disease, often before age 50. While one copy of the altered ABCA1 gene causes familial HDL deficiency, two copies of the altered gene cause a more severe related disorder called Tangier disease (described below).Most ABCA1 gene mutations that cause familial HDL deficiency change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ABCA1 protein. These mutations prevent the release of cholesterol and phospholipids from cells, decreasing the amount of these substances available to form HDL. As a result, the levels of HDL in the blood are low. A shortage (deficiency) of HDL is believed to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. "
5,ABCA3 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 3,"The ABCA3 gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in surfactant production. Surfactant is a mixture of certain fats (called phospholipids) and proteins that lines the lung tissue and makes breathing easy. Without normal surfactant, the tissue surrounding the air sacs in the lungs (the alveoli) sticks together after exhalation (because of a force called surface tension), causing the alveoli to collapse. As a result, filling the lungs with air on each breath becomes very difficult, and delivery of oxygen to the body is impaired.The ABCA3 protein is found in the membrane that surrounds lamellar bodies, which are the cellular structures in which the phospholipids and proteins that make up surfactant are packaged. The ABCA3 protein transports phospholipids into the lamellar bodies where they interact with surfactant proteins to form surfactant. The ABCA3 protein also appears to be involved in the formation of normal lamellar bodies. In addition to packaging, lamellar bodies are important for the correct processing of surfactant proteins, which is necessary for the proteins to mature and become functional.","Surfactant dysfunction More than 100 ABCA3 gene mutations that cause surfactant dysfunction have been identified. Surfactant dysfunction due to mutations in this gene (often called ABCA3 deficiency) can cause severe, often fatal breathing problems in newborns or gradual onset of milder breathing problems in children or adults.Some mutations in the ABCA3 gene lead to the production of a protein that is not inserted into the lamellar body membrane. Other mutations lead to the production of an abnormal protein that is found in the lamellar body membrane but has little or no function. Without ABCA3 protein function, the transport of surfactant phospholipids is decreased. In addition, lamellar body formation is impaired, which causes abnormal processing of surfactant proteins. ABCA3 gene mutations result in abnormal surfactant composition and function. The loss of functional surfactant raises surface tension in the alveoli, causing difficulty breathing and collapse of the lungs. It has been suggested that mutations that eliminate ABCA3 protein function cause severe forms of surfactant dysfunction, and mutations that leave some residual ABCA3 activity cause milder forms of the condition. "
6,ABCA4 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 4,"The ABCA4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in the retina, the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. Specifically, the ABCA4 protein is produced in the retina's light receptor cells (photoreceptors). The ABCA4 protein is active following phototransduction, the process by which light entering the eye is converted into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain. Phototransduction leads to the formation of potentially toxic substances that can damage photoreceptor cells. The ABCA4 protein removes one of these substances, called N-retinylidene-PE, from photoreceptor cells.","Cone-rod dystrophy More than 40 mutations in the ABCA4 gene have been found to cause a vision disorder called cone-rod dystrophy. The problems associated with this condition include a loss of visual sharpness (acuity), an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), and impaired color vision. These vision problems worsen over time. It is estimated that ABCA4 gene mutations account for 30 to 60 percent of cases of cone-rod dystrophy that are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.Most of the ABCA4 gene mutations that cause cone-rod dystrophy change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ABCA4 protein. The altered protein cannot remove N-retinylidene-PE from photoreceptor cells. As a result, N-retinylidene-PE combines with another substance to produce a molecule called N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine (A2E), which builds up in these cells. The buildup of A2E is toxic to photoreceptor cells and leads to their deterioration, causing progressive vision loss in people with cone-rod dystrophy. Cone-rod dystrophy caused by ABCA4 gene mutations tends to be associated with more severe vision problems than cone-rod dystrophy caused by other genetic mutations. "
7,ABCA12 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 12,"The ABCA12 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. ABC transporter proteins carry many types of molecules across cell membranes. In particular, the ABCA12 protein plays a major role in transporting fats (lipids) in cells that make up the outermost layer of skin (the epidermis). This lipid transport is needed to maintain the layers of lipids within the epidermis that are necessary to prevent water loss (dehydration) and for normal development of the skin. The ABCA12 protein is also found in several other tissues, including the testes, placenta, lungs, stomach, fetal brain, and liver.","Harlequin ichthyosis More than 65 mutations in the ABCA12 gene have been identified in people with harlequin ichthyosis. This skin condition is characterized by hard, thick scales that are present at birth; excessive dehydration; and increased risk of infections. Most of the mutations lead to an absence of ABCA12 protein or the production of an extremely small version of the protein that cannot transport lipids properly. A lack of lipid transport causes numerous problems with the development of the epidermis before and after birth. Specifically, it prevents the skin from forming an effective barrier against dehydration, and leads to the skin problems characteristic of harlequin ichthyosis. "
8,ABCB4 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 4,"The ABCB4 gene (also known as MDR3) provides instructions for making a protein that helps move certain fats called phospholipids across the membranes of liver cells and release the phospholipids into a digestive fluid called bile. Outside the liver cells, phospholipids attach (bind) to bile acids, which are a component of bile that digest fats. Large amounts of bile acids are potentially harmful to cells; when they are bound to phospholipids, bile acids are less toxic.","Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis More than 45 mutations in the ABCB4 gene have been found to cause a severe form of liver disease called progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3) that usually leads to liver failure. Affected individuals have a mutation in both copies of the ABCB4 gene. Mutations that lead to the production of a short, nonfunctional protein or cause no protein to be produced tend to be associated with more severe liver disease that appears earlier in life. ABCB4 gene mutations that cause PFIC3 impair the movement of phospholipids across cell membranes, leading to a lack of phospholipids available to bind to bile acids. A buildup of free bile acids damages liver cells, which causes the signs and symptoms of liver disease. "
9,ABCB7 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 7,"The ABCB7 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. ABC transporter proteins carry many types of molecules across membranes in cells.The ABCB7 protein is located in the inner membrane of cell structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria are involved in a wide variety of cellular activities, including energy production, chemical signaling, and regulation of cell growth and division. In the mitochondria of developing red blood cells (erythroblasts), the ABCB7 protein plays a critical role in the production of heme. Heme contains iron and is a component of hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in the blood.The ABCB7 protein is also involved in the formation of certain proteins containing clusters of iron and sulfur atoms (Fe-S clusters). Researchers suspect that the ABCB7 protein transports Fe-S clusters from mitochondria, where they are formed, to the surrounding cellular fluid (cytosol), where they can be incorporated into proteins. Overall, researchers believe that the ABCB7 protein helps maintain an appropriate balance of iron (iron homeostasis) in developing red blood cells.","X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia At least three mutations in the ABCB7 gene have been identified in people with X-linked sideroblastic anemia with ataxia. Each of these mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the ABCB7 protein, slightly altering its structure. These changes disrupt the protein's usual role in heme production and iron homeostasis. Anemia results when heme cannot be produced normally, and therefore not enough hemoglobin is made. It is unclear how changes in the ABCB7 gene lead to problems with coordination and balance (ataxia) and other movement abnormalities. "
10,ABCB11 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 11,"The ABCB11 gene provides instructions for making a protein called the bile salt export pump (BSEP), which is found in the liver. Bile salts are a component of bile, which is used to digest fats. Bile salts are produced by liver cells and then transported out of the cell by BSEP to make bile. The release of bile salts from liver cells is critical for the normal secretion of bile.","Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis Mutations in the ABCB11 gene can cause benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 (BRIC2). People with BRIC2 have occasional episodes of impaired bile secretion that lead to severe itching (pruritus) and yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). On occasion, people with BRIC2 have later been diagnosed with a more severe condition called progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 (described below) when their symptoms worsened.Affected individuals have a mutation in both copies of the ABCB11 gene. Mutations in the ABCB11 gene that cause BRIC2 lead to a 40 to 50 percent reduction of bile salt transport. The resulting buildup of bile salts in the liver leads to the signs and symptoms of BRIC2. It is unclear what causes the episodes to begin or end. "
11,ABCC2 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 2,"The ABCC2 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2). This protein is one of a family of multidrug resistance proteins involved in the transport of substances out of cells. For example, MRP2 clears certain drugs from organs and tissues, playing a part in drug metabolism. Drug metabolism involves the breakdown of drugs into different chemical components allowing the drugs to have their intended effects and eventually be eliminated from the body. MRP2 also transports a substance called bilirubin out of liver cells and into bile (a digestive fluid produced by the liver). Bilirubin is produced during the breakdown of old red blood cells and has an orange-yellow tint.MRP2 is primarily found within the outer membrane that surrounds cells in the liver, with smaller amounts in the kidneys, intestine, and placenta.","Dubin-Johnson syndrome More than 40 mutations in the ABCC2 gene have been found to cause Dubin-Johnson syndrome. This condition is characterized by jaundice, which is a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, that typically appears during adolescence or early adulthood. Most of the mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in MRP2. A common mutation in Iranian Jews living in Israel who have Dubin-Johnson syndrome replaces the amino acid isoleucine with the amino acid phenylalanine at position 1173 in MRP2 (written as Ile1173Phe or I1173F). Another mutation that is seen more frequently in those affected in Israel's Moroccan-Jewish population replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid histidine at position 1150 in MRP2 (written as Arg1150His or R1150H).ABCC2 gene mutations that cause Dubin-Johnson syndrome have a variety of effects on the structure and function of MRP2. Mutations may alter how the protein is made, impair transport of the protein to the cell surface, or cause the protein to be broken down too quickly. All of these mutations result in a decrease or absence of MRP2 activity at the cell membrane. As a result, the body's ability to release (excrete) bilirubin is impaired. A buildup of bilirubin causes jaundice in people with Dubin-Johnson syndrome. The accumulation of other substances that usually get transported out of tissues by the MRP2 protein can cause additional signs and symptoms in people with Dubin-Johnson syndrome, but these features usually do not cause health problems. "
12,ABCC6 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 6,"The ABCC6 gene provides instructions for making a protein called multidrug resistance-associated protein 6 (MRP6, also known as the ABCC6 protein). This protein is found primarily in the liver and kidneys, with small amounts in other tissues such as the skin, stomach, blood vessels, and eyes. The MRP6 protein belongs to a group of proteins that transport molecules across cell membranes; however, little is known about the substances transported by MRP6.Some studies suggest that MRP6 stimulates the release of a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from cells through an unknown mechanism. This ATP is quickly broken down into other molecules called adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate. Pyrophosphate helps control deposition of calcium (calcification) and other minerals (mineralization) in the body.Other studies suggest that MRP6 transports a substance that is involved in the breakdown of ATP. This unidentified substance is thought to help prevent mineralization of tissues.","Generalized arterial calcification of infancy At least 13 mutations in the ABCC6 gene have been identified in individuals with generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI), a life-threatening disorder characterized by abnormal calcification in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the arteries). Most of these mutations have also been identified in people with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), described below. These mutations lead to an absent or nonfunctional MRP6 protein. It is unclear how a lack of properly functioning MRP6 protein leads to GACI. This shortage may impair the release of ATP from cells. As a result, little pyrophosphate is produced and calcium accumulates in the blood vessels and other tissues affected by GACI. Alternatively, a lack of functioning MRP6 may impair the transport of a substance that would normally prevent mineralization, leading to the abnormal accumulation of calcium characteristic of GACI. It is not known why the same mutations can cause GACI in some individuals and PXE in others. "
13,ABCC8 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 8,"The ABCC8 gene provides instructions for making the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) protein. The SUR1 protein is one part (subunit) of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channel that is found across cell membranes in the beta cells of the pancreas. Beta cells secrete insulin, which is a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels. Insulin controls how much sugar (in the form of glucose) is passed from the bloodstream into cells to be used as energy. The K-ATP channel controls the secretion of insulin out of beta cells and into the bloodstream. These channels open and close in response to the amount of glucose in the bloodstream, which helps regulate insulin secretion and control blood sugar levels. The closing of the channels results in a process that triggers insulin secretion by beta cells.","Congenital hyperinsulinism More than 300 mutations in the ABCC8 gene have been found to cause congenital hyperinsulinism. This condition causes frequent episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), decreased energy, and irritability. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SUR1 protein.Some ABCC8 mutations prevent the SUR1 protein from reaching the cell membrane, interfering with the proper formation of the K-ATP channel. Other mutations interfere with the K-ATP channel's function or its responses to outside molecules. Defective K-ATP channels lead to the constant release of insulin from beta cells. As a result, glucose is rapidly removed from the bloodstream. Without treatment, the hypoglycemia caused by congenital hyperinsulinism may result in serious complications such as intellectual disability and seizures. "
14,ABCC9 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 9,"The ABCC9 gene provides instructions for making the sulfonylurea receptor 2 (SUR2) protein. This protein forms one part (subunit) of a channel that transports charged atoms of potassium (potassium ions) across cell membranes. Each of these channels consists of eight subunits: four SUR2 proteins and four proteins produced from either the KCNJ8 or KCNJ11 gene. The SUR2 subunits regulate the activity of the channel, determining whether it is open or closed.Channels made with the SUR2 protein are known as ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channels. The channels open and close in response to the amount of ATP, the cell's main energy source, inside the cell. The resulting transport of potassium ions is part of a complex network of signals that relay chemical messages into and out of cells.Although K-ATP channels are present in cells and tissues throughout the body, the highest levels of SUR2-containing channels are found in skeletal and heart (cardiac) muscle. These channels indirectly help regulate the concentration of calcium ions in cells. This regulation is essential for normal heart function. The function of these channels in other tissues is unclear.","Cantú syndrome At least 14 mutations in the ABCC9 gene have been found to cause Cantú syndrome, a rare condition characterized by excess hair growth (hypertrichosis), a distinctive facial appearance, and heart defects. Each of the mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the SUR2 protein. These changes likely alter the structure of the protein and its ability to regulate the activity of K-ATP channels. Studies suggest that the abnormal channels are open when they should be closed. However, it is unknown how this problem with potassium channel function leads to excess hair growth, heart defects, and the other features of Cantú syndrome. "
15,ABCD1 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily D member 1,"The ABCD1 gene provides instructions for producing the adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP). ALDP is located in the membranes of cell structures called peroxisomes. Peroxisomes are small sacs within cells that process many types of molecules. ALDP brings a group of fats called very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) into peroxisomes, where they are broken down.","X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy More than 650 mutations in the ABCD1 gene have been found to cause X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. This condition is characterized by varying degrees of cognitive and movement problems as well as hormone imbalances. The mutations that cause X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy prevent the production of any ALDP in about 75 percent of people with this disorder. Other people with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy can produce ALDP, but the protein is not able to perform its normal function. With little or no functional ALDP, VLCFAs are not broken down, and they build up in the body. The accumulation of these fats may be toxic to the adrenal glands (small glands on top of each kidney) and to the fatty layer of insulation (myelin) that surrounds many nerves in the body. Research suggests that the accumulation of VLCFAs triggers an inflammatory response in the brain, which could lead to the breakdown of myelin. The destruction of these tissues leads to the signs and symptoms of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. "
16,ABCD4 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily D member 4,"The ABCD4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the conversion of vitamin B12 (also known as cobalamin) into one of two molecules, adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) or methylcobalamin (MeCbl). AdoCbl is required for the normal function of an enzyme known as methylmalonyl CoA mutase. This enzyme helps break down certain protein building blocks (amino acids), fats (lipids), and cholesterol. AdoCbl is called a cofactor because it helps methylmalonyl CoA mutase carry out its function. MeCbl is also a cofactor, but for an enzyme known as methionine synthase. This enzyme converts the amino acid homocysteine to another amino acid, methionine. The body uses methionine to make proteins and other important compounds.The ABCD4 protein is found in the membrane that surrounds cell structures called lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments within cells in which enzymes digest and recycle materials. In the lysosomal membrane, the ABCD4 protein interacts with another protein called LMBD1 (produced from the LMBRD1 gene). Together, these two proteins transport vitamin B12 out of lysosomes, making it available for further processing into AdoCbl and MeCbl.","Methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria At least five mutations in the ABCD4 gene have been found to cause methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria, cblJ type, one form of a disorder that causes developmental delay, eye defects, neurological problems, and blood abnormalities. ABCD4 gene mutations involved in this condition lead to production of an abnormal ABCD4 protein that is unable to function. A shortage of functional ABCD4 protein prevents the release of vitamin B12 from lysosomes, so the vitamin is unavailable for the production of AdoCbl and MeCbl. Because both of these cofactors are missing, the enzymes that require them (methylmalonyl CoA mutase and methionine synthase) do not function normally. As a result, certain amino acids, lipids, and cholesterol are not broken down and homocysteine cannot be converted to methionine. This dual defect results in a buildup of toxic compounds as well as homocysteine, and a decrease in the production of methionine within the body. This combination of imbalances leads to the signs and symptoms of methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria. "
17,ABCG2 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (Junior blood group),"The ABCG2 gene belongs to a group of genes called the ATP-binding cassette family; genes in this family provide instructions for making proteins that transport molecules across cell membranes. In the intestines, the ABCG2 protein helps release (secrete) a substance called urate into the urine. Urate is a byproduct of certain normal biochemical reactions in the body. In the bloodstream it acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from the damaging effects of unstable molecules called free radicals. Urate levels are regulated by the kidneys and, to a lesser extent, by the intestines.The ABCG2 protein also transports certain drugs out of cells. For example, this protein clears some chemotherapy drugs from organs and tissues. Transport of these drugs allows them to have their intended effects and be eliminated from the body.","Gout Genetic changes in the ABCG2 gene have been found to be associated with a condition called gout, which is a form of arthritis that causes painful join inflammation.ABCG2 gene changes associated with gout decrease the protein's ability to release urate. One variant replaces the protein building block (amino acid) glutamine with the amino acid lysine at position 141 in the protein (written as Gln141Lys or Q141K). This change reduces the protein's ability to secrete urate by half. Another variant creates a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the ABCG2 protein (written as Gln126Ter or Q126X), which results in no functional ABCG2 protein. Variants in the ABCG2 gene reduce the removal of urate in the blood, which causes the blood level of urate to rise. The excess urate can accumulate in the body's joints in the form of crystals, triggering an inflammatory response from the immune system and leading to gout.While changes in the ABCG2 gene can alter urate levels in the body, they are not enough to cause gout by themselves. A combination of dietary, genetic, and other environmental factors play a part in determining the risk of developing this complex disorder. "
18,ABCG5 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 5,"The ABCG5 gene provides instructions for making sterolin-1, which makes up half of a protein called sterolin. The other half of the sterolin protein, sterolin-2, is produced from a gene called ABCG8. Sterolin is involved in eliminating plant sterols, which are fatty components of plant-based foods that cannot be used by human cells.Sterolin is a transporter protein, which is a type of protein that moves substances across cell membranes. It is found mostly in cells of the intestines and liver and transports plant sterols. After plant sterols are absorbed from food into intestinal cells, the sterolin transporters in these cells pump them back into the intestinal tract. Sterolin transporters in liver cells pump the plant sterols into a fluid called bile that is released into the intestine. From the intestine, the plant sterols are eliminated with the feces. This process removes most of the dietary plant sterols, and allows only about 5 percent of these substances to get into the bloodstream. Sterolin also helps regulate levels of cholesterol, another fatty substance found in animal products, in a similar fashion; normally about 50 percent of cholesterol in the diet is absorbed by the body.","Sitosterolemia At least 24 ABCG5 gene mutations have been identified in people with sitosterolemia, which is a condition caused by accumulation of plant sterols. The mutations result in a defective sterolin transporter and impair the elimination of plant sterols and, to a lesser degree, cholesterol from the body. These fatty substances build up in the arteries, skin, and other tissues, resulting in clogged blood vessels that can impair blood flow (atherosclerosis), fatty skin growths (xanthomas), and the additional signs and symptoms of sitosterolemia. Excess plant sterols in red blood cells likely make their cell membranes stiff and prone to rupture, leading to a reduced number of red blood cells (anemia). Changes in the lipid composition of the membranes of red blood cells and platelets may account for the other blood abnormalities that sometimes occur in sitosterolemia. "
19,ABCG8 ,ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 8,"The ABCG8 gene provides instructions for making sterolin-2, which makes up half of a protein called sterolin.

Changes in the lipid composition of the membranes of red blood cells and platelets may account for the other blood abnormalities that sometimes occur in sitosterolemia. "
20,ABHD5 ,abhydrolase domain containing 5,"The ABHD5 gene provides instructions for making a protein that turns on (activates) an enzyme called adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). The ATGL enzyme plays a role in breaking down fats called triglycerides, which are the main source of stored energy in cells. Triglycerides are the major component of cell structures called lipid droplets (also called adiposomes). The ABHD5 protein and the ATGL enzyme are found on the surface of lipid droplets. Once activated, the ATGL enzyme breaks down triglycerides in these structures to provide energy for the body.","Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome At least 20 mutations in the ABHD5 gene have been found to cause Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome. These mutations impair the ABHD5 protein's ability to activate the ATGL enzyme. Without an active ATGL enzyme, triglycerides within lipid droplets cannot be broken down. As a result, these fats accumulate in various organs and tissues throughout the body, causing the signs and symptoms of Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome. "
21,ABL1 ,"ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase","The ABL1 gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in many processes in cells throughout the body. The ABL1 protein functions as a kinase, which is an enzyme that changes the activity of other proteins by adding a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) at specific positions. The ABL1 kinase is normally turned off (inactive) and must be turned on (activated) to perform its functions.The ABL1 kinase can be turned on by a number of different triggers and can add a phosphate group to many different proteins (also called substrates). This diversity allows ABL1 to be involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, including cell growth and division (proliferation), maturation (differentiation), and movement (migration). It can either aid in cell survival or trigger controlled cell death (apoptosis), depending on cellular conditions. The ABL1 kinase interacts with several proteins involved in the network of fibers called the actin cytoskeleton, which makes up the structural framework inside cells. These interactions help control cell migration and the attachment of cells to one another (adhesion), among many other processes. ABL1 can also help regulate the activity of other genes.The ABL1 gene belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous.","Chronic myeloid leukemia A genetic rearrangement (translocation) involving the ABL1 gene causes a type of cancer of blood-forming cells called chronic myeloid leukemia. This slow-growing cancer leads to an overproduction of abnormal white blood cells. Common features of the condition include excessive tiredness (fatigue), fever, weight loss, and an enlarged spleen.The translocation involved in this condition, written as t(9;22), fuses part of the ABL1 gene from chromosome 9 with part of the BCR gene from chromosome 22, creating an abnormal fusion gene called BCR-ABL1. The abnormal chromosome 22, containing a piece of chromosome 9 and the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, is commonly called the Philadelphia chromosome. The translocation is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in the abnormal blood cells. This type of genetic change, called a somatic mutation, is not inherited.The protein produced from the abnormal fusion gene, called BCR-ABL1, functions as a kinase. However, unlike the ABL1 kinase, it does not require signals in the cell to turn it on. The constantly active BCR-ABL1 protein signals cells to continue dividing abnormally and prevents them from self-destructing, which leads to overproduction of the abnormal cells.The presence of the Philadelphia chromosome provides a target for molecular therapies. "
22,ACAD8 ,acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family member 8,"The ACAD8 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IBD). This enzyme is found in mitochondria, the energy-producing centers inside cells. The IBD enzyme is involved in breaking down proteins from food. Specifically, this enzyme is responsible for the third step in the breakdown of a protein building block (amino acid) called valine. The IBD enzyme converts a molecule called isobutyryl-CoA into a molecule called methylacrylyl-CoA. Other enzymes further break down methylacrylyl-CoA into molecules that cells can use for energy.","Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency At least 19 mutations in the ACAD8 gene have been found to cause isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IBD) deficiency. Some of these mutations reduce the activity of the IBD enzyme, while other mutations prevent the gene from producing any functional enzyme. As a result, valine is not broken down properly. An inability to process valine may lead to reduced energy production and the features of IBD deficiency. "
23,ACAD9 ,acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family member 9,"The ACAD9 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found in mitochondria, the energy-producing structures inside cells. The ACAD9 enzyme is critical in helping assemble a group of proteins known as complex I. Complex I is one of several complexes that carry out a multistep process called oxidative phosphorylation, through which cells derive much of their energy.The ACAD9 enzyme also plays a role in fatty acid oxidation, a multistep process that occurs within mitochondria to break down (metabolize) fats and convert them into energy. The ACAD9 enzyme helps metabolize two fats called palmitate and oleate, which belong to a certain group of fats called long-chain fatty acids. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods without food (fasting), fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.","ACAD9 deficiency At least 30 ACAD9 gene mutations have been found to cause ACAD9 deficiency. This condition varies in severity and can cause muscle weakness (myopathy), heart problems, intellectual disability, and other signs and symptoms. Most ACAD9 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ACAD9 enzyme. Some mutations disrupt only complex I assembly. Decreased complex I formation can impair oxidative phosphorylation and reduce the amount of energy available in the cell. Other mutations affect the ACAD9 enzyme's structure or stability and likely disrupt both complex I assembly and long-chain fatty acid oxidation. A reduction in both of these energy production processes tends to be associated with the most severe signs and symptoms of ACAD9 deficiency.Although the exact mechanism that causes the signs and symptoms of ACAD9 deficiency is unclear, it is likely that cells that are less able to produce energy die off, particularly cells in the brain, skeletal muscle, and other tissues and organs that require a lot of energy. The loss of cells in these tissues is thought to lead to myopathy and other features of ACAD9 deficiency. "
24,ACADM ,acyl-CoA dehydrogenase medium chain,"The ACADM gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD). This enzyme functions within mitochondria, the energy-producing centers in cells. MCAD is essential for fatty acid oxidation, which is the multistep process that breaks down (metabolizes) fats and converts them to energy.MCAD is required to metabolize a group of fats called medium-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids are found in foods and body fat and are produced when larger fatty acids are metabolized. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods without food (fasting), fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.","Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency More than 80 mutations in the ACADM gene have been found to cause medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency. Many of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the MCAD enzyme. The most common change replaces the amino acid lysine with the amino acid glutamic acid at position 304 in the enzyme (written as Lys304Glu or K304E). This mutation and other amino acid substitutions alter the enzyme's structure, severely reducing or eliminating its activity. Other types of mutations lead to an abnormally small and unstable enzyme that cannot function.With a shortage (deficiency) of functional MCAD enzyme, medium-chain fatty acids are not metabolized properly. As a result, these fats are not converted to energy, which can lead to some features of this disorder such as lack of energy (lethargy) and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Medium-chain fatty acids or partially metabolized fatty acids may build up in tissues and damage the liver and brain. This abnormal buildup causes the other signs and symptoms of MCAD deficiency. "
25,ACADS ,acyl-CoA dehydrogenase short chain,"The ACADS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD). This enzyme functions within mitochondria, the energy-producing centers within cells. SCAD is essential for fatty acid oxidation, which is the multistep process that breaks down (metabolizes) fats and converts them to energy.SCAD is required to metabolize a group of fats called short-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids are found in some foods and are also produced when larger fatty acids are metabolized. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods without food (fasting), fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.","Short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency More than 55 mutations in the ACADS gene have been found to cause short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency. Almost all of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SCAD enzyme. These mutations prevent the enzyme from properly metabolizing short-chain fatty acids. As a result, these fats are not converted into energy, which can lead to the characteristic signs and symptoms of this disorder, including lack of energy (lethargy), low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), poor muscle tone (hypotonia), and weakness.Researchers have also identified two common variations (polymorphisms) in the ACADS gene that each change one amino acid in the SCAD enzyme. Unlike other changes in the ACADS gene, these polymorphisms do not cause SCAD deficiency but may increase a person's risk of developing this disorder. One of these polymorphisms replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid tryptophan at protein position 147 (written as Arg147Trp or R147W). The other polymorphism switches the amino acid glycine with the amino acid serine at protein position 185 (written as Gly185Ser or G185S). Other genetic and environmental factors likely influence the risk of developing SCAD deficiency when a person carries either of these polymorphisms. "
26,ACADSB ,acyl-CoA dehydrogenase short/branched chain,"The ACADSB gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called short/branched chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SBCAD, also known as 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase), which plays an important role in processing proteins. Normally, the body breaks down proteins from food into smaller parts called amino acids. Amino acids can be further processed to provide energy for the body. In cells throughout the body, SBCAD is found within specialized structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria convert energy from food into a form that cells can use.The SBCAD enzyme helps break down a particular amino acid called isoleucine. Specifically, this enzyme helps with the third step of the process, performing a chemical reaction that converts a molecule called 2-methylbutyryl-CoA to another molecule, tiglyl-CoA. Additional chemical reactions convert tiglyl-CoA into molecules that are used for energy. Through similar chemical reactions, the SBCAD enzyme also aids in the breakdown of other amino acids.","Short/branched chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency Researchers have identified more than 10 ACADSB gene mutations in people with short/branched chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SBCAD) deficiency. While most people with this condition have no related health problems, some have reduced energy (lethargy), muscle weakness, seizures, developmental delays, or other health problems.Many of the ACADSB gene mutations replace one of the amino acids in the SBCAD enzyme with an incorrect amino acid. Other mutations lead to an abnormally small version of this enzyme that is missing several amino acids. As a result of these mutations, SBCAD has little or no activity. With a shortage (deficiency) of normal enzyme activity, the body is unable to break down isoleucine properly. Researchers speculate that some features of this disorder, such as lethargy and muscle weakness, occur because isoleucine is not converted to energy. In addition, impairment of SBCAD may allow the buildup of toxic compounds, which can lead to serious health problems. "
27,ACADVL ,acyl-CoA dehydrogenase very long chain,"The ACADVL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD). This enzyme functions within mitochondria, the energy-producing centers in cells. Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is essential for fatty acid oxidation, which is the multistep process that breaks down (metabolizes) fats and converts them to energy.Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is required to metabolize a group of fats called very long-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids are found in food and body fat. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods without food (fasting), fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.","Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency More than 100 mutations in the ACADVL gene have been found to cause very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency. Many of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the VLCAD enzyme. Other mutations delete part of the ACADVL gene or create a premature stop signal in the instructions for making VLCAD. These mutations lead to a change in the enzyme's structure, severely reducing or eliminating its activity. As a result, very little functional enzyme is produced.With a shortage (deficiency) of functional VLCAD enzyme, very-long chain fatty acids are not metabolized properly. As a result, these fats are not converted to energy, which can lead to signs and symptoms of this disorder such as the lack of energy (lethargy) and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Very long-chain fatty acids or partially metabolized fatty acids may build up in tissues and damage the heart, liver, and muscles. This abnormal buildup causes the other signs and symptoms of VLCAD deficiency. "
28,ACAN ,aggrecan,"The ACAN gene provides instructions for making the aggrecan protein. Aggrecan is a type of protein known as a proteoglycan, which means it has several sugar molecules attached to it. It is the most abundant proteoglycan in cartilage, a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone (a process called ossification), except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose, airways, and external ears.Aggrecan attaches to the other components of cartilage, organizing the network of molecules that gives cartilage its strength. These interactions occur at a specific region of the aggrecan protein called the C-type lectin domain (CLD). Because of the attached sugars, aggrecan attracts water molecules and gives cartilage its gel-like structure. This feature enables the cartilage to resist compression, protecting bones and joints. Although its role is unclear, aggrecan affects bone development.","Familial osteochondritis dissecans At least one mutation in the ACAN gene has been found to cause familial osteochondritis dissecans. This condition is characterized by areas of bone damage (lesions) caused by the detachment of cartilage and some of the underlying bone from the end of the bone at a joint. People with familial osteochondritis dissecans have multiple lesions that affect the knees, elbows, hips, or ankles. Other common features are short stature and early development of a painful joint disorder called osteoarthritis.The ACAN gene mutation associated with this condition changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the CLD of the aggrecan protein. Specifically, the amino acid valine is replaced by the amino acid methionine at protein position 2303 (written as Val2303Met or V2303M). The abnormal aggrecan protein is unable to attach to other components of cartilage. As a result, the cartilage is disorganized and weak. It is unclear how the abnormal cartilage is involved in the development of the lesions and osteoarthritis characteristic of familial osteochondritis dissecans. Researchers have suggested that a disorganized cartilage network in growing bones impairs their growth, leading to short stature. "
29,ACAT1 ,acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1,"The ACAT1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found in the energy-producing centers within cells (mitochondria). This enzyme plays an essential role in breaking down proteins and fats from the diet. Specifically, it helps process isoleucine, an amino acid that is a building block of many proteins. This enzyme is also involved in processing ketones, which are molecules that are produced when fats are broken down in the body.During the breakdown of proteins, the ACAT1 enzyme is responsible for the last step in processing isoleucine. It converts a molecule called 2-methyl-acetoacetyl-CoA into two smaller molecules, propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, that can be used to produce energy.The ACAT1 enzyme carries out the last step in ketone breakdown (ketolysis) during the processing of fats. The enzyme converts a molecule called acetoacetyl-CoA into two molecules of acetyl-CoA, which can be used to produce energy. In the liver, the enzyme also carries out this chemical reaction in reverse, which is the first step in building new ketones (ketogenesis).","Beta-ketothiolase deficiency More than 40 mutations in the ACAT1 gene have been identified in people with beta-ketothiolase deficiency. Some of these genetic changes disrupt the normal function of the enzyme, while other mutations prevent cells from producing any functional enzyme.A shortage of the ACAT1 enzyme prevents the body from processing proteins and fats properly. As a result, chemical byproducts called organic acids can build up to toxic levels in the blood. These substances cause the blood to become too acidic (ketoacidosis), which can damage the body's tissues and organs, particularly in the nervous system. This damage leads to episodes of vomiting, dehydration, and other health problems associated with beta-ketothiolase deficiency. "
30,ACE ,angiotensin I converting enzyme,"The ACE gene provides instructions for making the angiotensin-converting enzyme. This enzyme is able to cut (cleave) proteins. It is part of the renin-angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure and the balance of fluids and salts in the body. By cutting a protein called angiotensin I at a particular location, the angiotensin-converting enzyme converts this protein to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to narrow (constrict), which results in increased blood pressure. This protein also stimulates production of the hormone aldosterone, which triggers the absorption of salt and water by the kidneys. The increased amount of fluid in the body also increases blood pressure. Proper blood pressure during fetal growth, which delivers oxygen to the developing tissues, is required for normal development of the kidneys, particularly of structures called the proximal tubules, and other tissues. In addition, angiotensin II may play a more direct role in kidney development, perhaps by affecting growth factors involved in the development of kidney structures.The angiotensin-converting enzyme can cleave other proteins, including bradykinin. Bradykinin causes blood vessels to widen (dilate), which decreases blood pressure. Cleavage by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inactivates bradykinin, helping to increase blood pressure.","Renal tubular dysgenesis Mutations in the ACE gene are the most common cause of a severe kidney disorder called renal tubular dysgenesis; at least 33 ACE gene mutations have been found in people with this disorder. Renal tubular dysgenesis is characterized by abnormal kidney development before birth, the inability to produce urine (anuria), and severe low blood pressure (hypotension). These problems result in a reduction of amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios), which leads to a set of birth defects known as the Potter sequence.Renal tubular dysgenesis can be caused by mutations in both copies of any of the genes involved in the renin-angiotensin system. The ACE gene mutations that cause this disorder prevent the production of functional angiotensin-converting enzyme, which impairs the formation of angiotensin II and results in a nonfunctional renin-angiotensin system. Without this system, the kidneys cannot control blood pressure. Because of low blood pressure, the flow of blood is reduced (hypoperfusion), and the body does not get enough oxygen during fetal development. As a result, kidney development is impaired, leading to the features of renal tubular dysgenesis. "
31,ACOX1 ,acyl-CoA oxidase 1,"The ACOX1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called peroxisomal straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase. This enzyme is found in sac-like cell structures (organelles) called peroxisomes, which contain a variety of enzymes that break down many different substances. The peroxisomal straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase enzyme plays a role in the breakdown of certain fat molecules called very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). Specifically, it is involved in the first step of a process called the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. This process shortens the VLCFA molecules by two carbon atoms at a time until the VLCFAs are converted to a molecule called acetyl-CoA, which is transported out of the peroxisomes for reuse by the cell.","Peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency More than 20 ACOX1 gene mutations have been identified in people with peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency. These mutations prevent the peroxisomal straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase enzyme from breaking down VLCFAs efficiently. As a result, these fatty acids accumulate in the body. It is unclear exactly how VLCFA accumulation leads to the specific features of peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency. However, researchers suggest that the abnormal fatty acid accumulation triggers inflammation in the nervous system that leads to the breakdown of myelin, which is the covering that protects nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. Destruction of myelin leads to a loss of myelin-containing tissue (white matter) in the brain and spinal cord; loss of white matter is described as leukodystrophy. Leukodystrophy is likely involved in the development of the neurological abnormalities that occur in peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency. "
32,ACP5 ,"acid phosphatase 5, tartrate resistant","The ACP5 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase type 5 (TRAP). The TRAP enzyme primarily regulates the activity of a protein called osteopontin, which is produced in bone cells called osteoclasts and in immune cells. Osteopontin performs a variety of functions in these cells. Two versions (isoforms) of the TRAP enzyme are produced: TRAP5a is found primarily in immune cells and TRAP5b is found primarily in bone cells called osteoclasts.Osteoclasts are specialized cells that break down and remove (resorb) bone tissue that is no longer needed. These cells are involved in bone remodeling, which is a normal process that replaces old bone tissue with new bone. During bone remodeling, osteopontin is turned on (activated), allowing osteoclasts to attach (bind) to bones. When the breakdown of bone is complete, TRAP5b turns off (inactivates) osteopontin, causing the osteoclasts to release themselves from bone.In the immune system, osteopontin is found primarily in cells called macrophages and dendritic cells. The protein helps fight infection by promoting inflammation, regulating immune cell activity, and turning on various immune system cells that are necessary to fight off foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. Like TRAP5b in bone cells, the TRAP5a enzyme inactivates osteopontin in macrophages and dendritic cells when it is no longer needed.","Spondyloenchondrodysplasia with immune dysregulation At least 10 mutations in the ACP5 gene have been found to cause spondyloenchondrodysplasia with immune dysregulation (SPENCDI). This condition is characterized by abnormalities in bone growth and immune system function. The ACP5 gene mutations that cause SPENCDI typically change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the TRAP enzyme or result in the production of an abnormally short enzyme. These mutations affect both TRAP isoforms and impair or eliminate TRAP's ability to inactivate osteopontin. As a result, osteopontin is abnormally active, prolonging bone breakdown by osteoclasts and triggering abnormal inflammation and immune responses by immune cells.In people with SPENCDI, increased bone breakdown contributes to the skeletal abnormalities, including irregularly shaped bones and short stature. An overactive immune system leads to increased susceptibility to autoimmune disorders, which occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. Immune system abnormalities also impair the body's normal response to harmful invaders, resulting in frequent infections. SPENCDI has several additional features, including movement disorders and intellectual disability, but it is unknown how changes in TRAP enzyme function lead to these other signs and symptoms. "
33,ACSF3 ,acyl-CoA synthetase family member 3,"The ACSF3 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme involved in the formation (synthesis) of fatty acids, which are building blocks used to make fats (lipids). The ACSF3 enzyme performs a chemical reaction that converts malonic acid to malonyl-CoA, which is the first step of fatty acid synthesis. Based on this activity, the enzyme is classified as a malonyl-CoA synthetase. The ACSF3 enzyme also converts methylmalonic acid to methylmalonyl-CoA, making it a methylmalonyl-CoA synthetase as well.Fatty acid synthesis occurs through two pathways, one of which takes place in cellular structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use, and fatty acid synthesis in these structures is thought to be important for their proper functioning. The ACSF3 enzyme is found only in mitochondria and is involved in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis.","Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria About a dozen mutations in the ACSF3 gene have been found in people with combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA), a condition characterized by elevated levels of chemicals known as malonic acid and methylmalonic acid in the body. This condition can cause development and growth problems beginning in childhood or neurological problems beginning in adulthood.Most ACSF3 gene mutations involved in CMAMMA change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ACSF3 enzyme. The altered enzyme likely has little or no function. Because the enzyme cannot convert malonic and methylmalonic acids, they build up in the body. Damage to organs and tissues caused by accumulation of malonic and methylmalonic acids may be responsible for the signs and symptoms of CMAMMA, although the mechanisms are unclear. "
34,ACTA1 ,"actin, alpha 1, skeletal muscle","The ACTA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called skeletal alpha (α)-actin, which is part of the actin protein family. Actin proteins are important for cell movement and the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction). These proteins also help maintain the cytoskeleton, which is the structural framework that determines cell shape and organizes cell contents.Skeletal α-actin plays an important role in skeletal muscles, which are muscles that the body uses for movement. Within skeletal muscle cells, skeletal α-actin is an essential component of structures called sarcomeres. Sarcomeres are composed of thin filaments made up of actin and thick filaments made up of another protein called myosin. Attachment (binding) and release of the overlapping thick and thin filaments allows them to move relative to each other so that the muscles can contract.","Actin-accumulation myopathy At least nine mutations in the ACTA1 gene have been identified in people with actin-accumulation myopathy. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the skeletal α-actin protein sequence.Researchers suggest that ACTA1 gene mutations that cause actin-accumulation myopathy may affect the way the actin binds to ATP. ATP is a molecule that supplies energy for cells' activities and is important in the formation of thin filaments from individual actin molecules. Dysfunctional actin-ATP binding may result in abnormal thin filament formation and impair muscle contraction, leading to muscle weakness and the other signs and symptoms of actin-accumulation myopathy. "
35,ACTA2 ,"actin, alpha 2, smooth muscle, aorta","The ACTA2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called smooth muscle alpha (α)-2 actin, which is part of the actin protein family. Actin proteins are important for cell movement and the tensing (contraction) of muscles.Smooth muscle α-2 actin is found in smooth muscle cells. Smooth muscles line the internal organs, including the blood vessels, stomach, and intestines. Within smooth muscle cells, smooth muscle α-2 actin forms the core of structures called sarcomeres, which are necessary for muscles to contract. Smooth muscles contract and relax as part of their normal function without being consciously controlled.Layers of smooth muscle cells are found in the walls of the arteries, which are blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Smooth muscle α-2 actin contributes to the ability of these muscles to contract, which allows the arteries to maintain their shape instead of stretching out as blood is pumped through them.","Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection More than 30 ACTA2 gene mutations have been identified in people with familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (familial TAAD). This disorder involves problems with the aorta, which is the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body. The aorta can weaken and stretch, causing a bulge in the blood vessel wall (an aneurysm). Stretching of the aorta may also lead to a sudden tearing of the layers in the aorta wall (aortic dissection). Aortic aneurysm and dissection can cause life-threatening internal bleeding.ACTA2 gene mutations that are associated with familial TAAD change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the smooth muscle α-2 actin protein. These changes likely affect the way the protein functions in smooth muscle contraction, interfering with the sarcomeres' ability to prevent arteries from stretching. The aorta, where the force of pumping blood coming directly from the heart is most intense, is particularly vulnerable to this stretching, resulting in the aortic aneurysms and dissections associated with familial TAAD. "
36,ACTB ,actin beta,"The ACTB gene provides instructions for making a protein called beta (β)-actin, which is part of the actin protein family. Proteins in this family are organized into a network of fibers called the actin cytoskeleton, which makes up the structural framework inside cells. There are six types of actin; four are present only in muscle cells, where they are involved in the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction). The other two actin proteins, β-actin and gamma (γ)-actin (produced from the ACTG1 gene), are found in cells throughout the body. These proteins play important roles in determining cell shape and controlling cell movement (motility). Studies suggest that β-actin may also be involved in relaying chemical signals within cells.","Baraitser-Winter syndrome Several mutations in the ACTB gene have been found to cause Baraitser-Winter syndrome, a rare condition that affects the development of the brain, eyes, and other facial features. The known mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in β-actin. The most common mutation replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid histidine at protein position 196 (written as Arg196His or R196H). The mutations that cause Baraitser-Winter syndrome alter the function of β-actin, which causes changes in the actin cytoskeleton that modify the structure and organization of cells and affect their ability to move. Because β-actin is present in cells throughout the body and is involved in many cell activities, problems with its function likely impact many aspects of development. These changes underlie the variety of signs and symptoms associated with Baraitser-Winter syndrome. "
37,ACTG1 ,actin gamma 1,"The ACTG1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called gamma (γ)-actin, which is part of the actin protein family. Proteins in this family are organized into a network of fibers called the actin cytoskeleton, which makes up the structural framework inside cells. There are six types of actin; four are present only in muscle cells, where they are involved in the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction). The other two actin proteins, γ-actin and beta (β)-actin (produced from the ACTB gene), are found in cells throughout the body. These proteins play important roles in determining cell shape and controlling cell movement (motility).γ-actin is particularly abundant in certain cells in the intestines and the inner ear. Within the inner ear, this protein is found in specialized cells called hair cells, which are essential for normal hearing.","Baraitser-Winter syndrome At least six mutations in the ACTG1 gene have been found to cause Baraitser-Winter syndrome, a rare condition that affects the development of the brain, eyes, and other facial features. The known mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in γ-actin. The most common mutation replaces the amino acid serine with the amino acid phenylalanine at protein position 155 (written as Ser155Phe or S155F). The mutations that cause Baraitser-Winter syndrome alter the function of γ-actin, which causes changes in the actin cytoskeleton that modify the structure and organization of cells and affect their ability to move. Because γ-actin is present in cells throughout the body and is involved in many cell activities, problems with its function likely impact many aspects of development. These changes underlie the variety of signs and symptoms associated with Baraitser-Winter syndrome. "
38,ACTG2 ,"actin, gamma 2, smooth muscle, enteric","The ACTG2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called gamma (γ)-2 actin, which is part of the actin protein family. Actin proteins are organized into filaments, which are important for the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction) and cell movement. These filaments also help maintain the cytoskeleton, which is the structural framework that determines cell shape and organizes cell contents.The γ-2 actin protein is found in smooth muscle cells of the urinary and intestinal tracts. Smooth muscles line the internal organs; they contract and relax without being consciously controlled. The γ-2 actin protein is necessary for contraction of the smooth muscles in the bladder and intestines. These contractions empty urine from the bladder and move food through the intestines as part of the digestive process.","Intestinal pseudo-obstruction Several inherited mutations in the ACTG2 gene have been identified in people with intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a condition that impairs the smooth muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract (peristalsis). This condition mimics a physical blockage of the intestines without an actual obstruction. Problems with emptying the bladder can also occur in people with this disorder.The ACTG2 gene mutations that cause intestinal pseudo-obstruction are thought to hinder the formation of actin filaments in the cytoskeleton and reduce the ability of smooth muscles in the intestines and bladder to contract. As a result, peristalsis in the intestines is impaired and the bladder is less able to contract and expel urine, leading to the signs and symptoms of this condition. "
39,ACVR1 ,activin A receptor type 1,"The ACVR1 gene provides instructions for making the activin receptor type-1 (ACVR1) protein, which is a member of a protein family called bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptors. BMP receptors span the cell membrane, so that one end of the protein remains inside the cell and the other end projects from the outer surface of the cell. This arrangement allows receptors to receive signals from outside the cell and transmit them inside to affect cell development and function.The ACVR1 protein is found in many tissues of the body including skeletal muscle and cartilage. It helps to control the growth and development of the bones and muscles, including the gradual replacement of cartilage by bone (ossification). This process occurs in normal skeletal maturation from birth to young adulthood.The ACVR1 protein is normally turned on (activated) at appropriate times by molecules called ligands. Activation may occur when these ligands, such as BMPs or a protein called activin A, attach (bind) to the receptor or to other proteins with which it forms a complex. Another protein called FKBP12 can turn off (inhibit) ACVR1 by binding to the receptor and preventing inappropriate (leaky) activation in the absence of ligands.","Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva Mutations in the ACVR1 gene cause fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, a disorder in which muscles and connective tissue such as tendons and ligaments are gradually replaced by bone (ossified). The formation of bone tissue outside the skeleton freezes joints and limits movement in affected individuals. The most common mutation, which occurs in all individuals with the classic features of the condition, substitues the protein building block (amino acid) histidine for the amino acid arginine at position 206 of the ACVR1 protein (written as Arg206His or R206H). Other mutations in the ACVR1 gene cause rarer forms of the condition that can be more severe and often involve skeletal abnormalities, such as multiple abnormally formed fingers and toes.Studies show that the R206H mutation changes the shape of the ACVR1 protein. This shape change disrupts the binding of the inhibitor protein FKBP12. As a result, the receptor is constantly turned on (constitutively activated), even in the absence of ligands. Other ACVR1 gene mutations result in a receptor protein that is turned on by ligands more easily than the normal version of the protein. Too much receptor activity causes overgrowth of bone and cartilage, resulting in the signs and symptoms of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. "
40,ACVRL1 ,activin A receptor like type 1,"The ACVRL1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called activin receptor-like kinase 1. This protein is found on the surface of cells, especially in the lining of developing arteries.The ACVRL1 protein is a receptor. It acts as a ""lock"" waiting for a specific protein, called its ligand, to serve as the ""key."" In the case of the ACVRL1 protein, the ligand is called transforming growth factor beta. The interaction between these proteins plays a role in the development of blood vessels. In particular, this protein interaction is involved in the specialization of new blood vessels into arteries or veins.","Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia Dozens of mutations in the ACVRL1 gene have been found to cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2. Many ACVRL1 gene mutations substitute one protein building block (amino acid) for another amino acid in the ACVRL1 protein, which impairs the protein's function. Other mutations prevent production of the ACVRL1 protein or result in an abnormally small protein that cannot function. The shortage of functional ACVRL1 protein appears to interfere with the development of boundaries between arteries and veins, resulting in the signs and symptoms of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2. "
41,ACY1 ,aminoacylase 1,"The ACY1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aminoacylase 1, which is found in many tissues and organs, including the kidneys and the brain. This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of proteinswhen they are no longer needed. Many proteins in the body have a chemical group called an acetyl group attached to one end. This modification, called N-acetylation, helps protect and stabilize the protein. Aminoacylase 1 performs the final step in the breakdown of these proteins by removing the acetyl group from certain protein building blocks (amino acids). The amino acids can then be recycled and used to build other proteins.","Aminoacylase 1 deficiency Several mutations in the ACY1 gene have been identified in people with a condition called aminoacylase 1 deficiency. This condition is characterized by delayed development of mental and motor skills and other neurological problems, although some people with the condition have no signs or symptoms. Most of the associated ACY1 gene mutations change single amino acids in the aminoacylase 1 enzyme. These and other ACY1 gene mutations lead to production of an aminoacylase 1 enzyme with little or no function. Without this enzyme's function, acetyl groups are not efficiently removed from a subset of amino acids (including methionine, glutamic acid, alanine, serine, glycine, leucine, valine, threonine, and isoleucine) during the breakdown of proteins. The excess N-acetylated amino acids are released from the body in urine. It is not known how a reduction of aminoacylase 1 function leads to neurological problems in people with aminoacylase 1 deficiency. "
42,ADA ,adenosine deaminase,"The ADA gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme adenosine deaminase. This enzyme is produced in all cells, but the highest levels of adenosine deaminase occur in immune system cells called lymphocytes, which develop in lymphoid tissues. These lymphoid tissues include the thymus, which is a gland located behind the breastbone, and lymph nodes, which are found throughout the body. Lymphocytes form the immune system, which defends the body against potentially harmful invaders, such as viruses or bacteria.The function of the adenosine deaminase enzyme is to eliminate a molecule called deoxyadenosine, which is generated when DNA is broken down. Adenosine deaminase converts deoxyadenosine, which is toxic to lymphocytes, to another molecule called deoxyinosine, which is not harmful.","Adenosine deaminase deficiency More than 70 mutations in the ADA gene have been identified. Most of these mutations result in the substitution of one protein building block (amino acid) for another amino acid in the adenosine deaminase enzyme. Other mutations cause the enzyme to be unstable or prevent it from being produced at all.These mutations result in the absence or deficiency of the adenosine deaminase enzyme in cells, preventing the normal breakdown of deoxyadenosine. A buildup of this toxic compound interferes with the development and maintenance of lymphocytes, resulting in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which is characteristic of adenosine deaminase deficiency. "
43,ADA2 ,adenosine deaminase 2,"The ADA2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called adenosine deaminase 2. This enzyme breaks down molecules called adenosine and 2'-deoxyadenosine. Because this enzyme functions in the spaces between cells, it is described as extracellular. Another form of the enzyme, adenosine deaminase 1, breaks down the same molecules inside cells. This other version of the enzyme is produced from the ADA gene.Researchers are still working to determine the functions of adenosine deaminase 2. Studies suggest that it acts as a growth factor, which means that it stimulates cell growth and division. In particular, the enzyme appears to be involved in the growth and development of certain immune system cells, including macrophages, which are a type of white blood cell that plays a critical role in inflammation. Inflammation is a normal immune system response to injury and foreign invaders (such as bacteria). Some macrophages are pro-inflammatory, meaning they promote inflammation, while others are anti-inflammatory, meaning they reduce inflammation.","Adenosine deaminase 2 deficiency More than 60 mutations in the ADA2 gene have been found to cause adenosine deaminase 2 deficiency, a disorder characterized by abnormal inflammation of various organs and tissues, particularly the blood vessels (vasculitis). These mutations severely reduce or eliminate the function of adenosine deaminase 2. Researchers do not fully understand how a shortage (deficiency) of this enzyme's activity leads to vasculitis and immune system abnormalities. They speculate that the enzyme deficiency may disrupt the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory macrophages in various tissues, leading to a buildup of pro-inflammatory macrophages and abnormal inflammation. "
44,ADAMTS2 ,ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 2,"The ADAMTS2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that processes several types of procollagen molecules. Procollagens are the precursors of collagens, which are complex molecules found in the spaces between cells that add strength, support, and stretchiness (elasticity) to many body tissues. The ADAMTS2 enzyme cuts a short chain of protein building blocks (amino acids) off one end of procollagens. This clipping step is necessary for the resulting collagen molecules to assemble into strong, slender fibrils.","Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Several mutations in the ADAMTS2 gene have been identified in people with a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome called the dermatosparaxis type. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect the connective tissues supporting the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues. The dermatosparaxis type is characterized by soft, fragile skin that sags and wrinkles; easy bruising; and distinctive facial features.Mutations in the ADAMTS2 gene greatly reduce the production or activity of the ADAMTS2 enzyme. Without enough of this enzyme, procollagens cannot be processed correctly. As a result, collagen fibrils are not assembled properly. The resulting fibrils are disorganized, which weakens connective tissues and leads to the signs and symptoms of the disorder. "
45,ADAMTS10 ,ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 10,"The ADAMTS10 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found in many of the body's cells and tissues. This enzyme is part of a family of metalloproteases, which are zinc-containing enzymes that cut apart other proteins. Although the function of the ADAMTS10 enzyme is unknown, it is critical for growth before and after birth. Researchers believe that it may be involved in the development of structures including the skin, eyes, heart, and skeleton.","Weill-Marchesani syndrome At least five mutations in the ADAMTS10 gene have been identified in people with Weill-Marchesani syndrome. Each of these mutations prevents the cell from producing any functional ADAMTS10 enzyme. Researchers speculate that a loss of this enzyme disrupts skeletal development, leading to short stature and unusually short fingers and toes (brachydactyly). A shortage of the ADAMTS10 enzyme also interferes with the development and function of the lens of the eye, causing eye abnormalities and impaired vision. Additionally, a lack of this enzyme may disrupt the normal development of the heart, resulting in the heart defects occasionally seen in people with Weill-Marchesani syndrome. "
46,ADAMTS13 ,ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 13,"The ADAMTS13 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is involved in blood clotting. After an injury, clots normally protect the body by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss.The ADAMTS13 enzyme processes a large protein called von Willebrand factor, which also plays a role in clot formation. The unprocessed form of von Willebrand factor interacts easily with cells called platelets, which circulate in the bloodstream and are essential for blood clotting. The factor helps platelets stick together and adhere to the walls of blood vessels, forming temporary clots. The ADAMTS13 enzyme cuts von Willebrand factor into smaller pieces. By processing von Willebrand factor in this way, the enzyme prevents it from triggering the formation of unnecessary blood clots.","Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura More than 70 mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene have been reported in people with the familial form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ADAMTS13 enzyme. Other mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small version of the enzyme that cannot function properly.Mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene severely reduce the activity of the ADAMTS13 enzyme. As a result, von Willebrand factor is not processed normally in the bloodstream. If the factor is not cut into smaller fragments by the ADAMTS13 enzyme, it promotes the formation of abnormal clots throughout the body. The large, uncut version of von Willebrand factor induces platelets to stick together and adhere to the walls of blood vessels, even in the absence of injury. Additional factors such as pregnancy, diarrhea, surgery, and infection likely play a role in triggering abnormal clotting. Blood clots can block blood flow through small vessels, causing damage to the brain, kidneys, heart, and other organs. Abnormal clotting also causes other complications associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. "
47,ADAMTSL2 ,ADAMTS like 2,"The ADAMTSL2 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. The ADAMTSL2 protein is active in many different tissues. It is found in the extracellular matrix, which is the intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells.Studies suggest that the ADAMTSL2 protein interacts with a protein called latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 1 (LTBP1). The LTBP1 protein is involved in the storage of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), a critical growth factor that helps control the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (motility), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). Through its interaction with the LTBP1 protein, researchers suspect that the ADAMTSL2 protein may help regulate the availability of TGF-β.The interaction between the ADAMTSL2 protein and the LTBP1 protein suggests that ADAMTSL2 may also play a role in the microfibrillar network. This organized clustering of thread-like filaments (called microfibrils) in the extracellular matrix provides strength and flexibility to tissues throughout the body.","Geleophysic dysplasia At least five mutations in the ADAMTSL2 gene have been identified in people with geleophysic dysplasia. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ADAMTSL2 protein, which probably alters the protein's 3-dimensional shape.Through a process that is poorly understood, ADAMTSL2 gene mutations alter the microfibrillar network in many different tissues. Impairment of this essential network disrupts the normal functions of cells, which likely contributes to the varied signs and symptoms of geleophysic dysplasia. Researchers are working to determine how mutations in the ADAMTSL2 gene lead to short stature, heart disease, and the other features of this condition. "
48,ADAMTSL4 ,ADAMTS like 4,"The ADAMTSL4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found throughout the body. The ADAMTSL4 protein is released from cells into the extracellular matrix, which is an intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. In this matrix, the ADAMTSL4 protein attaches (binds) to another protein called fibrillin-1. Fibrillin-1 proteins bind to each other and other proteins to form threadlike filaments called microfibrils. It is likely that the binding of ADAMTSL4 to fibrillin-1 promotes microfibril assembly. Microfibrils provide support to many tissues, including the lenses of the eyes, which are held in their central position by these filaments.","Isolated ectopia lentis At least 15 mutations in the ADAMTSL4 gene have been found to cause isolated ectopia lentis. In this condition, the lens in one or both eyes is off-center (displaced), which leads to vision problems. An ADAMTSL4 gene mutation that is frequently found in affected individuals of European ancestry deletes 20 DNA building blocks (nucleotides) from the gene (written as 767_787del20). This mutation leads to the production of a protein that is abnormally short and nonfunctional. A lack of functional ADAMTSL4 protein likely diminishes the ability of fibrillin-1 to effectively form microfibrils. As a result, there is a reduction in filaments to anchor the lens in its central position at the front of the eye, leading to its displacement and the vision problems characteristic of isolated ectopia lentis. While the ADAMTSL4 protein is found throughout the body, it is thought that other proteins can compensate for its function in tissues other than the eyes, which likely explains why only the eyes are affected in this condition. "
49,ADAR ,"adenosine deaminase, RNA specific","The ADAR gene provides instructions for making a protein called RNA-specific adenosine deaminase 1 (ADAR1). This protein is involved in making changes to (editing) ribonucleic acid (RNA), a chemical cousin of DNA. Specifically, it attaches (binds) to RNA and changes an RNA building block (nucleotide) called adenosine to another nucleotide called inosine.The ADAR1 protein is involved in the control of the innate immune response, which is the immune system's early response to foreign invaders (pathogens). The adenosine-to-inosine editing performed by ADAR1 is thought to change certain areas of the body's own RNA that the immune system might interpret as belonging to a virus that should be attacked. In this way, the protein helps the immune system avoid inappropriate targeting of the body's own tissues.The ADAR1 protein is also thought to inhibit the replication and spread of certain viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C, by modifying their RNA. In addition, the ADAR1 protein controls the function of certain chemical messengers called neurotransmitters at particular sites in the body by modifying the RNA blueprint for receptor proteins that interact with the neurotransmitters. Studies suggest that the ADAR1 protein may have other functions that are not well understood.","Aicardi-Goutières syndrome At least 30 ADAR gene mutations have been identified in people with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, a disorder that involves severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), skin lesions, immune system abnormalities, and other health problems. Some of these mutations lead to an ADAR1 protein that is less able to bind to RNA; others impair the protein's RNA editing function. As a result, control of the immune response is impaired and the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs, leading to the signs and symptoms of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. "
50,ADCY5 ,adenylate cyclase 5,"The ADCY5 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called adenylate cyclase 5. This enzyme helps convert a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to another molecule called cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). ATP is a molecule that supplies energy for cells' activities, including muscle contraction, and cAMP is involved in signaling for many cellular functions.","ADCY5-related dyskinesia At least six ADCY5 gene mutations have been identified in people with ADCY5-related dyskinesia, a disorder that causes abnormal involuntary movements. These mutations are thought to enhance adenylate cyclase 5 enzyme activity and lead to higher levels of cAMP within cells, so they are described as ""gain-of-function"" mutations. Other ADCY5 gene mutations prevent production of adenylate cyclase 5. It is unclear how either type of mutation leads to the abnormal movements that occur in this disorder. "
51,ADGRE2 ,adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E2,"The ADGRE2 gene provides instructions for making a protein found in several types of immune system cells, including mast cells. Mast cells, which are found in many body tissues including the skin, are important for the normal protective functions of the immune system. They also play a role in allergic reactions, which occur when the immune system overreacts to stimuli that are not harmful. The specific role of the ADGRE2 protein in mast cells is not well understood.The ADGRE2 protein consists of two parts (subunits) that interact with each other: an alpha subunit that lies on the outside surface of the cell and a beta subunit that crosses the cell membrane and extends into the cell.","Vibratory urticaria At least one mutation in the ADGRE2 gene has been identified in people with vibratory urticaria, a condition in which vibration, repetitive stretching, or friction on the skin results in allergy symptoms such as hives (urticaria), swelling (angioedema), redness (erythema), and itching (pruritus) in the affected area. The reaction can be brought on by towel drying, hand clapping, running, a bumpy ride in a vehicle, or other repetitive stimulation.The ADGRE2 gene mutation that causes vibratory urticaria, written as Cys492Tyr or C492Y, replaces the protein building block (amino acid) cysteine with the amino acid tyrosine at position 492 of the protein sequence. The substitution alters the protein structure and leads to a less stable interaction between the two subunits. This fragile connection can be more easily broken; vibration, friction, or stretching of the skin can disrupt the association between subunits in mast cells. Researchers suggest that once the subunits are disconnected, the beta subunit signals the mast cells to react and produce the allergy symptoms in the skin that occur in vibratory urticaria. "
52,ADGRG1 ,adhesion G protein-coupled receptor G1,"The ADGRG1 gene, formerly known as GPR56, provides instructions for making a protein that is critical for normal brain development. Before birth, the ADGRG1 protein appears to be essential for the normal growth and movement (migration) of nerve cells (neurons) in a part of the brain called the cerebral cortex. This outer layer of the brain carries out many important functions, such as sensation, voluntary muscle movement, thought, planning, and memory.Although the ADGRG1 protein has been studied most extensively in the brain, it is active in many of the body's tissues. This protein interacts with other proteins on the cell surface to trigger a series of chemical signals within the cell. Studies suggest that ADGRG1 signaling may play an important role in attaching cells to one another (cell adhesion).","Polymicrogyria At least eleven mutations in the ADGRG1 gene have been identified in people with a severe form of polymicrogyria called bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP). This disorder causes intellectual disability, delayed development, problems with speech and movement, and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). Most of the identified mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the ADGRG1 protein. These mutations interfere with the normal processing of the protein. The abnormal protein becomes trapped within the cell, where it is unable to reach the cell surface to carry out its normal signaling functions.A loss of ADGRG1 protein function likely disrupts the normal migration of neurons in the developing brain. As a result, certain regions of the cerebral cortex—areas known as the frontal and parietal lobes—develop too many folds (called gyri), and the folds are unusually small. These brain abnormalities cause intellectual disability and the other neurological problems associated with bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria. "
53,ADNP ,activity dependent neuroprotector homeobox,"The ADNP gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control the activity (expression) of other genes through a process called chromatin remodeling. Chromatin is the network of DNA and protein that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. Chromatin remodeling is one way gene expression is regulated during development; when DNA is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when DNA is loosely packed. As part of the remodeling process, the ADNP protein attaches to DNA and interacts with groups of proteins called SWI/SNF complexes, which direct changes in the structure of chromatin.By regulating gene expression, the ADNP protein is involved in many aspects of development. It is particularly important for regulation of genes involved in normal brain development, and it likely controls the activity of genes that direct the development and function of other body systems.","ADNP syndrome At least 22 ADNP gene mutations have been found to cause ADNP syndrome. This condition features intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, which is characterized by impaired communication and social interactions. Affected individuals can also have distinctive facial features and a wide variety of other signs and symptoms. Most ADNP gene mutations are thought to lead to the production of an abnormally short ADNP protein. Although it is unclear how these genetic changes cause ADNP syndrome, researchers speculate that the abnormally short protein can attach to DNA but cannot interact with SWI/SNF complexes. As a result, chromatin remodeling is impaired. Disturbance of this process alters the activity of many genes and disrupts the development or function of several of the body's tissues and organs, including the brain. These changes likely explain the intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and other diverse signs and symptoms of ADNP syndrome. "
54,ADSL ,adenylosuccinate lyase,"The ADSL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called adenylosuccinate lyase. This enzyme performs two steps in the process that produces (synthesizes) purine nucleotides. These nucleotides are building blocks of DNA, its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as ATP that serve as energy sources in the cell. Adenylosuccinate lyase and other enzymes involved in purine synthesis form a group of proteins (a protein complex) called the purinosome. This complex comes together when there is a shortage of purines or when a large amount of purines is needed, such as during cell division. As part of this complex, adenylosuccinate lyase converts a molecule called succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (SAICAR) to aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (AICAR) and converts succinyladenosine monophosphate (SAMP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP).","Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency More than 50 mutations in the ADSL gene have been found to cause adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency. This condition causes brain dysfunction (encephalopathy) that leads to delayed development of mental and motor skills (psychomotor delay), autistic behaviors that affect communication and social interaction, and seizures. Most of the mutations involved in this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the adenylosuccinate lyase enzyme. The altered enzymes have two to 20 percent of normal function, and studies suggest they are less able to form stable purinosomes.A reduction of adenylosuccinate lyase function, possibly due to a shortage of purinosomes, leads to buildup of SAICAR and SAMP. These substances are converted through a different reaction to succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICAr) and succinyladenosine (S-Ado). Detection of these substances in body fluids can help with diagnosis of adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency. Researchers believe that SAICAr and S-Ado are toxic; damage to brain tissue caused by one or both of these substances likely underlies the neurological problems that occur in adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency.Studies suggest that the amount of SAICAr relative to S-Ado reflects the severity of adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency. Individuals with more SAICAr than S-Ado have more severe encephalopathy and psychomotor delay. "
55,AFF2 ,AF4/FMR2 family member 2,"The AFF2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in the nucleus of cells but whose function is not well understood. Some studies suggest that it acts as a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of other genes, although the identity of these genes is unknown. Other studies show that the protein can attach to specific regions of messenger RNA (mRNA), which is a chemical cousin of DNA that serves as the genetic blueprint for protein production. It is thought that the AFF2 protein helps control the process by which the mRNA blueprint is cut and rearranged to produce different versions of proteins (alternative splicing).One region of the AFF2 gene contains a particular DNA segment known as a CCG trinucleotide repeat, so called because this segment of three DNA building blocks (nucleotides) is repeated multiple times within the gene. In most people, the number of CCG repeats ranges from 4 to about 40.","Fragile XE syndrome Mutations in the AFF2 gene cause fragile XE syndrome, a condition characterized by mild intellectual disability and learning difficulties. Nearly all cases are caused by a mutation called a CCG trinucleotide repeat expansion, in which the CCG trinucleotide is abnormally repeated more than 200 times, which makes this region of the gene unstable. As a result, the AFF2 gene is turned off (silenced), and no protein is produced from it. It is unclear how a shortage of this protein leads to problems with intellectual functioning.Rarely, small deletions of genetic material from the AFF2 gene are associated with fragile XE syndrome, although how these deletions affect the protein and lead to intellectual disability is unknown. "
56,AFF4 ,AF4/FMR2 family member 4,"The AFF4 gene provides instructions for making part of a protein complex called the super elongation complex (SEC). During embryonic development, the SEC is involved in an activity called transcription, which is the first step in the production of proteins from genes. By re-starting the transcription of certain genes after pauses that normally occur during the process, the SEC helps ensure that development proceeds appropriately before birth.","CHOPS syndrome Mutations in the AFF4 gene cause CHOPS syndrome, a disorder involving multiple abnormalities that are present from birth (congenital). The name ""CHOPS"" is an abbreviation for a list of features of the disorder including cognitive impairment, coarse facial features, heart defects, obesity, lung (pulmonary) involvement, short stature, and skeletal abnormalities.The AFF4 gene mutations identified in people with CHOPS syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the AFF4 protein. These mutations are thought to result in an AFF4 protein that is not broken down when it is no longer needed, so more AFF4 protein is available than usual. The excess AFF4 protein interferes with normal pauses in transcription. This dysregulation of transcription leads to problems in the development of multiple organs and tissues, resulting in the signs and symptoms of CHOPS syndrome. "
57,AGA ,aspartylglucosaminidase,"The AGA gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called aspartylglucosaminidase. This enzyme is active in lysosomes, which are structures inside cells that act as recycling centers. Within lysosomes, the enzyme helps break down complexes of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) attached to certain proteins (glycoproteins). Specifically, this enzyme cuts glycoproteins between a protein building block (amino acid) called asparagine and a sugar molecule called N-acetylglucosamine. This cut is one of the last steps in breaking down a glycoprotein in the lysosome.","Aspartylglucosaminuria More than 30 mutations in the AGA gene have been found to cause aspartylglucosaminuria. Most of these mutations change one amino acid in aspartylglucosaminidase. One mutation found in 98 percent of people with this condition in Finland replaces the amino acid cysteine with the amino acid serine at position 163 in the enzyme (written as Cys163Ser or C163S). Many mutations, including C163S, disrupt the proper folding of aspartylglucosaminidase, resulting in an enzyme that cannot effectively break down glycoproteins. A buildup of glycoproteins seems to particularly affect nerve cells in the brain; loss of these cells causes a progressive decline in mental functioning and the other signs and symptoms of aspartylglucosaminuria. "
58,AGL ,"amylo-alpha-1, 6-glucosidase, 4-alpha-glucanotransferase","The AGL gene provides instructions for making the glycogen debranching enzyme. This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of a complex sugar called glycogen, which is a major source of stored energy in the body. Glycogen is made up of several molecules of a simple sugar called glucose. Some glucose molecules are linked together in a straight line, while others branch off and form side chains. The glycogen debranching enzyme is involved in the breakdown of these side chains. The branched structure of glycogen makes it more compact for storage and allows it to break down more easily when it is needed for fuel.The AGL gene provides instructions for making several different versions (isoforms) of the glycogen debranching enzyme. These isoforms vary by size and are active (expressed) in different tissues.","Glycogen storage disease type III Approximately 100 mutations in the AGL gene have been found to cause glycogen storage disease type III (also called GSDIII or Cori disease). Most of these mutations lead to a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the glycogen debranching enzyme, resulting in a nonfunctional enzyme. As a result, the side chains of glycogen molecules cannot be removed and abnormal, partially broken down glycogen molecules are stored within cells. A buildup of abnormal glycogen damages organs and tissues throughout the body, particularly the liver and muscles, leading to the signs and symptoms of GSDIII.Mutations in the AGL gene can affect different isoforms of the enzyme, depending on where the mutations are located in the gene. For example, mutations that occur in a part of the AGL gene called exon 3 affect the isoform that is primarily expressed in the liver. These mutations almost always lead to GSD type IIIb, which is characterized by liver problems. "
59,AGPAT2 ,1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 2,"The AGPAT2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found in many of the body's cells and tissues. It plays a critical role in the growth and development of adipocytes, which are cells that store fats for energy. Adipocytes are the major component of the body's fatty (adipose) tissue.The AGPAT2 enzyme is part of a chemical pathway in many cells that produces two important types of fats (lipids): glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerols. Glycerophospholipids are the major component of cell membranes and are involved in chemical signaling within cells. Triacylglycerols (also known as triglycerides) are fat molecules that are stored in adipocytes for later conversion to energy.The AGPAT2 enzyme is responsible for a particular chemical reaction in the production of these two types of lipids. Specifically, the enzyme helps convert a molecule called lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to another molecule, phosphatidic acid (PA). Additional reactions convert phosphatidic acid to glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerols.","Congenital generalized lipodystrophy At least 26 mutations in the AGPAT2 gene have been identified in people with congenital generalized lipodystrophy (also called Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy) type 1. This rare condition is characterized by an almost total absence of adipose tissue and a very muscular appearance. A shortage of adipose tissue leads to multiple health problems, including high levels of triglycerides circulating in the bloodstream (hypertriglyceridemia) and diabetes mellitus.The AGPAT2 gene mutations that cause congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 1 greatly reduce or eliminate the activity of the AGPAT2 enzyme. Studies suggest that a loss of this enzyme's activity reduces the production and storage of triacylglycerols in adipocytes, which prevents these cells from storing fats. A lack of enzyme activity may also reduce the levels of glycerophospholipids in adipocytes, which changes the structure of the cell membrane and disrupts normal signaling within these cells. All of these abnormalities prevent the body from storing fats normally in adipose tissue. The resulting lack of body fat underlies the varied signs and symptoms of congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 1. "
60,AGPS ,alkylglycerone phosphate synthase,"The AGPS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme known as alkylglycerone phosphate synthase. This enzyme is found in structures called peroxisomes, which are sac-like compartments within cells that contain enzymes needed to break down many different substances. Peroxisomes are also important for the production of fats (lipids) used in digestion and in the nervous system.Within peroxisomes, alkylglycerone phosphate synthase is responsible for a critical step in the production of lipid molecules called plasmalogens. These molecules are found in cell membranes throughout the body. They are also abundant in myelin, which is the protective substance that covers nerve cells. However, little is known about the functions of plasmalogens. Researchers suspect that these molecules may help protect cells from oxidative stress, which occurs when unstable molecules called free radicals accumulate to levels that damage or kill cells. Plasmalogens may also play important roles in interactions between lipids and proteins, the transmission of chemical signals in cells, and the fusion of cell membranes.","Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata At least three mutations in the AGPS gene have been found to cause rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 3 (RCDP3). These mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in alkylglycerone phosphate synthase, which alters the structure of the enzyme and significantly reduces its activity. A shortage of functional alkylglycerone phosphate synthase disrupts peroxisome function and severely reduces the amount of plasmalogens within cells. It is unclear how these abnormalities lead to shortened long bones, intellectual disability, and the other characteristic features of RCDP3. "
61,AGT ,angiotensinogen,"The AGT gene provides instructions for making a protein called angiotensinogen. This protein is part of the renin-angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure and the balance of fluids and salts in the body. In the first step of this process, angiotensinogen is converted to angiotensin I. Through an additional step, angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to narrow (constrict), which results in increased blood pressure. This molecule also stimulates production of the hormone aldosterone, which triggers the absorption of salt and water by the kidneys. The increased amount of fluid in the body also increases blood pressure. Proper blood pressure during fetal growth, which delivers oxygen to the developing tissues, is required for normal development of the kidneys, particularly of structures called the proximal tubules, and other tissues. In addition, angiotensin II may play a more direct role in kidney development, perhaps by affecting growth factors involved in the development of kidney structures.","Renal tubular dysgenesis At least six mutations in the AGT gene have been found to cause a severe kidney disorder called renal tubular dysgenesis. This condition is characterized by abnormal kidney development before birth, the inability to produce urine (anuria), and severe low blood pressure (hypotension). These problems result in a reduction of amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios), which leads to a set of birth defects known as the Potter sequence.Renal tubular dysgenesis can be caused by mutations in both copies of any of the genes involved in the renin-angiotensin system. Most of the mutations in the AGT gene that cause this disorder change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the angiotensinogen protein. These changes occur in a region of the protein that is necessary for its conversion to angiotensin I. It is thought that the altered angiotensinogen cannot be converted, leading to a nonfunctional renin-angiotensin system. Without this system, the kidneys cannot control blood pressure. Because of low blood pressure, the flow of blood is reduced (hypoperfusion), and the body does not get enough oxygen during fetal development. As a result, kidney development is impaired, leading to the features of renal tubular dysgenesis. "
62,AGTR1 ,angiotensin II receptor type 1,"The AGTR1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1 receptor). This protein is part of the renin-angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure and the balance of fluids and salts in the body. Through a series of steps, the renin-angiotensin system produces a molecule called angiotensin II, which attaches (binds) to the AT1 receptor, stimulating chemical signaling. This signaling causes blood vessels to narrow (constrict), which results in increased blood pressure. Binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor also stimulates production of the hormone aldosterone, which triggers the absorption of water and salt by the kidneys. The increased amount of fluid in the body also increases blood pressure. Proper blood pressure during fetal growth, which delivers oxygen to the developing tissues, is required for normal development of the kidneys, particularly of structures called the proximal tubules, and other tissues. In addition, angiotensin II may play a more direct role in kidney development, perhaps by affecting growth factors involved in the development of kidney structures.","Renal tubular dysgenesis At least four mutations in the AGTR1 gene have been found to cause a severe kidney disorder called renal tubular dysgenesis. This condition is characterized by abnormal kidney development before birth, the inability to produce urine (anuria), and severe low blood pressure (hypotension). These problems result in a reduction of amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios), which leads to a set of birth defects known as the Potter sequence.Renal tubular dysgenesis can be caused by mutations in both copies of any of the genes involved in the renin-angiotensin system. The AGTR1 gene mutations that cause this disorder likely change or block the AT1 receptor's ability to stimulate signaling, which results in a nonfunctional renin-angiotensin system. Without this system, the kidneys cannot control blood pressure. Because of low blood pressure, the flow of blood is reduced (hypoperfusion), and the body does not get enough oxygen during fetal development. As a result, kidney development is impaired, leading to the features of renal tubular dysgenesis. "
63,AGXT ,alanine--glyoxylate and serine--pyruvate aminotransferase,"The AGXT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called serine-pyruvate aminotransferase. This enzyme is found in liver cells, specifically within cell structures called peroxisomes. These structures are important for several cellular activities, such as ridding the cell of toxic substances and helping to break down certain fats. In the peroxisome, serine-pyruvate aminotransferase converts a compound called glyoxylate to the protein building block (amino acid) glycine.","Primary hyperoxaluria More than 175 mutations in the AGXT gene have been found to cause primary hyperoxaluria type 1. This condition is caused by the overproduction of a substance called oxalate. Excess amounts of this substance lead to kidney and bladder stones, which can begin anytime from childhood to early adulthood with kidney disease developing at any age. Deposition of oxalate in multiple other tissues throughout the body (systemic oxalosis) can cause additional health problems.Most of the AGXT gene mutations decrease or eliminate serine-pyruvate aminotransferase activity, which impairs the conversion of glyoxylate to glycine. Other mutations cause the enzyme to be misplaced in cells, transporting it to structures called mitochondria instead of to peroxisomes. While the enzyme in the mitochondria retains activity, it cannot access glyoxylate, which is in peroxisomes. All AGXT gene mutations result in the accumulation of glyoxylate, which is converted to oxalate instead of glycine. The oxalate is filtered through the kidneys and is either excreted in urine as a waste product or combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate, a hard compound that is the main component of kidney and bladder stones. Increased oxalate levels in the blood can lead to systemic oxalosis, particularly affecting bones and the walls of blood vessels in people with primary hyperoxaluria type 1. "
64,AHCY ,adenosylhomocysteinase,"The AHCY gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase. This enzyme is involved in a multistep process that breaks down the protein building block (amino acid) methionine. Specifically, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase controls the step that converts the compound S-adenosylhomocysteine to the compounds adenosine and homocysteine. This reaction also plays an important role in regulating the addition of methyl groups, consisting of one carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms, to other compounds (methylation). Methylation is important in many cellular processes. These include determining whether the instructions in a particular segment of DNA are carried out, regulating reactions involving proteins and lipids, and controlling the processing of chemicals that relay signals in the nervous system (neurotransmitters).","Hypermethioninemia Three mutations in the AHCY gene have been described in people with hypermethioninemia. In a Croatian family, one mutation substitutes the amino acid cysteine for the amino acid tyrosine at protein position 143 (written as Tyr143Cys or Y143C). Another mutation replaces the amino acid tryptophan with a premature stop signal at position 112 (written as Trp112X or W112X), resulting in an enzyme that is abnormally short. A U.S. patient was found to have, in addition to the Y143C mutation, a mutation that substitutes the amino acid valine for the amino acid alanine at position 89 (written as Ala89Val or A89V). These mutations reduce the activity of the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase enzyme, resulting in the signs and symptoms of hypermethioninemia. "
65,AHDC1 ,AT-hook DNA binding motif containing 1,"The AHDC1 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not known. The AHDC1 protein is found in the nucleus of cells, and a region of the protein is thought to allow it to attach (bind) to DNA. Based on its location and possible DNA-binding ability, researchers suspect the protein may help control the activity of other genes.","Xia-Gibbs syndrome More than 25 mutations in the AHDC1 gene have been found to cause Xia-Gibbs syndrome, a neurological disorder characterized by intellectual disability and delayed speech development. A variety of other signs and symptoms can also occur in this disorder, such as weak muscle tone, growth impairment, and unusual facial features. Most of the AHDC1 gene mutations involved in Xia-Gibbs syndrome lead to production of abnormally short AHDC1 proteins. The effects of these changes in cells are unclear. The shortened proteins may be quickly broken down or be unable to function. Or, the abnormal proteins may interfere with the function of AHDC1 proteins produced from the normal copy of the gene. Some people with Xia-Gibbs syndrome have a mutation that removes (deletes) the AHDC1 gene (and other nearby genes), although it is unclear if such mutations cause the condition.Researchers suspect that a reduction in the amount of functional AHDC1 protein prevents normal brain development, leading to intellectual disability, speech problems, and other neurological features of Xia-Gibbs syndrome. Abnormal development of other body systems caused by a shortage of AHDC1 protein may account for additional signs and symptoms of the condition. "
66,AIP ,aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein,"The AIP gene provides instructions for making a protein called aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP). Although AIP's function is not well understood, it is known to interact with numerous other proteins, including one called the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Through these interactions, AIP likely helps regulate certain cell processes, such as the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and cell survival. This protein is thought to act as a tumor suppressor, which means it normally helps prevent cells from proliferating in an uncontrolled way.","Familial isolated pituitary adenoma Mutations in the AIP gene cause 15 to 25 percent of cases of familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA), an inherited condition characterized by development of a noncancerous tumor in the pituitary gland (called a pituitary adenoma). This small gland at the base of the brain produces hormones that control many important body functions. There are several types of pituitary adenomas categorized by the hormone they produce. Affected individuals within the same family may develop the same type of pituitary adenoma or different types. People with a mutation in the AIP gene most commonly develop a type of pituitary adenoma called a somatotropinoma. FIPA tumors caused by AIP gene mutations usually occur at a younger age and are larger than those without AIP gene mutations.Many kinds of mutations in the AIP gene have been identified in affected families. Some of these changes lead to an abnormally short protein or no protein at all. Other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in AIP. Although it is unclear how these mutations are involved in tumor development, researchers believe that the alterations disrupt interaction between AIP and one or more other proteins. The ability of AIP to control cell proliferation may be reduced, allowing pituitary cells to grow and divide unchecked and form a tumor. It is not known why the pituitary gland is specifically affected or why certain types of pituitary adenomas develop.Even before FIPA was defined as a condition, doctors recognized that somatotropinomas could occur in multiple members of a family. They referred to these tumors as isolated familial somatotropinoma. These tumors produce and release excess growth hormone (also called somatotropin), which promotes growth of the body. Because it can cause overgrowth of the hands, feet, and face (acromegaly), the condition is also referred to as familial isolated acromegaly. Later, researchers discovered that isolated familial somatotropinoma can be caused by mutations in the AIP gene, and these tumors are now considered part of FIPA. "
67,AIRE ,autoimmune regulator,"The AIRE gene provides instructions for making a protein called the autoimmune regulator. This protein is active primarily in the thymus, which is an organ located behind the breastbone that plays an important role in immune system function. The thymus prepares immune cells called T cells for their role in fighting infection; this process is called thymic education.For a person to remain healthy, immune system cells such as T cells must be able to identify and destroy potentially harmful invaders (such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses) while sparing the body's normal tissues. The autoimmune regulator protein plays an important role in this process by helping T cells distinguish the body's own proteins from those of foreign invaders. When this system malfunctions, the immune system's ability to distinguish between the body's proteins and foreign invaders is impaired, and it may attack the body's own tissues and organs. This abnormal reaction is called autoimmunity. In the thymus, the autoimmune regulator protein destroys T cells that otherwise would cause autoimmune damage.","Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy More than 90 mutations in the AIRE gene have been identified in people with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED). APECED is an inherited condition that affects many of the body's organs. A major feature of this disorder is chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), which is a tendency to develop infections of the skin, the nails, and the moist lining of body cavities (mucous membranes) caused by a type of fungus called Candida. Other common signs and symptoms of APECED involve dysfunction of the body's network of hormone-producing glands (the endocrine system), as well as other organs and tissues.The AIRE gene mutations that cause APECED lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the autoimmune regulator protein or change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in critical regions of the protein. These mutations reduce or eliminate the function of the autoimmune regulator protein. Without enough of this protein function, the immune system's ability to distinguish between the body's proteins and foreign invaders is impaired, and immune cells may attack the body's own organs, resulting in autoimmunity. This abnormal reaction leads to inflammation and can damage otherwise healthy cells and tissues. Autoimmune damage to the adrenal glands, parathyroid glands, and other organs underlies many of the major features of APECED.Studies suggest that AIRE gene mutations also result in immune substances (antibodies) mistakenly attacking proteins involved in an immune process called the IL-17 pathway, which is important in the body's defense against Candida. This pathway, which depends on specialized proteins called IL-17 cytokines for signaling, creates inflammation, sending additional cytokines and white blood cells to fight foreign invaders and promote tissue repair. In addition, the IL-17 pathway promotes the production of certain antimicrobial protein segments (peptides) that control growth of Candida on the surface of mucous membranes. By damaging IL-17 cytokines, AIRE gene mutations are thought to impair the IL-17 pathway's function, resulting in CMC in people with APECED. "
68,AKR1D1 ,aldo-keto reductase family 1 member D1,"The AKR1D1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 3-oxo-5-beta(β)-steroid 4-dehydrogenase. This enzyme is found in liver cells. It participates in the production of bile acids, which are a component of a digestive fluid called bile. Bile acids stimulate bile flow and helps absorb fats and fat-soluble vitamins. Bile acids are produced from cholesterol in a multi-step process. The 3-oxo-5-β-steroid 4-dehydrogenase enzyme is responsible for the third step in that process, which converts 7alpha(α)-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one to 7α-hydroxy-5β-cholesten-3-one.","Congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 2 More than 10 mutations in the AKR1D1 gene have been found to cause congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 2. This condition is characterized by cholestasis, a condition that impairs the production and release of a digestive fluid called bile from liver cells. Most of the AKR1D1 gene mutations replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the enzyme. These mutations result in production of a 3-oxo-5-β-steroid 4-dehydrogenase enzyme with severely reduced function. Without enough functional enzyme, the conversion of 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one to 7α-hydroxy-5β-cholesten-3-one is impaired. The 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one instead gets converted into abnormal bile acid compounds that cannot be transported out of the liver into the intestine, where the bile acids are needed to digest fats. This impaired production and release of bile acids leads to cholestasis. As a result, cholesterol and abnormal bile acids build up in the liver and fat-soluble vitamins are not absorbed, leading to the signs and symptoms of congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 2. "
69,AKT1 ,AKT serine/threonine kinase 1,"The AKT1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called AKT1 kinase. This protein is found in various cell types throughout the body, where it plays a critical role in many signaling pathways. For example, AKT1 kinase helps regulate cell growth and division (proliferation), the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and cell survival. AKT1 kinase also helps control apoptosis, which is the self-destruction of cells when they become damaged or are no longer needed.Signaling involving AKT1 kinase appears to be essential for the normal development and function of the nervous system. Studies have suggested a role for AKT1 kinase in cell-to-cell communication among nerve cells (neurons), neuronal survival, and the formation of memories.The AKT1 gene belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous.","Proteus syndrome At least one mutation in the AKT1 gene has been found to cause Proteus syndrome, a rare condition characterized by overgrowth of the bones, skin, and other tissues. This mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in AKT1 kinase. Specifically, it replaces the amino acid glutamic acid with the amino acid lysine at protein position 17 (written as Glu17Lys or E17K). The mutation is not inherited from a parent; in people with Proteus syndrome, the mutation arises randomly in one cell during the early stages of development before birth. As cells continue to grow and divide, some cells will have the mutation and other cells will not. This mixture of cells with and without a genetic mutation is known as mosaicism.The Glu17Lys mutation leads to the production of an overactive AKT1 kinase that is turned on when it should not be. The abnormally active protein disrupts a cell's ability to regulate its own growth, allowing the cell to grow and divide abnormally. Increased cell proliferation in various tissues and organs leads to the overgrowth characteristic of Proteus syndrome. Studies suggest that the AKT1 gene mutation is more common in groups of cells that experience overgrowth than in the parts of the body that grow normally. "
70,AKT3 ,AKT serine/threonine kinase 3,"The AKT3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is most active in the nervous system. The AKT3 protein is a key regulator of a chemical signaling pathway called the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. This signaling influences many critical cell functions, including the creation (synthesis) of new proteins, cell growth and division (proliferation), and the survival of cells. The PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is essential for the normal development of many parts of the body, including the brain. Studies suggest that the AKT3 protein plays a critical role in determining brain size.","Megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome Several mutations in the AKT3 gene have been found to cause megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndrome. This rare condition affects the development of the brain, causing an unusually large brain and head size (megalencephaly) and other abnormalities of the brain's structure.Each of the known mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the AKT3 protein. These changes are described as ""gain-of-function"" because they increase the activity of the protein. This enhanced activity increases chemical signaling through the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, which causes excessive cell growth and division. The increased number of cells leads to rapid and abnormal brain growth starting before birth. "
71,ALAD ,aminolevulinate dehydratase,"The ALAD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme known as delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase. This enzyme is involved in the production of a molecule called heme. Heme is vital for all of the body's organs, although it is found mostly in the blood, bone marrow, and liver. Heme is an essential component of several iron-containing proteins called hemoproteins, including hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in the blood).The production of heme is a multi-step process that requires eight different enzymes. Delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase is responsible for the second step in this process, which combines two molecules of delta-aminolevulinic acid (the product of the first step) to form a compound called porphobilinogen. In subsequent steps, four molecules of porphobilinogen are combined and then modified to produce heme.","Porphyria At least 10 mutations in the ALAD gene can cause a rare form of porphyria called ALAD deficiency porphyria. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase. These changes reduce the activity of the enzyme, allowing delta-aminolevulinic acid to build up to toxic levels in the body. This compound is formed during the normal process of heme production, but reduced activity of delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase allows it to accumulate to toxic levels. Very high levels of this compound can cause attacks of abdominal pain, vomiting, and other signs and symptoms of ALAD deficiency porphyria. "
72,ALAS2 ,5'-aminolevulinate synthase 2,"The ALAS2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 5'-aminolevulinate synthase 2 or erythroid ALA-synthase. This version of the enzyme is found only in developing red blood cells called erythroblasts.ALA-synthase plays an important role in the production of heme. Heme is a component of iron-containing proteins called hemoproteins, including hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in the blood). Heme is vital for all of the body's organs, although it is most abundant in the blood, bone marrow, and liver.The production of heme is a multi-step process that requires eight different enzymes. ALA-synthase is responsible for the first step in this process, the formation of a compound called delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). In subsequent steps, seven other enzymes produce and modify compounds that ultimately lead to heme.","Porphyria At least two ALAS2 gene mutations have been found in people with a form of porphyria known as X-linked dominant erythropoietic protoporphyria. Each of these mutations deletes a small amount of genetic material near the end of the ALAS2 gene. These changes overactivate erythroid ALA-synthase, which increases the production of ALA within red blood cells. The excess ALA is converted by other enzymes to compounds called porphyrins. If these compounds build up in erythroblasts, they can leak out and be transported through the bloodstream to the skin and other tissues. High levels of porphyrins in the skin cause the oversensitivity to sunlight that is characteristic of this condition. "
73,ALDH3A2 ,aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family member A2,"The ALDH3A2 gene is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) gene family. Genes in this family provide instructions for producing enzymes that alter molecules called aldehydes. The ALDH3A2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH). This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of fats, specifically the breakdown of molecules called fatty aldehydes to fatty acids. This conversion of molecules is part of a multistep process called fatty acid oxidation in which fats are broken down and converted into energy.The FALDH enzyme is found in most tissues, but its activity (expression) is highest in the liver. Within cells, the FALDH enzyme is located in the endoplasmic reticulum, a structure involved in protein processing and transport.","Sjögren-Larsson syndrome At least 80 mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene have been found to cause Sjögren-Larsson syndrome, a condition characterized by dry, scaly skin (ichthyosis); neurological abnormalities; and eye problems. Many of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the FALDH enzyme. The gene mutations that cause Sjögren-Larsson syndrome lead to the production of a FALDH enzyme that is unable to break down fatty aldehyde molecules. As a result, fats that are not broken down can build up in cells. In all affected tissues, excess fat accumulation interferes with the normal formation of protective membranes or materials that are necessary for the body to function normally. These abnormalities underlie the characteristic signs and symptoms of Sjögren-Larsson syndrome. "
74,ALDH4A1 ,aldehyde dehydrogenase 4 family member A1,"The ALDH4A1 gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase, which is found in tissues throughout the body. Within the cells of these tissues, this enzyme functions in energy-producing structures called mitochondria.Pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase starts the second step in the process that breaks down the protein building block (amino acid) proline. This step converts pyrroline-5-carboxylate, which is produced in the first step, to the amino acid glutamate. The conversion between proline and glutamate is important in maintaining a supply of the amino acids needed for protein production, and for energy transfer within the cell.","Hyperprolinemia Researchers have identified three mutations in the ALDH4A1 gene that eliminate the function of the pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase enzyme, causing hyperprolinemia type II. Two of these mutations add or delete a DNA building block (nucleotide), which introduces a premature stop signal that results in an abnormally shortened enzyme. The third mutation results in the substitution of the amino acid leucine for the amino acid serine at position 352 (written as Ser352Leu or S352L) in the pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase enzyme. Nonfunctional pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase leads to elevated levels of proline and a buildup of the intermediate breakdown product pyrroline-5-carboxylate, causing the signs and symptoms of hyperprolinemia type II. "
75,ALDH5A1 ,aldehyde dehydrogenase 5 family member A1,"The ALDH5A1 gene provides instructions for producing the succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase enzyme. This enzyme is found in the energy-producing centers of cells (mitochondria). Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase is involved in the breakdown of a chemical that transmits signals in the brain (neurotransmitter) called gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA). The primary role of GABA is to prevent the brain from being overloaded with too many signals. Once GABA molecules have been released from nerve cells, they are broken down by succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase and other enzymes.","Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency At least 35 mutations in the ALDH5A1 gene have been found to cause succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency. Most of these mutations change one protein building block (amino acid) in the succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase enzyme. Mutations in the ALDH5A1 gene lead to the production of an enzyme with little or no activity. A lack of functional succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase disrupts the conversion of succinic semialdehyde to succinic acid. Instead, succinic semialdehyde is converted back into GABA or to a related molecule, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). It is unclear how increases in GHB and GABA cause developmental delay, seizures, and other features of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency. "
76,ALDH7A1 ,aldehyde dehydrogenase 7 family member A1,"The ALDH7A1 gene is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) gene family. These genes provide instructions for producing enzymes that alter molecules called aldehydes. The ALDH7A1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called α-aminoadipic semialdehyde (α-AASA) dehydrogenase, also known as antiquitin. Within the cell, antiquitin is found in the internal fluid of the cell (cytosol) and in the nucleus. This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of the protein building block (amino acid) lysine in the brain. In one step in the breakdown of lysine to other molecules, antiquitin facilitates the conversion of α-aminoadipic semialdehyde to α-aminoadipate. The breakdown of lysine in the brain is necessary for energy production and to produce other needed molecules.","Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy A variety of mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene have been found to cause pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy. Most of these mutations are specific to single families. One mutation occurs in multiple people with this condition; it replaces the amino acid glutamine with the amino acid glycine at position 399 in the antiquitin protein (written as Glu399Gln or E399Q). All mutations that cause pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy produce a nonfunctional antiquitin protein. A shortage (deficiency) of antiquitin leads to the buildup of α-aminoadipic semialdehyde, resulting in a disruption in the activity of pyridoxine, a form of vitamin B6 derived from food. Pyridoxine plays a role many processes in the body, such as the breakdown of amino acids and chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters. It is unclear how a lack of pyridoxine causes the seizures characteristic of this condition. "
77,ALDOB ,"aldolase, fructose-bisphosphate B","The ALDOB gene provides instructions for making the aldolase B enzyme. This enzyme is one of a group of three aldolase enzymes that are responsible for breaking down certain molecules in cells throughout the body. Four identical aldolase B enzymes need to be attached (bound) to each other in a four-enzyme unit called a tetramer to work.Aldolase B is found primarily in the liver, but it is also present at lower levels in kidney and intestinal cells. Aldolase B is involved in the breakdown (metabolism) of the simple sugar fructose, which is found mostly in fruits and is used in the body for energy. Aldolase B is responsible for the second step in the metabolism of fructose, which breaks down the molecule fructose-1-phosphate into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. To a lesser degree, aldolase B is also involved in the breakdown of the simple sugar glucose.","Hereditary fructose intolerance More than 50 mutations in the ALDOB gene have been found to cause hereditary fructose intolerance, a condition characterized by nausea and intestinal discomfort following ingestion of foods containing fructose. Most of these mutations replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the aldolase B enzyme and result in the production of an enzyme with reduced function. A mutation found in approximately half of people with hereditary fructose intolerance replaces the amino acid alanine with the amino acid proline at position 149 in the enzyme (written as Ala149Pro or A149P). This mutation alters the 3-dimensional shape of the enzyme. Alteration of the shape of the enzyme makes it difficult for the aldolase B enzymes to bind together and form tetramers. If it is not in a tetramer, aldolase B cannot metabolize fructose.A lack of functional aldolase B results in an accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate in liver cells. This buildup is toxic, resulting in the death of liver cells over time. Additionally, the breakdown products of fructose-1-phosphase are needed in the body to produce energy and to maintain blood sugar levels. The combination of decreased cellular energy, low blood sugar, and liver cell death leads to the features of hereditary fructose intolerance. "
78,ALG1 ,"ALG1, chitobiosyldiphosphodolichol beta-mannosyltransferase","The ALG1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is involved in a process called glycosylation. During this process, complex chains of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) are attached to proteins and fats (lipids). Glycosylation modifies proteins so they can fully perform their functions and modifies lipids so they can help cells interact with each other. Oligosaccharides are made up of many sugar molecules that are attached to one another in a stepwise process, forming a complex chain. The enzyme produced from the ALG1 gene transfers a simple sugar called mannose to growing oligosaccharides at a particular step in the formation of the chain. Once the correct number of sugar molecules are linked together, the oligosaccharide is attached to a protein or lipid.","ALG1-congenital disorder of glycosylation At least 15 mutations in the ALG1 gene have been found to cause ALG1-congenital disorder of glycosylation (ALG1-CDG). This condition typically leads to intellectual disability, delayed development, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and other signs and symptoms that affect many body systems. Mutations in the ALG1 gene result in the production of an abnormal enzyme with little activity. The poorly functioning enzyme cannot add mannose to sugar chains efficiently, and the resulting oligosaccharides are often incomplete. Although the short oligosaccharides can be transferred to proteins and lipids, the process is not as efficient as with the full-length oligosaccharide. The wide variety of signs and symptoms in ALG1-CDG are likely due to impaired glycosylation of proteins and lipids that are needed for normal function of many organs and tissues. "
79,ALG6 ,"ALG6, alpha-1,3-glucosyltransferase","The ALG6 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is involved in a process called glycosylation. Glycosylation is a process by which sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) are attached to proteins and fats. Oligosaccharides are made up of many sugar molecules that are attached to one another in a stepwise process forming a complex chain. Glycosylation modifies proteins so they can perform a wider variety of functions. The enzyme produced from the ALG6 gene transfers a simple sugar called glucose to the growing oligosaccharide. Once the correct number of sugar molecules are linked together, the oligosaccharide is attached to a protein or fat.","ALG6-congenital disorder of glycosylation At least 20 mutations in the ALG6 gene have been found to cause ALG6-congenital disorder of glycosylation (ALG6-CDG, also known as congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ic). This condition typically leads to developmental delay, vision problems, seizures, and other signs and symptoms. Mutations in the ALG6 gene result in the production of an abnormal enzyme with reduced or no activity. A common mutation replaces the protein building block (amino acid) alanine with the amino acid valine at position 333 in the enzyme. This mutation, written as Ala333Val or A333V, results in an enzyme with reduced activity. Without a properly functioning enzyme, glycosylation cannot proceed normally, and oligosaccharides are incomplete. As a result, glycosylation is reduced or absent. The wide variety of signs and symptoms in ALG6-CDG are likely due to impaired glycosylation of proteins and fats that are needed for normal function in many organs and tissues, including the brain, eyes, and hormone-producing (endocrine) system. "
80,ALG12 ,"ALG12, alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase","The ALG12 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is involved in a process called glycosylation. During this process, complex chains of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) are attached to proteins and fats (lipids). Glycosylation modifies proteins so they can fully perform their functions. Oligosaccharides are made up of many sugar molecules that are attached to one another in a stepwise process, forming a complex chain. The enzyme produced from the ALG12 gene transfers a simple sugar called mannose to growing oligosaccharides at a particular step in the formation of the chain. Once the correct number of sugar molecules are linked together, the oligosaccharide is attached to a protein or lipid.","ALG12-congenital disorder of glycosylation At least 13 mutations in the ALG12 gene have been found to cause ALG12-congenital disorder of glycosylation (ALG12-CDG). This condition typically leads to delayed growth and development, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and other signs and symptoms. Mutations in the ALG12 gene result in the production of an abnormal enzyme with little activity. Without a properly functioning enzyme, mannose cannot be added to the chain efficiently, and the resulting oligosaccharides are often incomplete. Although the short oligosaccharides can be transferred to proteins and lipids, the process is not as efficient as with the full-length oligosaccharide. As a result, glycosylation is reduced. The wide variety of signs and symptoms in ALG12-CDG are likely due to impaired glycosylation of proteins and lipids that are needed for normal function in many organs and tissues, including the brain. "
81,ALK ,ALK receptor tyrosine kinase,"The ALK gene provides instructions for making a protein called ALK receptor tyrosine kinase, which is part of a family of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Receptor tyrosine kinases transmit signals from the cell surface into the cell through a process called signal transduction. The process begins when the kinase is stimulated at the cell surface and then attaches to a similar kinase (dimerizes). After dimerization, the kinase is tagged with a marker called a phosphate group (a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms) in a process called phosphorylation. Phosphorylation turns on (activates) the kinase. The activated kinase is able to transfer a phosphate group to another protein inside the cell, which is activated as a result. The activation continues through a series of proteins in a signaling pathway. These signaling pathways are important in many cellular processes such as cell growth and division (proliferation) or maturation (differentiation).Although the specific function of ALK receptor tyrosine kinase is unknown, it is thought to act early in development to help regulate the proliferation of nerve cells.","Neuroblastoma At least 16 mutations in the ALK gene have been identified in some people with neuroblastoma, a type of cancerous tumor composed of immature nerve cells (neuroblasts). Neuroblastoma and other cancers occur when a buildup of genetic mutations in critical genes—those that control cell proliferation or differentiation—allows cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In most cases, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are called somatic mutations. Somatic mutations are present only in certain cells and are not inherited. Less commonly, gene mutations that increase the risk of developing cancer can be inherited from a parent. Both types of mutation occur in neuroblastoma. Somatic mutations in the ALK gene occur during the development of some cases of sporadic neuroblastoma, and inherited mutations in the ALK gene increase the risk of developing familial neuroblastoma.Mutations in the ALK gene change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in ALK receptor tyrosine kinase. The most common mutation in neuroblastoma replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid glutamine at position 1275 (written as Arg1275Gln or R1275Q). Arg1275Gln has been found in both familial and sporadic neuroblastoma and is the only common ALK gene mutation that has been found in both types of the condition.Occasionally, extra copies of the ALK gene are found in people with neuroblastoma. This phenomenon, known as gene amplification, results in overexpression of ALK receptor tyrosine kinase.Mutated or overexpressed ALK receptor tyrosine kinase no longer requires stimulation from outside the cell to be phosphorylated. As a result, the kinase and the downstream signaling pathway are constantly turned on (constitutively activated). Constitutive activation of ALK receptor tyrosine kinase may increase the proliferation of immature nerve cells, leading to neuroblastoma. "
82,ALMS1 ,"ALMS1, centrosome and basal body associated protein","The ALMS1 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. Researchers believe that the protein may play a role in hearing, vision, regulation of body weight, and functions of the heart, kidney, lungs, and liver. It may also affect how the pancreas regulates insulin, a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels.The ALMS1 protein is present in most of the body's tissues, usually at low levels. Within cells, this protein is located in structures called centrosomes. Centrosomes play a role in cell division and the assembly of microtubules, which are proteins that transport materials in cells and help the cell maintain its shape. The ALMS1 protein is also found at the base of cilia, which are finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. Almost all cells have cilia at some stage of their life cycle. Cilia are involved in cell movement and many different chemical signaling pathways. Based on its location within cells, researchers suggest that the ALMS1 protein might be involved in the organization of microtubules, the transport of various materials, and the normal function of cilia.","Alström syndrome More than 80 mutations in the ALMS1 gene have been identified in people with Alström syndrome. Most of these mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small version of the ALMS1 protein that does not function properly. Researchers propose that a lack of normally functioning ALMS1 protein in the brain could lead to overeating. A loss of this protein in the pancreas may cause insulin resistance, a condition in which the body cannot use insulin properly. The combined effects of overeating and insulin resistance impair the body's ability to handle excess sugar, leading to diabetes and obesity (two common features of Alström syndrome). It is unclear how ALMS1 mutations cause the other signs and symptoms of Alström syndrome. Researchers suspect that this condition is associated with malfunctioning cilia in many of the body's tissues and organs. "
83,ALOX12B ,"arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase, 12R type","The ALOX12B gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 12R-LOX. This enzyme is part of a family of enzymes called arachidonate lipoxygenases. Most of these enzymes help add an oxygen molecule to a particular fatty acid called arachidonic acid. Arachidonate lipoxygenases add oxygen molecules at different locations on the arachidonic acid molecule, producing a variety of substances called fatty acid hydroperoxides. The fatty acid hydroperoxides are then processed into molecules that play an important role in chemical signaling within cells.Specifically, the 12R-LOX enzyme helps add an oxygen molecule to arachidonic acid to make a substance called 12R-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12R-HPETE). 12R-HPETE is later converted to a signaling molecule that is involved in the formation of the layers of fats (lipids) within the outermost layer of the skin (the epidermis). The lipid layers are necessary to prevent water loss (dehydration) through the skin.","Nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma More than 55 mutations in the ALOX12B gene have been found to cause nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NBCIE). This condition affects the skin and causes redness; the development of fine, white scales; an increased risk of infections; and excessive dehydration. Most of the mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the 12R-LOX enzyme. Many ALOX12B gene mutations lead to the production of a nonfunctional 12R-LOX enzyme, which disrupts the processing of the molecules involved in the formation of the lipid layer within the epidermis. Problems with this protective barrier underlie the skin abnormalities and other features of NBCIE. "
84,ALOXE3 ,arachidonate lipoxygenase 3,"The ALOXE3 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called eLOX3. This enzyme is part of a family of enzymes called arachidonate lipoxygenases. Most enzymes in this family help add an oxygen molecule to certain fatty acids to produce substances called fatty acid hydroperoxides.Unlike other lipoxygenases, the eLOX3 enzyme does not act directly on fatty acids. Instead, it is involved in the step following the creation of fatty acid hydroperoxides. The eLOX3 enzyme processes fatty acid hydroperoxides, which are later converted to signaling molecules that are involved in the formation of the layers of fats (lipids) within the outermost layer of the skin (the epidermis). The lipid layers are necessary to prevent water loss (dehydration) through the skin.","Nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma At least 20 mutations in the ALOXE3 gene have been found to cause nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NBCIE). This condition affects the skin and causes redness; the development of fine, white scales; an increased risk of infections; and excessive dehydration. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the eLOX3 enzyme. Many ALOXE3 gene mutations lead to the production of a nonfunctional eLOX3 enzyme, which disrupts the processing of the molecules involved in the formation of the lipid layers within the epidermis. Problems with this protective barrier underlie the skin abnormalities and other features of NBCIE. "
85,ALPL ,"alkaline phosphatase, biomineralization associated","The ALPL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). This enzyme plays an important role in the growth and development of bones and teeth. It is also active in many other tissues, particularly in the liver and kidneys. This enzyme acts as a phosphatase, which means that it removes clusters of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (phosphate groups) from other molecules.TNSALP is essential for the process of mineralization, in which minerals such as calcium and phosphorus are deposited in developing bones and teeth. Mineralization is critical for the formation of bones that are strong and rigid and teeth that can withstand chewing and grinding.","Hypophosphatasia About 300 mutations in the ALPL gene have been identified in people with hypophosphatasia. Most of these mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in TNSALP. Other mutations insert or delete genetic material in the ALPL gene or change the way the gene's instructions are used to build the enzyme.Mutations in the ALPL gene lead to the production of an abnormal version of TNSALP that cannot participate effectively in the mineralization of developing bones and teeth. A shortage of functional TNSALP allows substances that are normally processed by the enzyme to build up in the body. Researchers believe that a buildup of one of these compounds, inorganic pyrophosphate, underlies the defective mineralization of bones and teeth in people with hypophosphatasia.ALPL mutations that almost completely eliminate the activity of TNSALP usually result in the more severe forms of hypophosphatasia. Other mutations, which reduce but do not eliminate the activity of the enzyme, are often responsible for milder forms of the condition. "
86,ALS2 ,"ALS2, alsin Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor","The ALS2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called alsin. Alsin is produced in a wide range of tissues, with highest amounts in the brain. This protein is particularly abundant in motor neurons, the specialized nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control the movement of muscles.Alsin turns on (activates) multiple proteins called GTPases that convert a molecule called GTP into another molecule called GDP. GTPases play important roles in cell division, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). The GTPases play important roles in several cell processes. The GTPases that are activated by alsin are involved in the proper placement of the various proteins and fats that make up the cell membrane, the transport of molecules from the cell membrane to the interior of the cell (endocytosis), and the development of specialized structures called axons and dendrites that project from neurons and are essential for the transmission of nerve impulses.",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Genetics Home Reference provides information about amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 
87,ALX1 ,ALX homeobox 1,"The ALX1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is a member of the homeobox protein family. Homeobox proteins direct the formation of body structures during early embryonic development. The ALX1 protein is necessary for normal development of the head and face, particularly the formation of the eyes, nose, and mouth, which begins around the fourth week of development. The ALX1 protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to DNA and controls the activity of certain genes. Specifically, the protein controls the activity of genes that regulate cell growth and division (proliferation) and movement (migration), ensuring that cells grow and stop growing at specific times and that they are positioned correctly during development.","Frontonasal dysplasia At least three mutations in the ALX1 gene have been found to cause frontonasal dysplasia. ALX1 gene mutations cause a form of the disorder called frontonasal dysplasia type 3, which is characterized by severe malformations of the structures at the center of the face. ALX1 gene mutations that cause this condition alter the protein's structure and impair its ability to bind to DNA and regulate gene function. As a result, the proliferation and migration of cells during development is not controlled, which can lead to small or missing eyes, openings (clefts) in the nose or mouth, and other severe facial malformations characteristic of frontonasal dysplasia type 3. "
88,ALX3 ,ALX homeobox 3,"The ALX3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is a member of the homeobox protein family. Homeobox proteins direct the formation of body structures during early embryonic development. The ALX3 protein is necessary for normal development of the head and face, particularly the formation of the nose, which begins around the fourth week of development. The ALX3 protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to DNA and controls the activity of certain genes. Specifically, the protein controls the activity of genes that regulate cell growth and division (proliferation) and movement (migration), ensuring that cells grow and stop growing at specific times and that they are positioned correctly during development.","Frontonasal dysplasia At least seven mutations in the ALX3 gene have been found to cause frontonasal dysplasia. ALX3 gene mutations cause a form of the disorder called frontonasal dysplasia type 1, which particularly affects the development of the nose and surrounding tissues. ALX3 gene mutations that cause this condition severely reduce or eliminate the function of the ALX3 protein. As a result, the protein cannot bind to DNA and regulate gene function, which leads to poorly controlled cell proliferation and migration during development. This abnormal cell growth and movement impairs development of structures in the middle of the face, particularly the nose, leading to openings (clefts) in the nose. This abnormal development can also interfere with the proper formation of the skull, leading to the skull malformations typical of frontonasal dysplasia type 1. "
89,ALX4 ,ALX homeobox 4,"The ALX4 gene provides instructions for making a member of the homeobox protein family. Homeobox proteins direct the formation of body structures during early embryonic development. The ALX4 protein is necessary for normal development of the skull and formation of the head and face, which begins early in fetal development. This protein is also involved in the formation of skin layers, but its role in this process is poorly understood.The ALX4 protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to DNA and controls the activity of certain genes. Specifically, the protein controls the activity of genes that regulate cell growth and division (proliferation), cell maturation and specialization (differentiation), cell movement (migration), and cell survival. The regulation of these functions ensures that cells start and stop growing at specific times and that they are positioned correctly during development.","Enlarged parietal foramina At least eight mutations in the ALX4 gene have been found to cause enlarged parietal foramina type 2. This condition is characterized by enlarged openings (foramina) in the parietal bones, which are the two bones that form the top and sides of the skull. Openings in the parietal bones are normal during fetal development, but they usually close before birth. In people with this condition, the parietal foramina remain open throughout life.The mutations that cause enlarged parietal foramina result in the production of an ALX4 protein that cannot bind to DNA, which alters the regulation of multiple genes. As a result, several cell processes are disrupted, including proliferation, differentiation, and survival. In early development, the skull seems to be particularly sensitive to changes in ALX4 protein activity. Specifically, cells in the skull that are involved in bone formation (ossification) cannot function normally, leading to a lack of bone in areas of the skull and resulting in enlarged parietal foramina. "
90,AMACR ,alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase,"The AMACR gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR). This enzyme is found in the energy-producing centers in cells (mitochondria) and in cell structures called peroxisomes. Peroxisomes contain a variety of enzymes that break down many different substances, including fatty acids and certain toxic compounds. They are also important for the production (synthesis) of fats (lipids) used in digestion and in the nervous system.In peroxisomes, the AMACR enzyme plays a role in the breakdown of a fatty acid called pristanic acid, which comes from meat and dairy foods in the diet. In mitochondria, AMACR is thought to help further break down the molecules derived from pristanic acid.","Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase deficiency Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) deficiency is caused by mutations in the AMACR gene. This disorder leads to a variety of neurological problems that begin in adulthood, including gradual loss in intellectual functioning (cognitive decline), seizures, and weakness and loss of sensation in the limbs due to nerve damage (sensorimotor neuropathy). Most individuals with AMACR deficiency have an AMACR gene mutation that replaces a protein building block (amino acid) called serine with an amino acid called proline at position 52 in the enzyme sequence, written as Ser52Pro or S52P. This mutation results in a lack (deficiency) of functional enzyme. The enzyme deficiency leads to accumulation of pristanic acid in the blood. However, it is unclear how this accumulation is related to the specific signs and symptoms of AMACR deficiency. "
91,AMELX ,amelogenin X-linked,"The AMELX gene provides instructions for making a protein called amelogenin, which is essential for normal tooth development. Amelogenin is involved in the formation of enamel, which is the hard, white material that forms the protective outer layer of each tooth. Enamel is composed mainly of mineral crystals. These microscopic crystals are arranged in organized bundles that give enamel its strength and durability. Although the exact function of amelogenin is not well understood, it appears to separate and support the crystals as they grow. Amelogenin is removed from the developing crystals when it is no longer needed, leaving mature enamel that contains very little protein.One copy of the amelogenin gene is located on each of the sex chromosomes (the X and Y chromosomes). The AMELX gene, which is located on the X chromosome, makes almost all of the body's amelogenin. The copy of the amelogenin gene on the Y chromosome, AMELY, makes very little amelogenin and is not needed for enamel formation.",Amelogenesis imperfecta At least 23 mutations in the AMELX gene have been identified in people with an X-linked form of a disorder of tooth development called amelogenesis imperfecta. (X-linked disorders are caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome.) Some AMELX gene mutations lead to the production of an abnormal version of the amelogenin protein that can interfere with the formation and organization of enamel crystals. Other AMELX gene mutations prevent one copy of the gene from producing any amelogenin protein at all. Enamel cannot form properly without an adequate amount of amelogenin.Males have a single copy of the X chromosome in each cell. Males who inherit an altered copy of the AMELX gene have very little amelogenin and develop almost no enamel to cover and protect their teeth. (The normal AMELY gene on the Y chromosome does not provide enough amelogenin to compensate.) Females have two copies of the X chromosome in each cell. Females who inherit one altered copy of the AMELX gene are less severely affected than males because they have a normal copy of the gene on the other X chromosome to produce amelogenin. Their tooth enamel may have structural defects such as a distinctive pattern of vertical grooves. 
92,AMER1 ,APC membrane recruitment protein 1,"The AMER1 gene provides instructions for making a protein found in tissues throughout the body where it helps regulate the Wnt signaling pathway, which is a series of chemical signals that affect the way cells and tissues develop. Wnt signaling is important for cell division, attachment of cells to one another (adhesion), cell movement (migration), and many other cell activities. The AMER1 protein can promote cell growth by helping to turn on (activate) the Wnt pathway or prevent cell growth by helping to turn off (repress) the Wnt pathway. When repressing the pathway, the AMER1 protein is acting as a tumor suppressor, which means that it helps prevent cells from growing and dividing (proliferating) too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.","Wilms tumor Mutations in the AMER1 gene have been found in Wilms tumor, a rare form of kidney cancer that occurs almost exclusively in children. These mutations are somatic, meaning that they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in kidney cells that give rise to the tumor. AMER1 gene mutations result in a protein with a reduced ability to repress Wnt signaling. As a result, Wnt signaling is increased, which leads to the unchecked proliferation of kidney cells and tumor development. "
93,AMH ,anti-Mullerian hormone,"The AMH gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in male sex differentiation. During development of male fetuses, the AMH protein is produced and released (secreted) by cells of the testes. The secreted protein attaches (binds) to its receptor, which is found on the surface of Müllerian duct cells. The Müllerian duct, found in both male and female fetuses, is the precursor to the female reproductive organs. Binding of the AMH protein to its receptor induces self-destruction (apoptosis) of the Müllerian duct cells. As a result, the Müllerian duct breaks down (regresses) in males. In females, who do not produce the AMH protein during fetal development, the Müllerian duct becomes the uterus and fallopian tubes.","Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome type 1, a disorder of sexual development that affects males, is caused by mutations in the AMH gene. Males with this condition have female reproductive organs in addition to normal male reproductive organs. At least 38 mutations in the AMH gene have been identified in people with persistent Müllerian duct syndrome type 1. Most mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the AMH protein. Other mutations result in a premature stop signal that leads to an abnormally short protein. Still other mutations delete regions of DNA from the AMH gene, which changes the instructions for the protein.The mutated AMH protein cannot be released from the cells of the testes or cannot bind to the receptor on the Müllerian duct cells. As a result, the Müllerian duct cells never receive the signal for apoptosis. The Müllerian duct persists and becomes a uterus and fallopian tubes. Because the AMH protein is not involved in the formation of male reproductive organs, affected males also have male reproductive organs. "
94,AMHR2 ,anti-Mullerian hormone receptor type 2,"The AMHR2 gene provides instructions for making the anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) receptor type 2, which is involved in male sex differentiation. The AMH receptor type 2 is found on the surface of Müllerian duct cells. The Müllerian duct, found in both male and female fetuses, is the precursor to the female reproductive organs. During development of male fetuses, cells of the testes release a protein called the AMH protein. The AMH protein attaches (binds) to the AMH receptor type 2, which signals self-destruction (apoptosis) of the Müllerian duct cells. As a result, the Müllerian duct breaks down (regresses) in males. In females, who do not produce the AMH protein during fetal development, the Müllerian duct becomes the uterus and fallopian tubes.","Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome type 2, a disorder of sexual development that affects males, is caused by mutations in the AMHR2 gene. Males with this condition have female reproductive organs in addition to normal male reproductive organs. At least 24 mutations in the AMHR2 gene have been identified in people with persistent Müllerian duct syndrome type 2. Most mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the AMH receptor type 2 protein. Other mutations result in a premature stop signal that leads to an abnormally short protein. Still other mutations delete regions of DNA from the AMHR2 gene, which changes the instructions for the protein. The most common mutation, a deletion of 27 DNA building blocks (nucleotides), occurs in about half of affected individuals with an AMHR2 gene mutation.Mutations in the AMHR2 gene lead to an abnormal protein that is stuck inside the Müllerian duct cells and not found on the surface. Therefore, the cells cannot receive the signal for apoptosis. As a result, the Müllerian duct persists and becomes a uterus and fallopian tubes. Because the AMH receptor type 2 is not involved in the formation of male reproductive organs, affected males also have male reproductive organs. "
95,AMN ,amnion associated transmembrane protein,"The AMN gene provides instructions for making a protein called amnionless. This protein is involved in the uptake of vitamin B12 (also called cobalamin) from food. Vitamin B12, which cannot be made in the body and can only be obtained from food, is essential for the formation of DNA and proteins, the production of cellular energy, and the breakdown of fats. This vitamin is involved in the formation of red blood cells and maintenance of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).The amnionless protein is primarily found embedded in the outer membrane of kidney cells and cells that line the small intestine. Amnionless attaches (binds) to another protein called cubilin, anchoring cubilin to the cell membrane. Cubilin can interact with molecules and proteins passing through the intestine or kidneys. During digestion, vitamin B12 is released from food. As the vitamin passes through the small intestine, cubilin binds to it. Amnionless helps transfer the cubilin-vitamin B12 complex into the intestinal cell. From there, the vitamin is released into the blood and transported throughout the body. In the kidneys, amnionless and cubilin are involved in the reabsorption of certain proteins that would otherwise be released in urine.","Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome At least 30 mutations in the AMN gene have been found to cause Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome. This condition is characterized by low levels of vitamin B12 in the body, which leads to a blood disorder known as megaloblastic anemia. About half of affected individuals also have excess protein in their urine (proteinuria), and some have neurological problems.AMN gene mutations that cause Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome reduce the amount or function of the amnionless protein. Without amnionless acting as an anchor, cubilin is not attached to cells in the small intestine or kidneys and cannot bind to vitamin B12 and other molecules and proteins needed in the body. As a result, instead of being taken into intestinal cells, vitamin B12 is released from the body. A shortage of this essential vitamin impairs the proper development of red blood cells, leading to megaloblastic anemia. Low levels of vitamin B12 can also affect the central nervous system, causing neurological problems. In addition, without amnionless function in the kidneys, proteins are not reabsorbed into the body and are instead released in the urine, leading to proteinuria. "
96,AMPD1 ,adenosine monophosphate deaminase 1,"The AMPD1 gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called adenosine monophosphate (AMP) deaminase. This enzyme is found in the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles), where it plays a role in producing energy. Specifically, during physical activity, this enzyme converts a molecule called adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to a molecule called inosine monophosphate (IMP) as part of a process called the purine nucleotide cycle. This cycle reuses molecules called purines, which are a group of building blocks of DNA (nucleotides), its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as AMP that serve as energy sources in the cell. As part of the purine nucleotide cycle, AMP deaminase converts AMP to IMP, and as the cycle continues, molecules are produced that the muscle cells can use for energy. Skeletal muscle cells need energy to function and move the body.","Adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency At least nine mutations in the AMPD1 gene have been found to cause AMP deaminase deficiency. This condition is characterized by skeletal muscle pain or weakness after exercise or prolonged physical activity (exercise intolerance). Most cases are caused by a mutation that results in a premature stop signal in the instructions for making AMP deaminase (written as Gly12Ter or Q12X). The resulting enzyme is abnormally short and nonfunctional and cannot participate in the purine nucleotide cycle. As a result, the process stalls and energy production in skeletal muscle cells is decreased. Skeletal muscles are particularly sensitive to decreases in energy during periods of exercise or increased activity when energy demands increase. The lack of AMP deaminase as a source of energy production can result in fatigue and muscle weakness or pain in some people with AMP deaminase deficiency.It is not known why some people with this condition do not experience symptoms. Researchers speculate that additional factors, both genetic and environmental, may determine whether a person develops the signs and symptoms of AMP deaminase deficiency. "
97,AMT ,aminomethyltransferase,"The AMT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aminomethyltransferase. This enzyme is one of four components (subunits) that make up a large complex called glycine cleavage enzyme. Within cells, this complex is active in specialized energy-producing centers called mitochondria.As its name suggests, glycine cleavage enzyme processes a molecule called glycine by cutting (cleaving) it into smaller pieces. Glycine is an amino acid, which is a building block of proteins. This molecule also acts as a neurotransmitter, which is a chemical messenger that transmits signals in the brain. The breakdown of excess glycine is necessary for the normal development and function of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.","Glycine encephalopathy Mutations in the AMT gene are responsible for 10 percent to 15 percent of all cases of glycine encephalopathy. More than a dozen mutations have been identified in affected individuals. Most of these genetic changes alter single amino acids in aminomethyltransferase. Other mutations delete genetic material from the AMT gene or disrupt how genetic information from the gene is spliced together to make a blueprint for producing aminomethyltransferase.AMT mutations alter the structure and function of aminomethyltransferase. When an altered version of this enzyme is incorporated into the glycine cleavage enzyme complex, it prevents the complex from breaking down glycine properly. As a result, excess glycine can build up to toxic levels in the body's organs and tissues. Damage caused by harmful amounts of this molecule in the brain and spinal cord is responsible for the intellectual disability, seizures, and breathing difficulties characteristic of glycine encephalopathy. "
98,ANK1 ,ankyrin 1,"The ANK1 gene provides instruction for making a protein called ankyrin-1. This protein is primarily active (expressed) in red blood cells, but it is also found in muscle and brain cells. In red blood cells, ankyrin-1 is located at the cell membrane, where it attaches (binds) to other membrane proteins. The binding of membrane proteins to one another maintains the stability and structure of red blood cells but also allows for their flexibility. The proteins allow the cell to change shape without breaking when passing through narrow blood vessels.In muscle and brain cells, ankyrin-1 performs similar functions, binding to other membrane proteins to play a role in cell stability, cell movement, and other cell functions.","Hereditary spherocytosis At least 55 mutations in the ANK1 gene have been found to cause hereditary spherocytosis. Some of these mutations delete small pieces of genetic material, and others change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the ANK1 gene. These mutations lead to the production of an ankyrin-1 protein that does not function normally and does not bind to other proteins within the red blood cell membrane. A lack of normal ankyrin-1 at the cell membrane also leads to a lack of another protein called spectrin because ankyrin-1 is not available to bind to spectrin. The shortage (deficiency) of these two proteins interferes with the structure and flexibility of the red blood cell membrane, causing red blood cells to be misshapen. These misshapen cells, called spherocytes, are removed from circulation and taken to the spleen for destruction. The shortage of red blood cells in circulation and the abundance of cells in the spleen are responsible for the signs and symptoms of hereditary spherocytosis. "
99,ANK2 ,ankyrin 2,"The ANK2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ankyrin-B. Ankyrin-B is part of a family of ankyrin proteins, which interact with many other types of proteins in cells throughout the body. Ankyrins help organize the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton) and link certain proteins that span the cell membrane to this framework. Additionally, ankyrins play key roles in important functions including cell movement (migration) and cell growth and division (proliferation).The ankyrin-B protein is active in many cell types, particularly in the brain and in heart (cardiac) muscle. This protein mainly interacts with ion channels and ion transporters, which are complexes of proteins that move charged atoms (ions) across cell membranes. In the heart, the flow of ions (such as sodium, potassium, and calcium) through ion channels and ion transporters generates the electrical signals that control the heartbeat and maintain a normal heart rhythm. Ankyrin-B ensures these channels and transporters are in their proper locations in the cell membrane so they can regulate the flow of ions into and out of cardiac muscle cells. In addition, ankyrin-B helps ensure that signaling molecules that regulate the activity of ion channels and ion transporters are in the proper location.","Ankyrin-B syndrome At least ten mutations in the ANK2 gene have been found to cause ankyrin-B syndrome, a condition characterized by a variety of heart problems. Most often, mutations in the ANK2 gene lead to abnormalities of the heart's natural pacemaker (the sinoatrial node), a heart rate that is slower than normal (bradycardia), a disruption in the rhythm of the heart (arrhythmia), and an increased risk of fainting (syncope) and sudden death.Each of the identified mutations in the ANK2 gene changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the ankyrin-B protein. Most of these mutations alter a region of the ankyrin-B protein important for its function. At least one ANK2 gene mutation prevents ankyrin-B from getting to the cell membrane where it is needed to function. As a result of these genetic changes, the ankyrin-B protein cannot target ion channels and ion transporters to their correct locations in cardiac muscle cells. Although the channels and transporters are produced normally by the cell, they are unable to function if they are not inserted correctly into the cell membrane. This loss of functional channels and transporters in the heart disrupts the normal flow of ions, which alters the heart's normal rhythm and leads to the heart problems that can be a part of ankyrin-B syndrome. "
100,ANKH ,ANKH inorganic pyrophosphate transport regulator,"The ANKH gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in skeletal development. The ANKH protein plays a role in the development and function of cells that build bones (osteoblasts) and cells that break down bone (osteoclasts). Osteoclasts are involved in bone remodeling, a normal process in which old bone is removed and new bone is created to replace it. In addition, the ANKH protein transports a molecule called pyrophosphate out of cells to the intricate network of proteins that forms in the spaces between cells (extracellular matrix). This extracellular pyrophosphate helps regulate bone formation by preventing mineralization, the process by which minerals such as calcium and phosphorus are deposited in tissues. The ANKH protein may have other, unknown functions.","Craniometaphyseal dysplasia More than 10 mutations in the ANKH gene have been found to cause autosomal dominant craniometaphyseal dysplasia, a condition characterized by thickening of bones in the skull (cranium) and widening of a region at the end of long bones known as the metaphysis. Some mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the ANKH protein, whereas others insert or delete one or more amino acids in the protein. These changes disrupt the functioning of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In particular, the maturation (differentiation) of osteoclasts is impaired, which likely disrupts bone remodeling. Reduced breakdown of bone tissue can contribute to the bone thickening characteristic of craniometaphyseal dysplasia. The altered ANKH proteins may also be less able to transport pyrophosphate out of cells. A shortage of extracellular pyrophosphate can increase bone mineralization, which may also contribute to the bone abnormalities. "
101,ANKRD11 ,ankyrin repeat domain 11,"The ANKRD11 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ankyrin repeat domain 11 (ANKRD11). As its name suggests, this protein contains multiple regions called ankyrin domains; proteins with these domains help other proteins interact with each other. The ANKRD11 protein interacts with certain proteins called histone deacetylases, which are important for controlling gene activity. Through these interactions, ANKRD11 affects when genes are turned on and off. For example, ANKRD11 brings together histone deacetylases and other proteins called p160 coactivators. This association regulates the ability of p160 coactivators to turn on gene activity. ANKRD11 may also enhance the activity of a protein called p53, which controls the growth and division (proliferation) and the self-destruction (apoptosis) of cells.The ANKRD11 protein is found in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. During embryonic development, ANKRD11 helps regulate the proliferation of these cells and development of the brain. Researchers speculate that the protein may also be involved in the ability of neurons to change and adapt over time (plasticity), which is important for learning and memory. ANKRD11 may function in other cells in the body and appears to be involved in normal bone development.","KBG syndrome Several ANKRD11 gene mutations have been found to cause KBG syndrome, a condition characterized by large upper front teeth and other unusual facial features, skeletal abnormalities, and intellectual disability. Most of these mutations lead to an abnormally short ANKRD11 protein, which likely has little or no function. Reduction of this protein's function is thought to underlie the signs and symptoms of the condition. Because ANKRD11 is thought to play an important role in neurons and brain development, researchers speculate that a partial loss of its function may lead to developmental delay and intellectual disability in KBG syndrome. However, the mechanism is not fully known. It is also unclear how loss of ANKRD11 function leads to the skeletal features of the condition.Another type of mutation that affects the ANKRD11 gene, called 16q24.3 microdeletion, deletes genetic material from chromosome 16 in a region designated q24.3. The deleted region typically removes the ANKRD11 and ZNF778 genes, although other nearby genes may also be affected. People with this type of mutation have similar signs and symptoms to those of KBG syndrome, including unusual facial features and intellectual disability. Many also have brain abnormalities and features of autism spectrum disorders, which are characterized by impaired communication and socialization skills. Some researchers think that these microdeletions are different enough from KBG syndrome to be considered a separate disorder, called 16q24.3 microdeletion syndrome. "
102,ANO5 ,anoctamin 5,"The ANO5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called anoctamin-5. While the specific function of this protein is not well understood, it belongs to a family of proteins, called anoctamins, that act as chloride channels. Chloride channels, which transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions) in and out of cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. Studies suggest that most anoctamin proteins function as chloride channels that are turned on (activated) in the presence of positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions); these channels are known as calcium-activated chloride channels. The mechanism for this calcium activation is unclear. Anoctamin proteins are also involved in maintaining the membrane that surrounds cells and repairing the membrane if it gets damaged.The anoctamin-5 protein is most abundant in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For the body to move normally, skeletal muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. The regulation of chloride flow within muscle cells plays a role in controlling muscle contraction and relaxation.The anoctamin-5 protein is also found in other cells including heart (cardiac) muscle cells and bone cells. Studies have suggested that the anoctamin-5 protein may be important for the development of muscle and bone before birth.","Gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia At least three ANO5 gene mutations have been identified in people with a bone disorder called gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia, which leads to fragile bones, jaw problems, and other skeletal abnormalities. The ANO5 gene mutations that cause gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the anoctamin-5 protein. It is unclear how these mutations lead to the signs and symptoms of gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia, or why they primarily affect bones while other ANO5 gene mutations cause muscle disorders. Researchers suggest that the mutations may affect the way cells process calcium, an important mineral in bone development and growth. "
103,ANOS1 ,anosmin 1,"The ANOS1 gene, also known as KAL1, provides instructions for making a protein called anosmin-1. This protein is involved in development before birth. Anosmin-1 is found in the extracellular matrix, which is the intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. Anosmin-1 is active in many parts of the developing embryo, including the respiratory tract, kidneys, digestive system, and certain regions of the brain.Researchers are working to determine the functions of anosmin-1. They have discovered that, in the developing brain, this protein is involved in the movement (migration) of nerve cells and the outgrowth of axons, which are specialized extensions of nerve cells that transmit nerve impulses. The protein also plays a role in regulating contact between nerve cells (cell adhesion).Anosmin-1 appears to help control the growth and migration of a group of nerve cells that are specialized to process the sense of smell (olfactory neurons). These nerve cells originate in the developing nose and then migrate together to a structure in the front of the brain called the olfactory bulb, which is critical for the perception of odors. Studies suggest that anosmin-1 is also involved in the migration of neurons that produce a hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Like olfactory neurons, GnRH-producing neurons migrate from the developing nose to the front of the brain. GnRH controls the production of several hormones that direct sexual development before birth and during puberty. These hormones are important for the normal function of the ovaries in women and testes in men.","Kallmann syndrome More than 140 mutations in the ANOS1 gene have been identified in people with Kallmann syndrome, a disorder characterized by the combination of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (a condition affecting the production of hormones that direct sexual development) and an impaired sense of smell. This condition can also affect other body systems, and its features vary among affected individuals. Researchers estimate that mutations in the ANOS1 gene account for 5 to 10 percent of all cases of Kallmann syndrome.The ANOS1 gene mutations that cause Kallmann syndrome delete part or all of the gene, change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in anosmin-1, or alter the size of the protein. All of these mutations disrupt the normal production or function of anosmin-1 during embryonic development. Researchers suspect that the missing or altered protein is unable to direct the migration of olfactory nerve cells and GnRH-producing nerve cells to their usual locations in the developing brain. If olfactory nerve cells do not extend to the olfactory bulb, a person's sense of smell will be impaired. Misplacement of GnRH-producing neurons prevents the production of sex hormones, which interferes with normal sexual development and causes puberty to be delayed or absent.It is unclear how ANOS1 gene mutations lead to other possible signs and symptoms of Kallmann syndrome, including a failure of one kidney to develop (unilateral renal agenesis), hearing loss, and mirror movements of the hands (bimanual synkinesia). Because these features vary among individuals, researchers suspect that other genetic and environmental factors may be involved. Some affected individuals have mutations in one of several other genes in addition to ANOS1, and these genetic changes may contribute to the varied features of the condition. "
104,ANTXR2 ,ANTXR cell adhesion molecule 2,"The ANTXR2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found at the surface of many types of cells. The ANTXR2 protein is believed to interact with components of the extracellular matrix, which is the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell. This matrix strengthens and supports connective tissues, such as skin, bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments.The ANTXR2 protein is involved in the formation of tiny blood vessels (capillaries). It may also be important for maintaining the structure of basement membranes, which are thin, sheet-like extracellular matrix structures that separate and support cells in many connective tissues. Research suggests that the ANTXR2 protein aids in the breakdown of at least one type of extracellular matrix protein, ensuring the correct balance of proteins is maintained for normal functioning of muscles and connective tissues.The ANTXR2 protein also acts as a receptor for the toxin that causes anthrax, allowing the toxin to attach to cells and trigger disease.","Hyaline fibromatosis syndrome More than 45 mutations in the ANTXR2 gene have been found to cause hyaline fibromatosis syndrome, a painful condition characterized by accumulation of a clear (hyaline) substance in different tissues in the body. The nature of the hyaline substance is unknown, but it likely contains extracellular matrix proteins, among other materials. Buildup of this material can cause firm lumps of noncancerous tissue (nodules) under the skin and in internal organs, joint deformities called contractures that restrict movement, and overgrowth of the gums. The severity of the signs and symptoms falls along a spectrum. The most severely affected individuals have severe diarrhea and recurrent infections and usually do not survive beyond early childhood. Individuals at the milder end of the spectrum typically survive into adulthood.Some ANTXR2 gene mutations reduce or eliminate the amount of ANTXR2 protein at the surface of cells. Others are thought to impair the protein's ability to interact with extracellular matrix components. It is unclear what effect these mutations have in cells and tissues. Researchers suspect that gene mutations disrupt the formation of basement membranes, allowing a hyaline substance to leak through and build up in various body tissues. Alternatively, the mutations could impair the breakdown of excess extracellular matrix proteins, which then accumulate in tissues and lead to the signs and symptoms of hyaline fibromatosis syndrome.It is unclear why the severity of hyaline fibromatosis syndrome varies among affected individuals. Some studies have indicated that the severity of the condition may be linked to where in the gene the mutation occurs. "
105,APC ,"APC, WNT signaling pathway regulator","The APC gene provides instructions for making the APC protein, which plays a critical role in several cellular processes. The APC protein acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it keeps cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way. It helps control how often a cell divides, how it attaches to other cells within a tissue, and whether a cell moves within or away from a tissue. This protein also helps ensure that the number of chromosomes in a cell is correct following cell division. The APC protein accomplishes these tasks mainly through association with other proteins, especially those that are involved in cell attachment and signaling.One protein with which APC associates is beta-catenin. Beta-catenin helps control the activity (expression) of particular genes and promotes the growth and division (proliferation) of cells and the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation). Beta-catenin also helps cells attach to one another and is important for tissue formation. Association of APC with beta-catenin signals for beta-catenin to be broken down when it is no longer needed.","Desmoid tumor Several mutations in the APC gene have been found in people with a type of aggressive but noncancerous (benign) growth called a desmoid tumor. These rare tumors arise from connective tissue, which provides strength and flexibility to structures such as bones, ligaments, and muscles. APC gene mutations typically cause formation of desmoid tumors in the abdomen, but these tumors can also occur in other parts of the body. Although APC-related desmoid tumors are commonly associated with a form of colon cancer called familial adenomatous polyposis (described below), APC gene mutations can cause tumors in individuals without this inherited disease. APC gene mutations are found in about 10 to 15 percent of non-inherited (sporadic) desmoid tumors; these mutations are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in tumor cells.Most APC gene mutations that cause sporadic desmoid tumors lead to an abnormally short APC protein. The shortened protein is unable to interact with the beta-catenin protein, which prevents the breakdown of beta-catenin when it is no longer needed. Excess beta-catenin promotes uncontrolled growth and division of cells, allowing the formation of desmoid tumors. "
106,APOA1 ,apolipoprotein A1,"The APOA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). ApoA-I is a component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). HDL is a molecule that transports cholesterol and certain fats called phospholipids through the bloodstream from the body's tissues to the liver. Once in the liver, cholesterol and phospholipids are redistributed to other tissues or removed from the body.ApoA-I attaches to cell membranes and promotes the movement of cholesterol and phospholipids from inside the cell to the outer surface. Once outside the cell, these substances combine with apoA-I to form HDL. ApoA-I also triggers a reaction called cholesterol esterification that converts cholesterol to a form that can be fully integrated into HDL and transported through the bloodstream.HDL is often referred to as ""good cholesterol"" because high levels of this substance reduce the chances of developing heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. The process of removing excess cholesterol from cells is extremely important for balancing cholesterol levels and maintaining cardiovascular health.","Familial HDL deficiency Mutations in the APOA1 gene cause familial HDL deficiency, an inherited condition characterized by low levels of HDL in the blood and an elevated risk for early-onset cardiovascular disease, which often occurs before age 50. These mutations lead to an altered apoA-I protein. Some versions of the altered protein are less able to promote the removal of cholesterol and phospholipids from cells, which decreases the amount of these substances available to form HDL. Other versions of the altered protein are less able to stimulate cholesterol esterification, which means cholesterol cannot be integrated into HDL particles. Both types of mutation result in low HDL levels. A shortage (deficiency) of HDL is believed to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. "
107,APOB ,apolipoprotein B,"The APOB gene provides instructions for making two versions of the apolipoprotein B protein, a short version called apolipoprotein B-48 and a longer version known as apolipoprotein B-100. Both of these proteins are components of lipoproteins, which are particles that carry fats and fat-like substances (such as cholesterol) in the blood.Apolipoprotein B-48 is produced in the intestine, where it is a building block of a type of lipoprotein called a chylomicron. As food is digested after a meal, chylomicrons are formed to carry fat and cholesterol from the intestine into the bloodstream. Chylomicrons are also necessary for the absorption of certain fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin E and vitamin A.Apolipoprotein B-100, which is produced in the liver, is a component of several other types of lipoproteins. Specifically, this protein is a building block of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs), and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). These related molecules all transport fats and cholesterol in the bloodstream.LDLs are the primary carriers of cholesterol in the blood. Apolipoprotein B-100 allows LDLs to attach to specific receptors on the surface of cells, particularly in the liver. Once attached, the receptors transport LDLs into the cell, where they are broken down to release cholesterol. The cholesterol is then used by the cell, stored, or removed from the body.","Familial hypercholesterolemia More than 100 mutations in the APOB gene are known to cause familial hypercholesterolemia. This condition is characterized by very high levels of cholesterol in the blood and an increased risk of developing heart disease. Each mutation that causes this condition changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in a critical region of apolipoprotein B-100. (Apolipoprotein B-48 is normal.) The altered protein prevents LDLs from effectively attaching to their receptors on the surface of cells. As a result, fewer LDLs are removed from the blood, and blood cholesterol levels are much higher than normal. As the excess cholesterol circulates through the bloodstream, it is deposited abnormally in tissues such as the skin, tendons, and arteries that supply blood to the heart (coronary arteries). A buildup of cholesterol in the walls of coronary arteries greatly increases a person's risk of having a heart attack.Most people with familial hypercholesterolemia inherit one altered copy of the APOB gene from an affected parent and one normal copy of the gene from the other parent. These cases are associated with an increased risk of early heart disease, typically beginning in a person's forties or fifties. Rarely, a person with familial hypercholesterolemia is born with two mutated copies of the APOB gene. This situation occurs when the person has two affected parents, each of whom passes on one altered copy of the gene. The presence of two APOB gene mutations results in a more severe form of hypercholesterolemia that usually appears in childhood. "
108,APOE ,apolipoprotein E,"The APOE gene provides instructions for making a protein called apolipoprotein E. This protein combines with fats (lipids) in the body to form molecules called lipoproteins. Lipoproteins are responsible for packaging cholesterol and other fats and carrying them through the bloodstream. Maintaining normal levels of cholesterol is essential for the prevention of disorders that affect the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular diseases), including heart attack and stroke.There are at least three slightly different versions (alleles) of the APOE gene. The major alleles are called e2, e3, and e4. The most common allele is e3, which is found in more than half of the general population.","Alzheimer disease The e4 version of the APOE gene increases an individual's risk for developing late-onset Alzheimer disease. Alzheimer disease is a degenerative disease of the brain that causes dementia, which is a gradual loss of memory, judgment, and ability to function. The late-onset form of the condition occurs in people older than age 65. People who inherit one copy of the APOE e4 allele have an increased chance of developing the disease; those who inherit two copies of the allele are at even greater risk. The APOE e4 allele may also be associated with an earlier onset of memory loss and other symptoms compared to individuals with Alzheimer disease who do not have this allele.It is not known how the APOE e4 allele is related to the risk of Alzheimer disease. However, researchers have found that this allele is associated with an increased number of protein clumps, called amyloid plaques, in the brain tissue of affected people. A buildup of amyloid plaques may lead to the death of nerve cells (neurons) and the progressive signs and symptoms of this disorder.It is important to note that people with the APOE e4 allele inherit an increased risk of developing Alzheimer disease, not the disease itself. Not all people with Alzheimer disease have the APOE e4 allele, and not all people who have this allele will develop the disease. "
109,APP ,amyloid beta precursor protein,"The APP gene provides instructions for making a protein called amyloid precursor protein. This protein is found in many tissues and organs, including the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). Little is known about the function of amyloid precursor protein. Researchers speculate that it may bind to other proteins on the surface of cells or help cells attach to one another. Studies suggest that in the brain, it helps direct the movement (migration) of nerve cells (neurons) during early development.Amyloid precursor protein is cut by enzymes to create smaller fragments (peptides), some of which are released outside the cell. Two of these fragments are called soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) and amyloid beta (β) peptide. Recent evidence suggests that sAPP has growth-promoting properties and may play a role in the formation of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain both before and after birth. The sAPP peptide may also control the function of certain other proteins by turning off (inhibiting) their activity. Amyloid β peptide is likely involved in the ability of neurons to change and adapt over time (plasticity). Other functions of sAPP and amyloid β peptide are under investigation.","Alzheimer disease More than 50 different mutations in the APP gene can cause early-onset Alzheimer disease, which begins before age 65. These mutations are responsible for less than 10 percent of all early-onset cases of the disorder.The most common APP mutation changes one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) in the amyloid precursor protein. This mutation replaces the amino acid valine with the amino acid isoleucine at protein position 717 (written as Val717Ile or V717I). Mutations in the APP gene can lead to an increased amount of the amyloid β peptide or to the production of a slightly longer and stickier form of the peptide. When these protein fragments are released from the cell, they can accumulate in the brain and form clumps called amyloid plaques. These plaques are characteristic of Alzheimer disease. A buildup of toxic amyloid β peptide and amyloid plaques may lead to the death of neurons and the progressive signs and symptoms of this disorder. "
110,APRT ,adenine phosphoribosyltransferase,"The APRT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT). This enzyme is produced in all cells and is part of the purine salvage pathway, which recycles a group of DNA building blocks (nucleotides) called purines to make other molecules. The APRT enzyme helps to recycle the purine adenine to make a molecule called adenosine monophosphate (AMP). This conversion occurs when AMP is needed as a source of energy for cells.","Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency At least 40 mutations in the APRT gene have been found to cause adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficiency, a condition that affects the kidneys and urinary tract. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the APRT enzyme. The mutations that cause APRT deficiency are categorized into two groups known as the APRT*J allele and the APRT*Q0 allele. The APRT*J allele consists of one mutation that replaces the amino acid methionine with the amino acid threonine at position 136 in the APRT enzyme (written as Met136Thr or M136T). This mutation reduces the function of the enzyme. The M136T mutation occurs almost exclusively in Japanese individuals with the condition; most affected individuals have this mutation on both copies of the APRT gene in each cell. The APRT*Q0 allele consists of all other APRT gene mutations. The most common of these mutations (written IVS4+2insT) alters the genetic instructions used to make the enzyme, resulting in an abnormally short, nonfunctional enzyme. This mutation is estimated to occur in 40 percent of affected Europeans.APRT gene mutations lead to a lack of functional enzyme that prevents the conversion of adenine to AMP. As a result, adenine is converted to another molecule called 2,8-dihydroxyadenine (2,8-DHA). 2,8-DHA crystallizes in urine, forming stones in the kidneys and urinary tract. As a result, kidney function can decline, which may lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a life-threatening failure of kidney function. "
111,APTX ,aprataxin,"The APTX gene provides instructions for making a protein called aprataxin that is involved in the repair of DNA damage in cells. Aprataxin is located in the nucleus of cells and is produced in various tissues, including the brain, spinal cord, and muscles. Different parts of the aprataxin protein allow the protein to interact with other DNA repair proteins to make repairs. At the site of the damage, aprataxin modifies the broken ends of the DNA strands so they can be joined back together correctly.","Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia More than 30 mutations in the APTX gene have been found to cause ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1. This condition is characterized by difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia) and problems with side-to-side movements of the eyes (oculomotor apraxia). Most mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in aprataxin, resulting in an unstable aprataxin protein that is quickly broken down in the cell. A lack of functional aprataxin disrupts DNA repair and can lead to an accumulation of damage in cells, particularly affecting cells in the part of the brain involved in coordinating movements (the cerebellum). This accumulation can lead to cell death in the cerebellum, causing the characteristic movement problems of ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1. "
112,AQP2 ,aquaporin 2,"The AQP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called aquaporin 2. This protein forms a channel that carries water molecules across cell membranes. It is found in the kidneys in structures called collecting ducts, which are a series of small tubes that reabsorb water from the kidneys into the bloodstream.The aquaporin 2 water channel plays an essential role in maintaining the body's water balance. The placement of these channels is controlled by a hormone called vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone (ADH). When a person's fluid intake is low or when a lot of fluid is lost (for example, through sweating), the body produces more ADH. This hormone triggers chemical reactions that ultimately insert aquaporin 2 water channels into the membrane of collecting duct cells. These channels allow water to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream, which makes the urine more concentrated. When fluid intake is adequate, less ADH is produced. Without signals from ADH, aquaporin 2 water channels are removed from the membrane of collecting duct cells. At these times, less water is reabsorbed into the bloodstream and the urine is more dilute.","Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus At least 40 mutations in the AQP2 gene have been identified in people with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.Most of the known AQP2 gene mutations cause the aquaporin 2 protein to be misfolded into an incorrect 3-dimensional shape. The misfolded protein is trapped within the cell, where it is unable to reach the cell membrane to transport water molecules. A few mutations result in the production of functional aquaporin 2 water channels, but these channels are misrouted within the cell and do not reach the cell membrane.If aquaporin 2 water channels are not inserted into the membrane of collecting duct cells, the kidneys are unable to respond to signals from ADH. As a result, collecting ducts do not reabsorb water as they should, and the body makes excessive amounts of urine. These problems with water balance are characteristic of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. "
113,AR ,androgen receptor,"The AR gene provides instructions for making a protein called an androgen receptor. Androgens are hormones (such as testosterone) that are important for normal male sexual development before birth and during puberty. Androgen receptors allow the body to respond appropriately to these hormones. The receptors are present in many of the body's tissues, where they attach (bind) to androgens. The resulting androgen-receptor complex then binds to DNA and regulates the activity of androgen-responsive genes. By turning the genes on or off as necessary, the androgen receptor helps direct the development of male sexual characteristics. Androgens and androgen receptors also have other important functions in both males and females, such as regulating hair growth and sex drive.In one region of the AR gene, a DNA segment known as CAG is repeated multiple times. This CAG segment is called a triplet or trinucleotide repeat. In most people, the number of CAG repeats in the AR gene ranges from fewer than 10 to about 36.","Androgen insensitivity syndrome More than 600 different mutations in the AR gene have been identified in people with androgen insensitivity syndrome, a condition that affects sexual development before birth and during puberty. Most of these mutations are changes in single DNA building blocks (base pairs). Other mutations insert or delete multiple base pairs in the gene or affect how the gene is processed into a protein. Some mutations lead to an abnormally short version of the androgen receptor protein, while others result in the production of an abnormal receptor that cannot bind to androgens or to DNA. As a result, cells that are sensitive to androgens become less responsive to these hormones or unable to use these hormones at all. People with this condition are genetically male, with one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each cell. Because their bodies are unable to respond to androgens, they may have mostly female sex characteristics or signs of both male and female sexual development.Mutations that completely eliminate the function of the androgen receptor cause complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. Genetic changes that significantly reduce but do not eliminate the receptor's activity cause partial androgen insensitivity syndrome. Mild androgen insensitivity syndrome results from changes that only slightly reduce the activity of the receptor. "
114,ARFGEF2 ,ADP ribosylation factor guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2,"The ARFGEF2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps with the movement (trafficking) of small sac-like structures (vesicles) within the cell. The ARFGEF2 protein converts a molecule called guanine diphosphate (GDP) to another molecule called guanine triphosphate (GTP). This reaction activates an ADP-ribosylation factor, a molecule that is involved in vesicle trafficking. Vesicles transport many types of molecules from the interior of the cell to its surface, where they may attach and interact with other substances, or be secreted by the cell.","Periventricular heterotopia A few mutations in the ARFGEF2 gene have been identified in individuals with periventricular heterotopia. These mutations may interfere with vesicle trafficking, which is important in controlling cell migration during the development of the brain. Nerve cells (neurons) that do not migrate properly during development form clumps around fluid-filled cavities (ventricles) near the center of the brain, resulting in the signs and symptoms of periventricular heterotopia.Mutations in the ARFGEF2 gene may also result in weakening of the attachments (adhesion) between cells that form the lining of the ventricles, by impairing the trafficking of the molecules needed for this adhesion. A weakened ventricular lining could allow some neurons to form clumps around the ventricles while others migrate normally to the exterior of the brain, as seen in periventricular heterotopia. "
115,ARG1 ,arginase 1,"The ARG1 gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme arginase. This enzyme participates in the urea cycle, a series of reactions that occurs in liver cells. The urea cycle processes excess nitrogen, which is generated when proteins and their building blocks (amino acids) are used by the body. Through the urea cycle, excess nitrogen is made into a compound called urea that is excreted by the kidneys. Excreting the excess nitrogen prevents it from accumulating in the form of ammonia, which is toxic.Arginase controls the last step of the urea cycle, a reaction in which nitrogen is removed from the amino acid arginine and processed into urea for excretion from the body. A compound called ornithine is also produced in this reaction; it is needed for the urea cycle to repeat.","Arginase deficiency Approximately 12 mutations have been identified in the ARG1 gene. A mutated ARG1 gene may result in an arginase enzyme that is unstable, shorter than usual or the wrong shape, or may prevent the enzyme from being produced at all.The shape of an enzyme affects its ability to control a chemical reaction. If the arginase enzyme is misshapen or missing, it cannot fulfill its role in the urea cycle. Excess nitrogen is not converted to urea for excretion, and ammonia and arginine accumulate in the body. Ammonia is toxic, especially to the nervous system, and the accumulation of ammonia and arginine are believed to cause the neurological problems and other signs and symptoms of arginase deficiency. "
116,ARHGAP31 ,Rho GTPase activating protein 31,"The ARHGAP31 gene provides instructions for making a protein classified as a Rho GTPase activating protein (GAP). GAPs turn off (inactivate) proteins called GTPases, which play an important role in chemical signaling within cells. Often referred to as molecular switches, GTPases can be turned on and off. They are turned on (active) when they are attached (bound) to a molecule called GTP and are turned off when they are bound to another molecule called GDP. The ARHGAP31 protein inactivates GTPases known as Cdc42 and Rac1 by stimulating a reaction that turns the attached GTP into GDP. When active, Cdc42 and Rac1 transmit signals that are critical for various aspects of embryonic development. The ARHGAP31 protein appears to regulate these GTPases specifically during development of the limbs, skull, and heart.","Adams-Oliver syndrome At least three mutations in the ARHGAP31 gene are known to cause Adams-Oliver syndrome, a condition characterized by areas of missing skin (aplasia cutis congenita), usually on the scalp, and malformations of the hands and feet. These mutations lead to production of an abnormally short ARHGAP31 protein that is more active than normal. The increased GAP activity leads to a reduction in Cdc42 and Rac1 signaling, which impairs proper development of the skin on the top of the head and the bones in the hands and feet. "
117,ARID1A ,AT-rich interaction domain 1A,"The ARID1A gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms one piece (subunit) of several different SWI/SNF protein complexes. SWI/SNF complexes regulate gene activity (expression) by a process known as chromatin remodeling. Chromatin is the network of DNA and protein that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. Chromatin remodeling is one way gene expression is regulated during development; when DNA is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when DNA is loosely packed.Through their ability to regulate gene activity, SWI/SNF complexes are involved in many processes, including repairing damaged DNA; copying (replicating) DNA; and controlling the growth, division, and maturation (differentiation) of cells. The ARID1A protein and other SWI/SNF subunits are thought to act as tumor suppressors, which keep cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.The ARID1A subunit is able to attach (bind) to DNA and is thought to help target SWI/SNF complexes to the chromatin location that needs to be remodeled.","Coffin-Siris syndrome At least three mutations in the ARID1A gene can cause Coffin-Siris syndrome. This condition is characterized by delayed development, abnormalities of the fifth (pinky) fingers or toes, and characteristic facial features that are described as coarse. The ARID1A gene mutations involved in Coffin-Siris syndrome lead to an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein. As a result, affected individuals have half the normal amount of functioning ARID1A protein. Although it is unclear how these changes affect SWI/SNF complexes, researchers suggest that ARID1A gene mutations result in abnormal chromatin remodeling. Disturbance of this process alters the activity of many genes and disrupts several cellular processes, which could explain the diverse signs and symptoms of Coffin-Siris syndrome. People with Coffin-Siris syndrome do not appear to have an increased risk of cancer (see below). "
118,ARID1B ,AT-rich interaction domain 1B,"The ARID1B gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms one piece (subunit) of several different SWI/SNF protein complexes. SWI/SNF complexes regulate gene activity (expression) by a process known as chromatin remodeling. Chromatin is the network of DNA and proteins that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. Chromatin remodeling is one way gene expression is regulated during development; when DNA is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when DNA is loosely packed.Through their ability to regulate gene activity, SWI/SNF complexes are involved in many processes, including repairing damaged DNA; copying (replicating) DNA; and controlling the growth, division, and maturation (differentiation) of cells. The ARID1B protein and other SWI/SNF subunits are thought to act as tumor suppressors, which keep cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.The ARID1B subunit is able to attach (bind) to DNA and is thought to help target SWI/SNF complexes to the chromatin location that needs to be remodeled.","Coffin-Siris syndrome At least 69 mutations in the ARID1B gene have been found to cause Coffin-Siris syndrome. This condition is characterized by delayed development, abnormalities of the fifth (pinky) fingers or toes, and characteristic facial features that are described as coarse. Most ARID1B gene mutations involved in Coffin-Siris syndrome lead to an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein. As a result, affected individuals have half the normal amount of functional ARID1B protein. Although it is unclear how these changes affect SWI/SNF complexes, researchers suggest that ARID1B gene mutations result in abnormal chromatin remodeling. Disturbance of this process alters the activity of many genes and disrupts several cellular processes, which could explain the diverse signs and symptoms of Coffin-Siris syndrome. People with Coffin-Siris syndrome do not appear to have an increased risk of cancer (see below). "
119,ARMC5 ,armadillo repeat containing 5,"The ARMC5 gene provides instructions for making a protein about which little is known. It is found mainly in the fluid surrounding the cell nucleus (cytoplasm), and studies suggest that its function depends on interacting with other proteins. It is thought to act as a tumor suppressor, which means that it helps to prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.","Primary macronodular adrenal hyperplasia At least 24 mutations in the ARMC5 gene have been identified in people with primary macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (PMAH), a disorder that causes multiple lumps (nodules) to form in the adrenal glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. These nodules cause adrenal gland enlargement (hyperplasia) and result in production of higher-than-normal levels of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol normally helps maintain blood sugar levels, protects the body from physical stress, and suppresses inflammation. Increased cortisol levels can lead to weight gain in the face and upper body, fragile skin, bone loss, fatigue, and other health problems, which often occur in people with PMAH.People with PMAH caused by ARMC5 gene mutations inherit one copy of the mutated gene in each cell. However, the condition develops only when affected individuals acquire a second mutation in the other copy of the ARMC5 gene in certain cells of the adrenal glands. This second mutation is described as somatic. Instead of being passed from parent to child, somatic mutations are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. Because somatic mutations are also required for PMAH to occur, some people who have inherited the altered ARMC5 gene never develop the condition, a situation known as reduced penetrance.The ARMC5 gene mutations that cause PMAH are thought to impair the protein's tumor suppressor function, which allows the overgrowth of certain cells. It is unclear why this overgrowth is limited to the adrenal glands in people with PMAH. "
120,ARMS2 ,age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2,"The ARMS2 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. Studies suggest that the ARMS2 protein is found primarily in the placenta and in the specialized light-sensing tissue in the back of the eye (the retina). However, it is unclear what role, if any, the protein plays in early development or normal vision.","Age-related macular degeneration The ARMS2 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 10 in a region known as 10q26. This region has been strongly associated with the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration, a common cause of vision loss in older adults. Researchers have identified several variations (polymorphisms) in and near the ARMS2 gene that may explain the association between the 10q26 region and age-related macular degeneration. The best-studied of these variations, known as rs10490924, alters a single protein building block (amino acid) in the ARMS2 protein. Another common variation, a complex change that deletes a segment of the ARMS2 gene and inserts new genetic material, may also contribute to disease risk.It is unclear how polymorphisms in the ARMS2 gene might be related to age-related macular degeneration. In the 10q26 region, the ARMS2 gene is located next to a gene called HTRA1; changes in this gene have also been studied as a risk factor for the disease. Because the two genes are so close together, it is difficult to tell whether changes in one gene or the other, or possibly changes in both genes, account for the increased disease risk. Age-related macular degeneration is a complex condition that likely results from a combination of multiple genetic and environmental factors. "
121,ARSA ,arylsulfatase A,"The ARSA gene provides instructions for making the enzyme arylsulfatase A. This enzyme is located in cellular structures called lysosomes, which are the cell's recycling centers. Within lysosomes, arylsulfatase A helps process substances known as sulfatides. Sulfatides are a subgroup of sphingolipids, a category of fats that are important components of cell membranes. Sulfatides are abundant in the nervous system's white matter, consisting of nerve fibers covered by myelin. Myelin, made up of multiple layers of membranes, insulates and protects nerves.","Metachromatic leukodystrophy More than 110 mutations that cause metachromatic leukodystrophy, a disorder that causes deterioration of nervous system functions, have been identified in the ARSA gene. These mutations greatly reduce the activity of arylsulfatase A. Severe disruption in arylsulfatase A activity interferes with the breakdown of sulfatides. As a result, these substances can accumulate to toxic levels in the nervous system. The buildup of sulfatides gradually destroys the cells that produce myelin, the covering that protects nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. Destruction of myelin leads to the loss of white matter (leukodystrophy) and impairment of nervous system function, resulting in the signs and symptoms of metachromatic leukodystrophy.In some cases, individuals with very low arylsulfatase A activity show no signs or symptoms of metachromatic leukodystrophy. This condition, called pseudoarylsulfatase deficiency, seems to be caused by specific variations of the ARSA gene. These variations are present in as many as 5 to 10 percent of Europeans and North Americans. "
122,ARSB ,arylsulfatase B,"The ARSB gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called arylsulfatase B, which is involved in the breakdown of large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Specifically, arylsulfatase B removes a chemical group known as a sulfate from two GAGs called dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. Arylsulfatase B is located in lysosomes, compartments within cells that digest and recycle different types of molecules.","Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI More than 130 mutations in the ARSB gene have been found to cause mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI). Most of these mutations change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the gene. All of the mutations that cause MPS VI reduce or eliminate the function of arylsulfatase B. It usually cannot be determined whether a certain mutation will cause severe or mild MPS VI; however, mutations known to result in the complete absence of arylsulfatase B activity cause severe signs and symptoms.The lack of arylsulfatase B activity leads to the accumulation of GAGs within lysosomes. Conditions such as MPS VI that cause molecules to build up inside the lysosomes are called lysosomal storage disorders. The accumulation of GAGs within lysosomes increases the size of cells, which is why many tissues and organs are enlarged in this disorder. Researchers believe that the buildup of GAGs may also interfere with the functions of other proteins inside lysosomes, triggering inflammation and cell death. "
123,ARSL ,arylsulfatase E,"The ARSL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called arylsulfatase E. This enzyme is part of a group known as sulfatases, which are enzymes that help process molecules that contain chemical groups known as sulfates. Sulfatases play important roles in cartilage and bone development.Within cells, arylsulfatase E is located in the Golgi apparatus, a structure that modifies newly produced enzymes and other proteins. The function of this enzyme is unknown, although researchers believe it participates in a chemical pathway involving vitamin K. Evidence suggests that vitamin K normally plays a role in bone growth and maintenance of bone density.","X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 1 Genetic changes involving the ARSL gene are responsible for X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 1, a disorder of bone and cartilage development that occurs almost exclusively in males. Between 60 and 75 percent of males with the characteristic features of this condition have a mutation within the ARSL gene. At least 18 mutations have been found in affected individuals; these genetic changes reduce or eliminate the function of arylsulfatase E. Another 25 percent of affected males have a small deletion of genetic material from the region of the X chromosome that contains the ARSL gene. These individuals are missing the entire gene, so their cells produce no functional arylsulfatase E.It is unclear how a shortage of arylsulfatase E disrupts the development of bones and cartilage and leads to the characteristic features of X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 1. "
124,ARX ,aristaless related homeobox,"The ARX gene provides instructions for producing a protein that regulates the activity of other genes. On the basis of this action, the ARX protein is called a transcription factor. The ARX gene is part of a larger family of homeobox genes, which act during early embryonic development to control the formation of many body structures. Specifically, the ARX protein is believed to be involved in the development of the brain, pancreas, testes, and muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles).In the pancreas, testes, and skeletal muscles, the ARX protein helps to regulate the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation). Within the developing brain, the ARX protein is involved with movement (migration) and communication of nerve cells (neurons). In particular, this protein regulates genes that play a role in the migration of specialized neurons (interneurons) to their proper location. Interneurons relay signals between other neurons.","Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 1 Mutations in the ARX gene can cause early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 1 (EIEE1), a disorder characterized by recurrent seizures called infantile spasms that begin in the first year of life. Children with this condition also have intellectual disability.The normal ARX protein contains four regions where a protein building block (amino acid) called alanine is repeated multiple times. These stretches of alanines are known as polyalanine tracts. The most common ARX gene mutations that cause EIEE1 add extra alanines to the first or second polyalanine tract in the ARX protein. This type of mutation is called a polyalanine repeat expansion. Research suggests that these polyalanine repeat expansions reduce the amount of ARX protein in cells, although the mechanism is unclear. Other ARX gene mutations that cause this condition are believed to reduce the function of the ARX protein. A shortage of ARX function is thought to impair the normal development and migration of certain interneurons, which likely underlies infantile spasms and other neurological problems characteristic of EIEE1. "
125,ASAH1 ,N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 1,"The ASAH1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called acid ceramidase. This enzyme is found in lysosomes, which are cell compartments that digest and recycle materials. Within lysosomes, acid ceramidase breaks down fats called ceramides. Ceramides are typically found within the membranes that surround cells and play a role in regulating cell maturation (differentiation), growth and division of cells (proliferation), and controlled cell death (apoptosis). Additionally, ceramides are a component of a fatty substance called myelin that insulates and protects nerve cells. When ceramides need to be replaced, they travel to lysosomes where acid ceramidase breaks them down into a fat called sphingosine and a fatty acid. These two breakdown products are recycled to create new ceramides for the body to use.","Farber lipogranulomatosis At least 20 mutations in the ASAH1 gene have been found to cause Farber lipogranulomatosis. This condition is characterized by the buildup of fats (lipids) in cells throughout the body, particularly around the joints. Most of the mutations associated with Farber lipogranulomatosis change a single protein building block (amino acid) in acid ceramidase, which severely reduces the activity of the enzyme, typically to less than one-tenth of normal. As a result, the enzyme cannot break down ceramides properly and they build up in the lysosomes of various cells, including in the lungs, liver, muscles, brain, cartilage, and bone. It is unclear how an accumulation of ceramides impairs the normal functioning of cells, but these damaged cells lead to the voice, skin, and joint problems that are characteristic of Farber lipogranulomatosis. Ceramides influence various cell functions, and it is likely that abnormal regulation of these processes also contributes to the features of this condition. "
126,ASH1L ,ASH1 like histone lysine methyltransferase,"The ASH1L gene, also known as KMT2H, provides instructions for making an enzyme, called lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H, that is found in many organs and tissues of the body. Lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H functions as a histone methyltransferase. Histone methyltransferases are enzymes that modify proteins called histones. Histones are structural proteins that attach (bind) to DNA and give chromosomes their shape. By adding a molecule called a methyl group to histones (a process called methylation), histone methyltransferases control (regulate) the activity of certain genes. Lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H appears to turn on (activate) certain genes that are especially important for development of the brain.","Autism spectrum disorder At least seven ASH1L gene mutations have been identified in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a varied condition characterized by impaired social skills, communication problems, and repetitive behaviors. Some ASH1L gene mutations associated with ASD change one building block (amino acid) in the lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H enzyme. Others delete genetic material in the ASH1L gene sequence or result in a premature stop signal that leads to an abnormally short enzyme. As a result of these mutations, the enzyme is nonfunctional. A lack of functional lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H enzyme disrupts histone methylation. The resulting changes in the expression of genes regulated by lysine-specific methyltransferase 2H affect brain development and increase the risk of ASD. Normal variations in other genes, as well as environmental risk factors, such as parental age, birth complications, and others that have not been identified, also affect an individual's risk of developing this complex condition. "
127,ASL ,argininosuccinate lyase,"The ASL gene provides instructions for making the protein argininosuccinate lyase. This enzyme participates in the urea cycle, a series of reactions that occur in liver cells. The urea cycle processes excess nitrogen, generated when protein is used by the body, to make a compound called urea that is excreted by the kidneys. Excreting the excess nitrogen prevents it from accumulating in the form of ammonia.The specific role of the ASL enzyme is to start the reaction in which the amino acid arginine, a building block of proteins, is produced from argininosuccinate, the molecule that carries the waste nitrogen collected earlier in the urea cycle. The arginine is later broken down into urea, which is excreted, and ornithine, which restarts the urea cycle.","Argininosuccinic aciduria More than 30 different mutations in the ASL gene have been identified worldwide. In some cases, a short sequence of DNA is deleted from the gene. Other mutations replace one protein building block (amino acid) with another amino acid in the argininosuccinate lyase enzyme. In people of Arab descent, two common mutations replace the amino acid glutamine with a premature stop signal at position 116 (written as Gln116Ter or Q116X) or position 354 (written as Gln354Ter or Q354X) in the argininosuccinate lyase enzyme. Mutations in the ASL gene may result in an argininosuccinate lyase enzyme that is unstable or the wrong shape.The shape of an enzyme affects its ability to control a chemical reaction. If the argininosuccinate lyase enzyme is misshapen or missing, it cannot fulfill its role in the urea cycle. Excess nitrogen is not converted to urea for excretion, and ammonia accumulates in the body. Ammonia is toxic, especially to the nervous system, so this accumulation causes neurological problems and other signs and symptoms of argininosuccinic aciduria. "
128,ASNS ,asparagine synthetase (glutamine-hydrolyzing),"The ASNS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called asparagine synthetase. This enzyme is found in cells throughout the body, where it converts the protein building block (amino acid) aspartic acid to the amino acid asparagine. Another amino acid called glutamine helps in the conversion and is itself converted to the amino acid glutamic acid during the process. It is thought that asparagine synthetase helps to maintain the normal balance of these four amino acids in the body.Asparagine is needed to produce many proteins but also plays other roles. Asparagine helps to break down toxic ammonia within cells, is important for protein modification, and is needed for making a certain molecule that transmits signals in the brain (a neurotransmitter).Although asparagine can be obtained through the diet, the amino acid cannot cross the protective barrier that allows only certain substances to pass between blood vessels and the brain (the blood-brain barrier). As a result, brain cells rely solely on asparagine synthetase to produce asparagine.","Asparagine synthetase deficiency At least 15 mutations in the ASNS gene have been found to cause asparagine synthetase deficiency, a severe condition that causes neurological problems soon after birth. In most cases, these mutations replace single amino acids in the enzyme. The altered enzymes have little or no function. Asparagine from the diet likely makes up for the enzyme's inability to produce the amino acid in cells. However, because asparagine cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, brain cells in people with asparagine synthetase deficiency have a shortage (deficiency) of this amino acid. The exact effect of asparagine synthetase deficiency on brain cells is unknown, but because of the severe features of this condition, it is clear that asparagine is necessary for normal brain development. A lack of asparagine in developing brain cells leads to poor brain development and the severe neurological problems in individuals with asparagine synthetase deficiency. It is unclear whether a lack of glutamic acid or a buildup of glutamine impacts the signs and symptoms of this condition. "
129,ASPA ,aspartoacylase,"The ASPA gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aspartoacylase. In the brain, this enzyme breaks down a compound called N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid (NAA) into aspartic acid (an amino acid that is a building block of many proteins) and another molecule called acetic acid.The production and breakdown of NAA appears to be critical for maintaining the brain's white matter, which consists of nerve fibers surrounded by a myelin sheath. The myelin sheath is the covering that protects nerve fibers and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. The precise function of NAA is unclear. Researchers had suspected that it played a role in the production of the myelin sheath, but recent studies suggest that NAA does not have this function. The enzyme may instead be involved in the transport of water molecules out of nerve cells (neurons).","Canavan disease More than 80 mutations in the ASPA gene are known to cause Canavan disease, which is a rare inherited disorder that affects brain development. Researchers have described two major forms of this condition: neonatal/infantile Canavan disease, which is the most common and most severe form, and mild/juvenile Canavan disease. The ASPA gene mutations that cause the neonatal/infantile form severely impair the activity of aspartoacylase, preventing the breakdown of NAA and allowing this substance to build up to high levels in the brain. The mutations that cause the mild/juvenile form have milder effects on the enzyme's activity, leading to less accumulation of NAA.An excess of NAA in the brain is associated with the signs and symptoms of Canavan disease. Studies suggest that if NAA is not broken down properly, the resulting chemical imbalance interferes with the formation of the myelin sheath as the nervous system develops. A buildup of NAA also leads to the progressive destruction of existing myelin sheaths. Nerves without this protective covering malfunction, which disrupts normal brain development.While Canavan disease occurs in people of all ethnic backgrounds, it is most common in people of Ashkenazi (eastern and central European) Jewish heritage. Two specific ASPA gene mutations cause almost all cases of the disease in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. One of these mutations replaces the amino acid glutamic acid with the amino acid alanine at position 285 of the enzyme (written as Glu285Ala or E285A). This genetic change greatly reduces the amount of functional aspartoacylase. The other mutation, which is written as Tyr231Ter or Y231X, prematurely stops protein production and leads to an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the enzyme.A different ASPA gene mutation is most common in people who are not of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. This mutation substitutes the amino acid glutamic acid for the amino acid alanine at position 305 of aspartoacylase (written as Ala305Glu or A305E). This mutation also leads to the production of a nonfunctional version of the enzyme. "
130,ASPM ,abnormal spindle microtubule assembly,"The ASPM gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in cell division. This protein is found in cells and tissues throughout the body; however, it appears to be particularly important for the division of cells in the developing brain. Studies suggest that the ASPM protein helps maintain the orderly division of early brain cells called neural progenitor cells, which ultimately give rise to mature nerve cells (neurons). By promoting the division of neural progenitor cells during early brain development, the ASPM protein helps determine the total number of neurons and the overall size of the brain.","Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly Mutations in the ASPM gene are the most common cause of autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (often shortened to MCPH, which stands for ""microcephaly primary hereditary""). This condition is characterized by an abnormally small head and brain, intellectual disability, and delayed development. More than 80 mutations in the ASPM gene have been found to cause MCPH.Almost all of the ASPM gene mutations responsible for MCPH reduce production of the ASPM protein. The protein that is produced is shorter than normal and is thought to be partly or wholly nonfunctional. A shortage of functional ASPM protein impairs cell division, especially in neural progenitor cells in the developing brain. As a result, fewer mature neurons are produced, and affected individuals are born with an unusually small brain. Small head size, intellectual disability, and delayed development are all consequences of the small brain size.Because the ASPM protein is found in cells throughout the body, it is unclear why ASPM gene mutations affect neural progenitor cells more severely than other cell types. Some researchers believe that neural progenitor cells are more sensitive than other types of cells to a shortage of the ASPM protein. Other researchers have suggested that another protein may be able to compensate for the loss of the ASPM protein in cells outside the brain. "
131,ASS1 ,argininosuccinate synthase 1,"The ASS1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called argininosuccinate synthase 1. This enzyme participates in the urea cycle, which is a sequence of chemical reactions that takes place in liver cells. The urea cycle processes excess nitrogen that is generated as the body breaks down proteins. The excess nitrogen is used to make a compound called urea, which is excreted from the body in urine.Argininosuccinate synthase 1 is involved in the third step of the urea cycle. This step combines two protein building blocks (amino acids), citrulline and aspartate, to form a molecule called argininosuccinic acid. A series of additional chemical reactions uses argininosuccinic acid to form urea.","Citrullinemia At least 118 mutations that cause type I citrullinemia have been identified in the ASS1 gene. Type I citrullinemia is a serious condition that usually appears in the first few days of life. It causes life-threatening health problems, including poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, and loss of consciousness. Most of the mutations involved in type I citrullinemia change single amino acids in the argininosuccinate synthase 1 enzyme. These genetic changes likely alter the structure of the enzyme, impairing its ability to attach to molecules such as citrulline and aspartate. A few mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the enzyme that cannot effectively play its role in the urea cycle.Defects in argininosuccinate synthase 1 disrupt the third step of the urea cycle, preventing the liver from processing excess nitrogen into urea. As a result, nitrogen (in the form of ammonia) and other byproducts of the urea cycle (such as citrulline) build up in the bloodstream. Ammonia is toxic, particularly to the nervous system. An accumulation of ammonia during the first few days of life leads to poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, and the other signs and symptoms of type I citrullinemia. "
132,ASXL1 ,ASXL transcriptional regulator 1,"The ASXL1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in a process known as chromatin remodeling. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and proteins that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. When DNA is tightly packed, gene activity (expression) is lower than when DNA is loosely packed.Through its role in chromatin remodeling, the ASXL1 protein regulates the expression of many genes, including a group of genes known as HOX genes, which play important roles in development before birth. The ASXL1 protein can turn on (activate) or turn off (repress) HOX genes depending on when they are needed.The ASXL1 protein may have an additional role in gene regulation by signaling to molecules to add a methyl group (a process called methylation) to an area near a gene called the promoter region, which controls gene activity. When a promoter region is methylated, gene activity is repressed, and when a promoter region is not methylated, the gene is active.","Bohring-Opitz syndrome More than 20 mutations in the ASXL1 gene have been found to cause Bohring-Opitz syndrome, a condition that causes abnormal head size and shape, distinctive facial features, joint abnormalities, intellectual disability, and other signs and symptoms. Most of the ASXL1 gene mutations that cause Bohring-Opitz syndrome create a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the ASXL1 protein, resulting in either an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein or a complete lack of ASXL1 protein. These ASXL1 gene mutations are described as ""loss-of-function"" because they reduce the amount of functional ASXL1 protein available, which likely disrupts the regulation of the activity of HOX genes and other genes during development. Altered activity of HOX genes probably leads to the neurological and physical features of this condition. "
133,ATG16L1 ,autophagy related 16 like 1,"The ATG16L1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is required for a process called autophagy. Cells use this process to recycle worn-out cell parts and break down certain proteins when they are no longer needed. Autophagy also plays an important role in controlled cell death (apoptosis). Additionally, autophagy is involved in the body's inflammatory response and helps the immune system destroy some types of harmful bacteria and viruses.","Crohn disease At least one variation in the ATG16L1 gene is associated with an increased risk of Crohn disease, particularly a form of the disorder that affects the lower part of the small intestine (the ileum) and the colon. This increased risk has been found primarily in people of northern European ancestry. The identified ATG16L1 variation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in a critical region of the ATG16L1 protein. Specifically, it replaces the amino acid threonine with the amino acid alanine at protein position 300 (written as Thr300Ala or T300A).This change in the ATG16L1 gene impairs the autophagy process, allowing worn-out cell parts and harmful bacteria to persist when they would otherwise be destroyed. These cell components and bacteria may trigger an inappropriate immune system response, leading to chronic inflammation in the intestinal walls and the digestive problems characteristic of Crohn disease. Researchers continue to study the relationship between changes in the ATG16L1 gene and a person's risk of developing this disorder. "
134,ATL1 ,atlastin GTPase 1,"The ATL1 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called atlastin-1. Atlastin-1 is produced primarily in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), particularly in nerve cells (neurons) that extend down the spinal cord (corticospinal tracts). These neurons send electrical signals that lead to voluntary muscle movement. In neurons, this protein is found mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is a structure involved in protein processing and distribution. Atlastin-1 fuses together the network of tubules that make up the structure of the endoplasmic reticulum. Atlastin-1 is also active in compartments called axonal growth cones, which are located at the tip of neurons. The axonal growth cones direct the growth of specialized extensions, called axons, which transmit nerve impulses that signal muscle movement. Within axonal growth cones, atlastin-1 acts during development to help guide the growth of axons.","Spastic paraplegia type 3A Approximately 60 mutations in the ATL1 gene have been found to cause spastic paraplegia type 3A. This condition is characterized by muscle stiffness (spasticity) and weakness of the lower limbs (paraplegia), which begin in childhood. Most of the mutations that cause spastic paraplegia type 3A change one protein building block (amino acid) in the atlastin-1 protein. These mutations likely lead to abnormal activity of atlastin-1, which impairs the functioning of neurons, including the distribution of materials within these cells. This lack of functional atlastin-1 protein can also restrict the growth of axons. Within the long neurons of the corticospinal tracts, these problems can lead to cell death. As a result, the neurons are unable to transmit nerve impulses, particularly to other neurons and muscles in the lower extremities. This impaired nerve function leads to the signs and symptoms of spastic paraplegia type 3A. "
135,ATM ,ATM serine/threonine kinase,"The ATM gene provides instructions for making a protein that is located primarily in the nucleus of cells, where it helps control the rate at which cells grow and divide. This protein also plays an important role in the normal development and activity of several body systems, including the nervous system and the immune system. Additionally, the ATM protein assists cells in recognizing damaged or broken DNA strands. DNA can be damaged by agents such as toxic chemicals or radiation. Breaks in DNA strands also occur naturally when chromosomes exchange genetic material during cell division. The ATM protein coordinates DNA repair by activating enzymes that fix the broken strands. Efficient repair of damaged DNA strands helps maintain the stability of the cell's genetic information.Because of its central role in cell division and DNA repair, the ATM protein is of great interest in cancer research.","Ataxia-telangiectasia Researchers have identified several hundred mutations in the ATM gene that cause ataxia-telangiectasia. People with this disorder have mutations in both copies of the ATM gene in each cell. Most of these mutations disrupt protein production, resulting in an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the ATM protein. Cells without any functional ATM protein are hypersensitive to radiation and do not respond normally to DNA damage. Instead of activating DNA repair, the defective ATM protein allows mutations to accumulate in other genes, which may cause cells to grow and divide in an uncontrolled way. This kind of unregulated cell growth can lead to the formation of cancerous tumors. In addition, ATM mutations can allow cells to die inappropriately, particularly affecting cells in a part of the brain involved in coordinating movements (the cerebellum). This loss of brain cells causes the movement problems characteristic of ataxia-telangiectasia. "
136,ATN1 ,atrophin 1,"The ATN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called atrophin 1. Although the exact function of this protein is unknown, it appears to play an important role in nerve cells (neurons) in many areas of the brain. Based on studies in other animals, researchers speculate that atrophin 1 may act as a transcriptional co-repressor. A transcriptional co-repressor is a protein that interacts with other DNA-binding proteins to suppress the activity of certain genes, although it cannot attach (bind) to DNA by itself.One region of the ATN1 gene contains a particular DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (cytosine, adenine, and guanine) that appear multiple times in a row. In most people, the number of CAG repeats in the ATN1 gene ranges from 6 to 35.","Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) results from an increased number of copies (expansion) of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the ATN1 gene. In people with this condition, the CAG segment is abnormally repeated at least 48 times, and the repeat region may be two or three times its usual length. Although the extended CAG region changes the structure of atrophin 1, it is unclear how the altered protein damages brain cells. Researchers believe that abnormal atrophin 1 accumulates in neurons and interferes with normal cell functions. The dysfunction and eventual death of neurons in many parts of the brain lead to involuntary movements, intellectual decline, and the other characteristic features of DRPLA. "
137,ATP1A1 ,ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit alpha 1,"The ATP1A1 gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha-1 subunit) of a protein pump known as a Na+/K+ ATPase. This protein uses energy from a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to transport charged atoms (ions) into and out of cells. Specifically, the protein pumps sodium ions (Na+) out of cells and potassium ions (K+) into cells.Na+/K+ ATPases that include the alpha-1 subunit are found in many types of cells, although the pumps appear to play a particularly important role in the adrenal glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. In the adrenal glands, the flow of sodium and potassium ions helps regulate the production of the hormone aldosterone, which controls blood pressure by maintaining proper salt and fluid levels in the body.","Aldosterone-producing adenoma Mutations in the ATP1A1 gene have been found to cause aldosterone-producing adenomas, which are noncancerous (benign) tumors that form in the adrenal glands. The genetic changes involved in these tumors, called somatic mutations, are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in adrenal gland cells that give rise to the tumor. Changes in the ATP1A1 gene account for approximately six percent of cases of aldosterone-producing adenoma.ATP1A1 gene mutations impair the Na+/K+ ATPase's normal function. The abnormal pumps allow sodium or hydrogen (H+) ions to enter the cell. The abnormal flow of these ions increases aldosterone production, resulting in excess aldosterone and leading to high blood pressure (hypertension) and an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Changes in adrenal gland cells due to impaired Na+/K+ ATPase function also increase cell growth and division (proliferation), which promotes adenoma formation. "
138,ATP1A2 ,ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit alpha 2,"The ATP1A2 gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha-2 subunit) of a protein known as a Na+/K+ ATPase. This protein uses energy from a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to transport charged atoms (ions) into and out of cells. Specifically, it pumps sodium ions (Na+) out of cells and potassium ions (K+) into cells.Na+/K+ ATPases that include the alpha-2 subunit are primarily found in nervous system cells called glia, which protect and maintain nerve cells (neurons). Through its action in glia, the protein plays a critical role in the normal function of neurons. Communication between neurons depends on chemicals called neurotransmitters. To relay signals, a neuron releases neurotransmitters, which attach to receptor proteins on neighboring neurons. After the neurotransmitters have had their effect, they detach from their receptors and are removed from the spaces between neurons by glia. This process is carefully regulated to ensure that signals are transmitted accurately throughout the nervous system. The Na+/K+ ATPase helps regulate this process by stimulating glia to clear neurotransmitters from the spaces between neurons. This protein also removes excess potassium ions from these spaces.","Alternating hemiplegia of childhood At least one mutation in the ATP1A2 gene can cause alternating hemiplegia of childhood. The primary feature of this condition is recurrent episodes of temporary paralysis, often affecting one side of the body (hemiplegia). During some episodes, the paralysis alternates from one side to the other or affects both sides of the body at the same time. The known ATP1A2 gene mutation associated with this condition replaces a single protein building block (amino acid) in Na+/K+ ATPase: the amino acid threonine is replaced with the amino acid asparagine at protein position 378 (written as Thr378Asn or T378N). This genetic change probably impairs the protein's ability to transport ions, although it is unclear how the mutation leads to the specific features of alternating hemiplegia of childhood. "
139,ATP1A3 ,ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit alpha 3,"The ATP1A3 gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha-3 subunit) of a protein known as Na+/K+ ATPase or the sodium pump. This protein uses energy from a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to transport charged atoms (ions) into and out of cells. Specifically, it pumps sodium ions (Na+) out of cells and potassium ions (K+) into cells.Na+/K+ ATPases that include the alpha-3 subunit are primarily found in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and are critical for their normal function. The movement of sodium and potassium ions helps regulate the electrical activity of these cells and plays an important role in the signaling process that controls muscle movement. The activity of Na+/K+ ATPase also helps regulate cell size (volume).Additionally, Na+/K+ ATPase helps regulate a process called neurotransmitter reuptake. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that transmit signals from one neuron to another. After a neurotransmitter has had its effect, it must be removed quickly from the space between the neurons. The reuptake of neurotransmitters is carefully controlled to ensure that signals are sent and received accurately throughout the nervous system.","Alternating hemiplegia of childhood Mutations in the ATP1A3 gene are the primary cause of a neurological condition called alternating hemiplegia of childhood; at least 25 ATP1A3 gene mutations have been found in affected individuals. This condition is characterized by recurrent episodes of temporary paralysis, often affecting one side of the body (hemiplegia). During some episodes, the paralysis alternates from one side to the other or affects both sides of the body at the same time.Most ATP1A3 gene mutations associated with alternating hemiplegia of childhood change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the alpha-3 subunit of Na+/K+ ATPase. These genetic changes appear to impair the pump's ability to transport ions, although it is unclear how the mutations lead to the specific features of alternating hemiplegia of childhood. "
140,ATP2A1 ,ATPase sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transporting 1,"The ATP2A1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase 1 (SERCA1). This enzyme belongs to a family of ATPase enzymes that help control the level of positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) inside cells. The SERCA1 enzyme is found in skeletal muscle cells. (Skeletal muscles are the muscles used for movement.) Within muscle cells, the SERCA1 enzyme is located in the membrane of a structure called the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This structure plays a major role in muscle contraction and relaxation by storing and releasing calcium ions. When calcium ions are transported out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, muscles contract; when calcium ions are transported into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, muscles relax. The SERCA1 enzyme transports calcium ions from the cell into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, triggering muscle relaxation.","Brody myopathy At least 10 mutations in the ATP2A1 gene have been found to cause Brody myopathy, a muscle disorder characterized by muscle cramping after exercise. Most ATP2A1 gene mutations lead to a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the SERCA1 enzyme, resulting in a nonfunctional enzyme. Other mutations lead to the production of a SERCA1 enzyme with decreased function. As a result, calcium ions are slow to enter the sarcoplasmic reticulum and muscle relaxation is delayed. After exercise or other strenuous activity, during which the muscles rapidly contract and relax, people with Brody myopathy develop muscle cramps because their muscles cannot fully relax. Scientists believe that other proteins or other pathways may function in the absence of a fully functional SERCA1 enzyme to transport calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and help with muscle relaxation. "
141,ATP2A2 ,ATPase sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transporting 2,"The ATP2A2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase 2 (SERCA2). This enzyme belongs to a family of ATPase enzymes that helps control the level of positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) inside cells. Within the cell, SERCA2 is found in the endoplasmic reticulum and a related structure in muscle cells called the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum is a structure inside the cell that is involved in protein processing and transport. The sarcoplasmic reticulum assists with muscle contraction and relaxation by releasing and storing calcium ions. Calcium ions act as signals for a large number of activities that are important for the normal development and function of cells. SERCA2 allows calcium ions to pass into and out of the cell in response to cell signals.",Darier disease More than 130 mutations in the ATP2A2 gene have been found to cause Darier disease. Most of these mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the SERCA2 enzyme. All mutations cause the production of a nonfunctional SERCA2 enzyme or cause no SERCA2 to be produced from one copy of the gene. Cells with only one functional copy of the ATP2A2 gene produce half the normal amount of SERCA2 protein. It is thought that insufficient amounts of SERCA2 combined with outside factors such as heat and minor injury cause the signs and symptoms of Darier disease. 
142,ATP2C1 ,ATPase secretory pathway Ca2+ transporting 1,"The ATP2C1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called hSPCA1. This protein is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-powered calcium pump, which uses energy from ATP molecules to pump charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) across cell membranes. Specifically, the hSPCA1 protein transports calcium ions into a cell structure called the Golgi apparatus, where they are stored until needed. The appropriate storage and release of calcium is essential for many cell activities, including cell growth and division, cell movement, and attachment of cells to one another (cell adhesion).The hSPCA1 protein also transports manganese ions into the Golgi apparatus. Manganese works with a variety of enzymes and is involved in processing newly formed proteins.The hSPCA1 protein is present in cells throughout the body. It appears to be particularly important for the normal function of cells called keratinocytes, which are found in the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis).","Benign chronic pemphigus More than 100 mutations in the ATP2C1 gene have been found to cause benign chronic pemphigus, a rare skin condition characterized by red, raw, and blistered areas of skin. Mutations in this gene reduce the amount of functional hSPCA1 protein, which impairs the storage of calcium ions in the Golgi apparatus. For unknown reasons, this abnormal calcium storage affects keratinocytes more than other types of cells. Problems with calcium regulation impair many cell functions, including cell adhesion. As a result, keratinocytes do not stick tightly to one another, which causes the epidermis to become fragile and less resistant to minor trauma. Because the skin is easily damaged, it develops raw, blistered areas, particularly in skin folds where there is moisture and friction.Although ATP2C1 gene mutations probably also affect the transport of manganese within cells, abnormal manganese regulation is not thought to contribute to the signs and symptoms of benign chronic pemphigus. "
143,ATP6V0A2 ,ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit a2,"The ATP6V0A2 gene provides instructions for making one part, the a2 subunit, of a large protein complex (a group of proteins that work together). This protein complex is known as a vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase). A V-ATPase acts as a pump to move positively charged hydrogen atoms (protons) across cell membranes.V-ATPases are embedded in the membranes surrounding cells, where they transport protons into and out of cells. This movement of protons helps regulate the relative acidity (pH) of cells and their surrounding environment. Tight control of pH is necessary for most biological reactions to proceed properly.Within cells, V-ATPases help regulate the pH of particular cell compartments. These compartments include endosomes and lysosomes, which digest and recycle materials that the cell no longer needs. Studies suggest that V-ATPases are also involved in the movement (trafficking) of small sac-like structures called vesicles. Vesicles transport many types of molecules within cells.V-ATPases also play a key role in a complex process called glycosylation, in which proteins are modified by adding sugar molecules. Glycosylation is necessary for the normal function of many different kinds of proteins. V-ATPases regulate the pH of a cellular structure called the Golgi apparatus, where glycosylation occurs.","Cutis laxa At least 18 mutations in the ATP6V0A2 gene have been identified in people with cutis laxa. ATP6V0A2 mutations cause a form of the disorder called autosomal recessive cutis laxa type II, which is characterized by loose, sagging skin and distinctive facial features. Some affected individuals also have delayed development, intellectual disability, seizures, and problems with movement that can worsen over time.Mutations in the ATP6V0A2 gene prevent the cell from producing a functional a2 subunit, which disrupts the normal function of V-ATPases. It is unclear how these genetic changes cause the signs and symptoms of cutis laxa. Researchers suspect that changes in V-ATPase function may disrupt the normal glycosylation of proteins, including several that are involved in the assembly and maintenance of elastic fibers. Elastic fibers are slender bundles of proteins that provide strength and flexibility to connective tissue (tissue that supports the body's joints and organs). People with cutis laxa have a reduced density of elastic fibers, which weakens connective tissue in the skin, lungs, and other organs. These defects in connective tissue underlie many of the major features of the disorder. "
144,ATP6V0A4 ,ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit a4,"The ATP6V0A4 gene provides instructions for making a part (subunit) of a large protein complex known as vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase). V-ATPases are a group of similar complexes that act as pumps to move positively charged hydrogen atoms (protons) across membranes. Because acids are substances that can ""donate"" protons to other molecules, this movement of protons helps regulate the relative acidity (pH) of cells and their surrounding environment. Tight control of pH is necessary for most biological reactions to proceed properly.The V-ATPase that includes the subunit produced from the ATP6V0A4 gene is found in the inner ear and in nephrons, which are the functional structures within the kidneys. The kidneys filter waste products from the blood and remove them in urine. They also reabsorb needed nutrients and release them back into the blood. Each nephron consists of two parts: a renal corpuscle (also known as a glomerulus) that filters the blood, and a renal tubule that reabsorbs substances that are needed and eliminates unneeded substances in urine. The V-ATPase is involved in regulating the amount of acid that is removed from the blood into the urine, and also in maintaining the proper pH of the fluid in the inner ear (endolymph).","Renal tubular acidosis with deafness Several ATP6V0A4 gene mutations have been identified in people with renal tubular acidosis with deafness, a disorder involving excess acid in the blood (metabolic acidosis), bone weakness, and hearing loss caused by changes in the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss).Mutations in the ATP6V0A4 gene impair the function of the V-ATPase proton pump. As a result, the kidneys are less able to control the acidity of the blood, which leads to bone weakness caused by loss of bone minerals (demineralization) and other consequences of metabolic acidosis. The body's capability to control the pH of the fluid in the inner ear is also impaired, resulting in sensorineural hearing loss. "
145,ATP6V1B1 ,ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit B1,"The ATP6V1B1 gene provides instructions for making a part (subunit) of a large protein complex known as vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase). V-ATPases are a group of similar complexes that act as pumps to move positively charged hydrogen atoms (protons) across membranes. Because acids are substances that can ""donate"" protons to other molecules, this movement of protons helps regulate the relative acidity (pH) of cells and their surrounding environment.

The body's capability to control the pH of the fluid in the inner ear is also impaired, resulting in sensorineural hearing loss. "
146,ATP7A ,ATPase copper transporting alpha,"The ATP7A gene provides instructions for making a protein that is important for regulating copper levels in the body. Copper is necessary for many cellular functions, but it is toxic when present in excessive amounts. The ATP7A protein is found throughout the body, except in liver cells. In the small intestine, this protein helps control the absorption of copper from food. In other cells, the ATP7A protein has a dual role and shuttles between two cellular locations. The protein normally resides in a cell structure called the Golgi apparatus, which modifies newly produced proteins, including enzymes. In the Golgi apparatus, the ATP7A protein supplies copper to certain enzymes that are critical for the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels, and the nervous system. If copper levels in the cell environment are elevated, however, the ATP7A protein moves to the cell membrane and eliminates excess copper from the cell.","Cutis laxa Several mutations in the ATP7A gene are responsible for a condition called occipital horn syndrome or X-linked cutis laxa, which is considered a mild form of Menkes syndrome. Occipital horn syndrome is characterized by loose and sagging skin, wedge-shaped calcium deposits in a bone at the base of the skull (the occipital bone), coarse hair, and loose joints.Most of the mutations that cause occipital horn syndrome reduce but do not eliminate the production of the ATP7A protein. A shortage of this protein impairs the absorption of copper from food and prevents its normal distribution to cells throughout the body. The decreased supply of copper can reduce the activity of numerous copper-containing enzymes, affecting the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels, and the nervous system. The reduced activity of these enzymes underlies the characteristic features of occipital horn syndrome. "
147,ATP7B ,ATPase copper transporting beta,"The ATP7B gene provides instructions for making a protein called copper-transporting ATPase 2. This protein is part of the P-type ATPase family, a group of proteins that transport metals into and out of cells by using energy stored in the molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Copper-transporting ATPase 2 is found primarily in the liver, with smaller amounts in the kidneys and brain. It plays a role in the transport of copper from the liver to other parts of the body. Copper is an important part of certain enzymes that maintain normal cell functions. Copper-transporting ATPase 2 is also important for the removal of excess copper from the body.Within liver cells, copper-transporting ATPase 2 is found in a structure called the Golgi apparatus, which modifies newly produced enzymes and other proteins. Here, copper-transporting ATPase 2 supplies copper to a protein called ceruloplasmin, which transports copper to other parts of the body via the blood. If copper levels in the liver get too high, copper-transporting ATPase 2 leaves the Golgi and transfers copper to small sacs (vesicles) for elimination through bile. Bile is a substance produced by the liver that is important for digestion and the removal of waste products.","Wilson disease Researchers have identified more than 250 ATP7B gene mutations that cause Wilson disease. About half the mutations change one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make copper-transporting ATPase 2. This type of mutation alters the 3-dimensional structure of the protein or its stability, preventing copper-transporting ATPase 2 from functioning properly. A common amino acid substitution replaces the amino acid histidine with the amino acid glutamine at position 1069 in the protein (written as His1069Gln or H1069Q). This particular mutation occurs in nearly 40 percent of affected individuals with a Northern or Eastern European ancestry. Approximately one-third of Asians with Wilson disease have a mutation that replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid leucine at position 778 (written as Arg778Leu or R778L). In the Costa Rican population, more than 60 percent of affected individuals have a mutation that replaces the amino acid aspartic acid with the amino acid serine at position 1270 (written as Asp1270Ser or D1270S).Other types of mutations delete or insert small segments of DNA within the ATP7B gene or introduce a stop signal in the gene's instructions for making copper-transporting ATPase 2. As a result, no protein is produced, or an abnormally small protein is made. These types of mutations usually result in symptoms that are more severe than those caused by mutations that change a single amino acid.With a shortage of functional protein, removal of excess copper from the body is impaired. As a result, copper accumulates to toxic levels that can damage tissues and organs, particularly the liver and brain. "
148,ATP8B1 ,ATPase phospholipid transporting 8B1,"The ATP8B1 gene (also known as FIC1) provides instructions for making a protein that is found throughout the body. It is thought to control the distribution of certain fat molecules known as aminophospholipids on the inner surface of liver cell membranes. Based on this role, the ATP8B1 protein is sometimes known as an aminophospholipid translocase. In particular, this protein performs its function in the membranes of liver cells that transport fat-digesting acids called bile acids into bile, and it likely plays a role in maintaining an appropriate balance of bile acids. This process, known as bile acid homeostasis, is critical for the normal secretion of bile and the proper functioning of liver cells.","Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis Mutations in the ATP8B1 gene can cause benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (BRIC1). People with BRIC1 have occasional episodes of impaired bile secretion that lead to severe itching (pruritus), and yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). Most ATP8B1 gene mutations that cause BRIC1 change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ATP8B1 protein. These mutations likely alter the structure or function of the ATP8B1 protein only moderately. Through unknown mechanisms, mutations in the ATP8B1 gene result in the buildup of bile acids in liver cells, which leads to the signs and symptoms of BRIC1. It is unclear what causes the episodes to begin or end. On occasion, people with BRIC1 have been later diagnosed with a more severe condition called progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (described below) when their symptoms worsened. "
149,ATRX ,"ATRX, chromatin remodeler","The ATRX gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an essential role in normal development. Although the specific function of the ATRX protein is unknown, studies suggest that it helps regulate the activity (expression) of other genes through a process known as chromatin remodeling. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and protein that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. Chromatin remodeling is one way gene expression is regulated during development. When DNA is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when DNA is loosely packed.The ATRX protein appears to regulate the expression of two genes, HBA1 and HBA2, that are necessary for the production of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells throughout the body. Other genes regulated by the ATRX protein have not been identified.","Alpha thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability syndrome More than 125 mutations in the ATRX gene have been identified in people with alpha thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability syndrome. The most common mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ATRX protein. Other mutations insert or delete genetic material in the ATRX gene or alter how the gene's instructions are used to make the protein.Mutations may destabilize the ATRX protein or affect its interactions with other proteins. These changes prevent the ATRX protein from effectively regulating gene expression. Reduced activity of the HBA1 and HBA2 genes causes a blood disorder called alpha thalassemia. Abnormal expression of additional genes likely causes developmental delay, distinctive facial features, and the other signs and symptoms of alpha thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability syndrome. "
150,ATXN1 ,ataxin 1,"The ATXN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ataxin-1. This protein is found throughout the body, but its function is unknown. Within cells, ataxin-1 is located in the nucleus. Researchers believe that ataxin-1 may be involved in regulating various aspects of producing proteins, including the first stage of protein production (transcription) and processing RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA.One region of the ATXN1 gene contains a DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (cytosine, adenine, and guanine) that appear multiple times in a row. Normally, the CAG segment is repeated 4 to 39 times within the gene.","Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement. SCA1 results from a mutation in the ATXN1 gene known as a trinucleotide repeat expansion. This mutation increases the length of the repeated CAG segment in the ATXN1 gene. People with SCA1 have from 40 to more than 80 CAG repeats in most cells.The expanded CAG segment leads to the production of an abnormally long version of the ataxin-1 protein that folds into the wrong 3-dimensional shape. This abnormal protein clusters with other proteins to form clumps (aggregates) within the nucleus of cells. These aggregates prevent the ataxin-1 protein from functioning normally, which damages cells. For reasons that are unclear, aggregates of ataxin-1 are found only in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). Certain brain cells called Purkinje cells seem to be particularly sensitive to the accumulation of these aggregates. Purkinje cells are located in the part of the brain that coordinates movement (cerebellum) and are involved in chemical signaling between nerve cells (neurons). The accumulation of protein aggregates in the cells of the central nervous system, particularly in Purkinje cells, leads to cell death. Over time, the loss of these cells causes the movement problems characteristic of SCA1. "
151,ATXN2 ,ataxin 2,"The ATXN2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ataxin-2. This protein is found throughout the body, but its function is unknown. Ataxin-2 is found in the fluid inside cells (cytoplasm) and seems to interact with a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum is involved in protein production, processing, and transport. Researchers believe that ataxin-2 may be involved in processing RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. Ataxin-2 is also thought to play a role in the translation of genetic information to produce proteins.One region of the ATXN2 gene contains a DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (cytosine, adenine, and guanine) that appear multiple times in a row. Normally, the CAG segment is repeated approximately 22 times within the gene.","Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement. SCA2 results from a mutation in the ATXN2 gene known as a trinucleotide repeat expansion. This mutation increases the length of the repeated CAG segment in the ATXN2 gene. People with 32 or more repeats CAG repeats in the ATXN2 gene develop SCA2.It is unclear how the abnormally long CAG segment affects the function of the ataxin-2 protein. The abnormal protein apparently leads to cell death, as people with SCA2 show a loss of brain cells. Certain brain cells called Purkinje cells seem to be particularly sensitive to the presence of abnormal ataxin-2. Purkinje cells are located in the part of the brain that coordinates movement (cerebellum) and are involved in chemical signaling between nerve cells (neurons). It is unknown how the abnormal ataxin-2 protein leads to the death of Purkinje and other brain cells. Over time, the loss of these cells causes the movement problems characteristic of SCA2. "
152,ATXN3 ,ataxin 3,"The ATXN3 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called ataxin-3, which is found in cells throughout the body. Ataxin-3 is involved in a mechanism called the ubiquitin-proteasome system that destroys and gets rid of excess or damaged proteins. The molecule ubiquitin attaches (binds) to unneeded proteins and tags them to be broken down (degraded) within cells. Ataxin-3 removes (cleaves) the ubiquitin from these unwanted proteins just before they are degraded so that the ubiquitin can be used again. Due to its role in cleaving ubiquitin from proteins, ataxin-3 is known as a deubiquitinating enzyme.Researchers believe that ataxin-3 also may be involved in regulating the first stage of protein production (transcription).","Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement. SCA3 results from a mutation in the ATXN3 gene known as a trinucleotide repeat expansion. This mutation increases the length of the repeated CAG segment in the ATXN3 gene. People with SCA3 have more than 50 CAG repeats.The expanded CAG segment leads to the production of an abnormally long version of the ataxin-3 protein that folds into the wrong 3-dimensional shape. This nonfunctional ataxin-3 protein cannot remove ubiquitin from proteins that are no longer needed. As a result, these unwanted proteins, along with ubiquitin and ataxin-3, cluster together to form clumps (aggregates) within the nucleus of the cells. It is unclear how these aggregates affect cell function, because they are found in healthy cells as well as those that die.Nerve cells (neurons) and other types of brain cells are most affected by mutations in the ATXN3 gene. SCA3 is associated with cell death in the part of the brain that is connected to the spinal cord (the brainstem), the part of the brain involved in coordinating movements (the cerebellum), and other areas of the brain. This condition is also associated with the death of neurons in the spinal cord. Over time, the loss of cells in the brain and spinal cord cells cause the signs and symptoms characteristic of SCA3. "
153,AUH ,AU RNA binding methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase,"The AUH gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase. This enzyme is found in cell structures called mitochondria, which convert energy from food into a form that cells can use. Within mitochondria, this enzyme plays an important role in breaking down proteins into smaller molecules that cells can use to produce energy. Specifically, 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase is responsible for the fifth step in breaking down the protein building block (amino acid) leucine. The enzyme converts a molecule called 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA into another molecule called 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA.3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase also has the ability to attach (bind) to RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. Researchers are working to determine the purpose of this RNA-binding ability.","3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency At least 11 mutations in the AUH gene have been found to cause 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency. This condition causes neurological problems such as movement disorders and problems with thinking ability (cognition). The mutations that cause this condition lead to an absence of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase enzyme activity. Without any functional 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase, the breakdown of leucine is incomplete. As a result, 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA is diverted into an alternative pathway and broken down into multiple acids: 3-methylglutaconic acid, 3-methylglutaric acid, and 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid. These acids accumulate in the body's fluids, causing elevated levels of acid in the blood (metabolic acidosis) and release of large amounts of these acids in urine (aciduria). Researchers speculate that an accumulation of these acids in the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord (the cerebrospinal fluid or CSF) can damage these structures and contribute to the neurological features of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency. "
154,AURKC ,aurora kinase C,"The AURKC gene provides instructions for making a protein called aurora kinase C. This protein regulates certain events during cell division. Cell division occurs when a cell replicates and splits its contents, separating into two new cells. Aurora kinase C helps the two dividing cells separate from each other and ensures that these cells each contain a complete set of chromosomes. Aurora kinase C is most abundant in male testes, which are the male reproductive organs in which sperm are produced and stored. In the testes, this protein regulates the division of sperm cells, ensuring that every new sperm cell divides properly and contains one copy of each chromosome.","Macrozoospermia At least four mutations in the AURKC gene have been found to cause macrozoospermia. This condition causes males to have abnormal sperm, which leads to an inability to father biological children (infertility). AURKC gene mutations that cause macrozoospermia lead to the production of a nonfunctional protein or a protein that is quickly broken down. One mutation that is a frequent cause of this condition in men of North African descent deletes a single DNA building block (nucleotide) from the AURKC gene (written 144delC). The protein produced from the altered gene is abnormally short and nonfunctional.A lack of aurora kinase C blocks cell division in sperm cells. As a result, sperm cells have extra chromosomes, usually four copies of each instead of the usual one. This increase in chromosome number enlarges the sperm cell head and leads to the presence of multiple tails (flagella). Because of the additional genetic material, if one of these abnormal sperm cells combines with an egg cell, the embryo will not develop or the pregnancy will result in miscarriage. "
155,AVP ,arginine vasopressin,"The AVP gene provides instructions for making a hormone called vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH starts out as a larger molecule called a preprohormone, which is cut (cleaved) and modified to produce the active hormone and several related proteins. The preprohormone is made in a region of the brain called the hypothalamus. It is then transported to the nearby pituitary gland, where active ADH is stored until it is needed.The major function of ADH is to help control the body's water balance by determining how much water is excreted in urine. Normally, when a person's fluid intake is low or when a lot of fluid is lost (for example, through sweating), the pituitary gland releases more ADH into the bloodstream. High levels of this hormone direct the kidneys to reabsorb more water and to make less urine. When fluid intake is adequate, the pituitary gland releases less ADH. Lower levels of this hormone cause the kidneys to reabsorb less water and to make more urine.","Neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus At least 60 mutations in the AVP gene have been found to cause neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the preprohormone or result in the production of an abnormally short version of this molecule. Studies suggest that the altered preprohormone becomes trapped inside the cells where it is produced instead of being transported to the pituitary gland. As the defective molecule builds up over time, it damages and ultimately kills these cells. The resulting shortage of ADH prevents the kidneys from reabsorbing water as they should, and the body makes excessive amounts of urine. These problems with water balance are characteristic of neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus. "
156,AVPR2 ,arginine vasopressin receptor 2,"The AVPR2 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as the vasopressin V2 receptor. This receptor works together with a hormone called vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in the kidneys. The vasopressin V2 receptor is found in structures called collecting ducts, which are a series of small tubes that reabsorb water from the kidneys into the bloodstream.The interaction between ADH and the vasopressin V2 receptor triggers chemical reactions that control the body's water balance. When a person's fluid intake is low or when a lot of fluid is lost (for example, through sweating), the body produces more ADH. This hormone attaches (binds) to the vasopressin V2 receptor and directs the kidneys to concentrate urine by reabsorbing some of the water back into the bloodstream. When fluid intake is adequate, less ADH is available to interact with the vasopressin V2 receptor. At these times, less water is reabsorbed into the bloodstream and the urine is more dilute.","Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus More than 200 mutations in the AVPR2 gene have been identified in people with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Most of these mutations cause the vasopressin V2 receptor protein to be misfolded into an incorrect 3-dimensional shape. The misfolded protein is trapped within the cell, where it is unable to reach the cell surface to interact with ADH. Less common mutations in the AVPR2 gene prevent the production of any vasopressin V2 receptor protein or lead to a version of the protein that reaches the cell surface but cannot partner with ADH.Without functional vasopressin V2 receptors, the kidneys are unable to respond to signals from ADH. As a result, collecting ducts do not reabsorb water as they should, and the body makes excessive amounts of urine. These problems with water balance are characteristic of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. "
157,B3GLCT ,beta 3-glucosyltransferase,"The B3GLCT gene (formerly known as B3GALTL) provides instructions for making an enzyme called beta 3-glucosyltransferase (B3Glc-T), which is involved in the complex process of adding sugar molecules to proteins (glycosylation). Glycosylation modifies proteins so they can perform a wider variety of functions. The B3Glc-T enzyme is involved in a two-step glycosylation pathway that results in the formation of a sugar structure, made up of the sugars fucose and glucose, on a specific location of several different proteins. The B3Glc-T enzyme is responsible for the second step, which adds a glucose molecule to the fucose molecule already attached to the protein. The B3GLCT gene is normally turned on (active) in most cells of the body, which suggests that the B3Glc-T enzyme plays an important role across many cell types.","Peters plus syndrome At least 10 mutations that cause Peters plus syndrome have been identified in the B3GLCT gene. Peters plus syndrome is characterized by eye abnormalities, short stature, intellectual disability, and distinctive facial features. The most common B3GLCT gene mutation replaces the DNA building block (nucleotide) guanine with the nucleotide adenine near an area of the gene called exon 8 (written as 660+1G>A). This mutation disrupts how genetic information is pieced together to produce the B3Glc-T enzyme. The resulting enzyme is abnormally short and nonfunctional. It is unclear how the loss of functional B3Glc-T enzyme leads to the signs and symptoms of Peters plus syndrome, but impaired glycosylation likely disrupts the function of many proteins, which may contribute to the variety of features. "
158,BAP1 ,BRCA1 associated protein 1,"The BAP1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase BAP1 (shortened to BAP1). This protein functions as a deubiquitinase, which means it removes a molecule called ubiquitin from certain proteins. The presence of ubiquitin molecules on a protein can affect the activity of the protein and its interactions with other proteins. The ubiquitin ""tag"" also promotes breakdown (degradation) of a protein. By removing ubiquitin, BAP1 helps regulate the function of many proteins involved in diverse cellular processes. The BAP1 protein is thought to help control cell growth and division (proliferation) and cell death. Studies suggest that it is involved in the progression of cells through the step-by-step process they take to replicate themselves (called the cell cycle) and that it plays roles in repairing damaged DNA and controlling the activity of genes.Although the exact mechanism is unclear, the BAP1 protein acts as a tumor suppressor. Tumor suppressor proteins help prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.","BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome Mutations in the BAP1 gene cause BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome. People with this condition have an increased risk of developing many types of noncancerous (benign) and cancerous (malignant) tumors, particularly certain tumors of the skin (atypical Spitz tumors, cutaneous melanoma, and basal cell carcinoma); eyes (uveal melanoma); kidneys (clear cell renal cell carcinoma); and a tissue called the mesothelium that lines the chest, abdomen, and internal organs (malignant mesothelioma). Researchers are still determining whether other forms of cancer are linked to BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome.Affected individuals inherit a mutation in one copy of the BAP1 gene. These mutations, which are present in essentially every cell of the body, are classified as germline mutations. Most germline BAP1 gene mutations lead to an abnormally short BAP1 protein that is likely broken down prematurely. Other germline mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the BAP1 protein and likely impair its function. In most cases, a second, non-inherited (somatic) mutation occurs in the normal copy of the gene in cells that give rise to tumors. Together, the germline and somatic mutations lead to a loss of BAP1 protein function in tumor cells.Reduction or loss of this protein's function likely prevents the removal of ubiquitin molecules from certain proteins. Although it is unclear exactly how changes in BAP1 function lead to BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome, researchers speculate that altered activity of proteins normally regulated by BAP1 deubiquitination may promote cell proliferation or survival, resulting in tumor formation. "
159,BBS1 ,Bardet-Biedl syndrome 1,"The BBS1 gene provides instructions for making a protein found in cells throughout the body. The BBS1 protein is part of a group (complex) of proteins that plays a critical role in the formation of cell structures called cilia. Cilia are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of many types of cells. They are involved in cell movement and many different chemical signaling pathways. Cilia are also necessary for the perception of sensory input (such as sight, hearing, and smell).","Bardet-Biedl syndrome More than 30 mutations in the BBS1 gene have been identified in people with Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Mutations in this gene are the most common cause of Bardet-Biedl syndrome, accounting for about one-quarter of all cases.Most BBS1 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the BBS1 protein or lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the protein. The most common mutation replaces the amino acid methionine with the amino acid arginine at protein position 390 (written as Met390Arg or M390R).Mutations in the BBS1 gene likely affect the normal formation and function of cilia. Defects in these cell structures probably disrupt important chemical signaling pathways during development and lead to abnormalities of sensory perception. Researchers believe that defective cilia are responsible for most of the features of Bardet-Biedl syndrome, including vision loss, obesity, the presence of extra fingers and/or toes (polydactyly), kidney abnormalities, and intellectual disability. "
160,BBS10 ,Bardet-Biedl syndrome 10,"The BBS10 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in many types of cells. The BBS10 protein is part of a group (complex) of proteins that functions as a chaperonin. Chaperonins help fold other proteins into their correct 3-dimensional shapes so they can perform their usual functions in the body.Studies suggest that the BBS10 protein helps fold or stabilize certain proteins that are necessary for the normal formation of cilia. Cilia are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of many types of cells. They are involved in cell movement and many different chemical signaling pathways. Cilia are also necessary for the perception of sensory input (such as sight, hearing, and smell).","Bardet-Biedl syndrome More than 35 mutations in the BBS10 gene have been found to cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Mutations in this gene account for about 20 percent of all cases of the disorder.Some BBS10 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the BBS10 protein, while other mutations add or delete genetic material in the BBS10 gene. The most common BBS10 gene mutation, which is written as C91fsX95, leads to the production of an abnormally short version of the BBS10 protein.Researchers are studying how mutations in the BBS10 gene lead to the specific features of Bardet-Biedl syndrome. A malfunctioning BBS10 protein appears to affect the normal formation and function of cilia. Defects in these cell structures probably disrupt important chemical signaling pathways during development and lead to abnormalities of sensory perception. Researchers believe that defective cilia are responsible for most of the features of Bardet-Biedl syndrome, including vision loss, obesity, the presence of extra fingers and/or toes (polydactyly), kidney abnormalities, and intellectual disability. "
161,BCHE ,butyrylcholinesterase,"The BCHE gene provides instructions for making the pseudocholinesterase enzyme, also known as butyrylcholinesterase, which is produced by the liver and circulates in the blood. The pseudocholinesterase enzyme is involved in the breakdown of certain drugs, including muscle relaxant drugs called choline esters that are used during general anesthesia. These drugs are given to relax the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles), including the muscles involved in breathing, and are often employed in emergencies when a breathing tube must be inserted quickly.Pseudocholinesterase also helps protect the body by breaking down certain toxic substances before they reach the nerves. These substances include certain pesticides, poisons that attack the nerves, and specific natural toxins including a compound called solanine found in green potato skin. It is likely that the enzyme has other functions in the body, but these functions are not well understood. Studies suggest that the enzyme may be involved in the transmission of nerve signals.","Pseudocholinesterase deficiency More than 50 mutations in the BCHE gene have been identified in people with pseudocholinesterase deficiency, a condition that results in increased sensitivity to choline esters and certain other drugs. Some of these mutations replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the pseudocholinesterase enzyme, resulting in an abnormal enzyme that does not function properly. Other mutations prevent the production of pseudocholinesterase. A lack (deficiency) of functional pseudocholinesterase enzyme impairs the body's ability to break down choline ester drugs efficiently, leading to abnormally prolonged drug effects. "
162,BCKDHA ,"branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase E1, alpha polypeptide","The BCKDHA gene provides instructions for making one part, the alpha subunit, of a group of enzymes called the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD) enzyme complex. Two alpha subunits connect with two beta subunits, which are produced from the BCKDHB gene, to form a critical piece of the enzyme complex called the E1 component.The BCKD enzyme complex is responsible for one step in the normal breakdown of three protein building blocks (amino acids). These amino acids—leucine, isoleucine, and valine—are obtained from the diet. They are present in many kinds of food, particularly protein-rich foods such as milk, meat, and eggs. The BCKD enzyme complex is active in mitochondria, which are specialized structures inside cells that serve as energy-producing centers. The breakdown of leucine, isoleucine, and valine produces molecules that can be used for energy.","Maple syrup urine disease More than 80 mutations in the BCKDHA gene have been identified in people with maple syrup urine disease. These mutations most often cause the severe, classic form of the disorder, which becomes apparent soon after birth. Maple syrup urine disease gets its name from the distinctive sweet odor of affected infants' urine. It is also characterized by poor feeding, vomiting, lack of energy (lethargy), abnormal movements, and delayed development.Most BCKDHA mutations change single amino acids in the alpha subunit of the BCKD enzyme complex. In the Old Order Mennonite population, where maple syrup urine disease occurs frequently, the most common mutation replaces the amino acid tyrosine with the amino acid asparagine at position 438 (written as Tyr438Asn or Y438N).Mutations in the BCKDHA gene disrupt the normal function of the BCKD enzyme complex, preventing it from effectively breaking down leucine, isoleucine, and valine. As a result, these amino acids and their byproducts build up in the body. This accumulation is toxic to cells and tissues, particularly in the nervous system. The buildup of these substances can lead to seizures, developmental delay, and the other health problems associated with maple syrup urine disease. "
163,BCKDHB ,branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase E1 subunit beta,"The BCKDHB gene provides instructions for making one part, the beta subunit, of a group of enzymes called the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD) enzyme complex. Two beta subunits connect with two alpha subunits, which are produced from the BCKDHA gene, to form a critical piece of the enzyme complex called the E1 component.The BCKD enzyme complex is responsible for one step in the normal breakdown of three protein building blocks (amino acids). These amino acids—leucine, isoleucine, and valine—are obtained from the diet. They are present in many kinds of food, particularly protein-rich foods such as milk, meat, and eggs. The BCKD enzyme complex is active in mitochondria, which are specialized structures inside cells that serve as energy-producing centers. The breakdown of leucine, isoleucine, and valine produces molecules that can be used for energy.","Maple syrup urine disease More than 90 mutations in the BCKDHB gene have been identified in people with maple syrup urine disease. These mutations most often cause the severe, classic form of the disorder, which becomes apparent soon after birth. Maple syrup urine disease gets its name from the distinctive sweet odor of affected infants' urine. It is also characterized by poor feeding, vomiting, lack of energy (lethargy), abnormal movements, and delayed development.Most BCKDHB gene mutations change single amino acids in the beta subunit of the BCKD enzyme complex. Other mutations insert or delete small amounts of DNA in the gene. A particular mutation is most common in people of Ashkenazi (eastern and central European) Jewish descent; this mutation replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid proline at position 183 in the beta subunit (written as Arg183Pro or R183P).Mutations in the BCKDHB gene disrupt the normal function of the BCKD enzyme complex, preventing it from effectively breaking down leucine, isoleucine, and valine. As a result, these amino acids and their byproducts build up in the body. This accumulation is toxic to cells and tissues, particularly in the nervous system. The buildup of these substances can lead to seizures, developmental delay, and the other health problems associated with maple syrup urine disease. "
164,BCOR ,BCL6 corepressor,"The BCOR gene provides instructions for making a protein known as the BCL6 corepressor. A corepressor is a protein that cannot attach (bind) to DNA by itself, but interacts with other DNA-binding proteins to suppress the activity of certain genes. In this case, the BCL6 corepressor partners with the DNA-binding protein produced from the BCL6 gene. The BCL6 gene plays an important role in the function and survival of certain immune system cells.Researchers have found that the BCOR gene is active throughout the body, not just in the immune system. This widespread activity suggests that the BCL6 corepressor has other functions in addition to its interaction with the BCL6 protein. The BCL6 corepressor appears to play a critical role in early embryonic development, including the formation of the eyes and several other tissues and organs. Scientists believe that the BCL6 corepressor may also be involved in specifying the left and right sides of the body in the developing embryo.","Lenz microphthalmia syndrome A mutation in the BCOR gene has been found in one family with Lenz microphthalmia syndrome. This mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the BCL6 corepressor, which alters the protein's structure. Specifically, the mutation replaces the amino acid proline with the amino acid leucine at position 85 (written as Pro85Leu). Because the BCL6 corepressor plays an essential role in early development, a defective version of the protein disrupts the normal formation of the eyes and several other organs and tissues before birth.The BCOR gene is on the X chromosome (one of the two sex chromosomes) and the inheritance of Lenz microphthalmia is described as X-linked recessive. X-linked recessive disorders occur much more commonly in males than in females. Lenz microphthalmia syndrome has been found only in males. "
165,BCR ,"BCR, RhoGEF and GTPase activating protein","The BCR gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not completely understood. Studies show that the BCR protein may act as a GTPase activating protein (GAP). GAPs turn off (inactivate) proteins called GTPases, which play an important role in chemical signaling within cells. Often referred to as molecular switches, GTPases can be turned on and off. They are turned on (active) when they are attached (bound) to a molecule called GTP and are turned off when they are bound to another molecule called GDP. The BCR protein inactivates a GTPase known as Rac1 by stimulating a reaction that turns the attached GTP into GDP. Through this activity, the BCR protein helps regulate the movement (migration) and function of cells.The BCR protein can also act as a kinase, which is an enzyme that changes the activity of other proteins by adding a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) at specific positions. BCR's kinase activity is likely involved in regulating signaling within cells, although its exact role is unclear.","Chronic myeloid leukemia A genetic rearrangement (translocation) involving the BCR gene causes a type of cancer of blood-forming cells called chronic myeloid leukemia. This slow-growing cancer leads to an overproduction of abnormal white blood cells. Common features of the condition include excessive tiredness (fatigue), fever, weight loss, and an enlarged spleen.The translocation involved in this condition, written as t(9;22), fuses part of the ABL1 gene from chromosome 9 with part of the BCR gene from chromosome 22, creating an abnormal fusion gene called BCR-ABL1. The abnormal chromosome 22, containing a piece of chromosome 9 and the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, is commonly called the Philadelphia chromosome. The translocation is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in the abnormal blood cells. This type of genetic change, called a somatic mutation, is not inherited.The protein produced from the abnormal fusion gene, called BCR-ABL1, signals for cells to grow and divide and blocks the self-destruction of cells that are abnormal or unneeded. The BCR-ABL1 protein is always turned on, so growth and division of affected blood cells is uncontrolled, leading to overproduction of the abnormal cells.The presence of the Philadelphia chromosome provides a target for molecular therapies. "
166,BCS1L ,"BCS1 homolog, ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex chaperone","The BCS1L gene provides instructions for making a protein that functions in cell structures called mitochondria, which convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. The BCS1L protein is critical for the formation of a group of proteins known as complex III. Specifically, BCS1L adds a component called Rieske Fe/S protein to the complex. In mitochondria, complex III performs one step of the multistep process known as oxidative phosphorylation, in which oxygen and simple sugars are used to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source.As a byproduct of its action in oxidative phosphorylation, complex III produces reactive oxygen species, which are harmful molecules that can damage DNA and tissues. The reactive oxygen species produced by complex III are thought to also play a role in normal cell signaling, particularly when levels of oxygen in the body are low (hypoxia).Some researchers believe the BCS1L protein is involved in the breakdown (metabolism) of iron, although the mechanism is unknown.","Björnstad syndrome At least six BCS1L gene mutations have been found to cause Björnstad syndrome, a condition characterized by a hair abnormality known as pili torti (or ""twisted hair"") and hearing loss. BCS1L gene mutations associated with this condition alter the BCS1L protein and impair its ability to interact with other proteins. These changes reduce BCS1L's ability to add the Rieske Fe/S protein to complex III. As a result, complex III is incomplete, and excess Rieske Fe/S protein builds up in mitochondria. The resulting decrease in complex III activity reduces oxidative phosphorylation to approximately 60 percent of normal.Studies show that in people with Björnstad syndrome, complex III produces little or no reactive oxygen species; however, for unknown reasons, another protein complex involved in oxidative phosphorylation called complex I produces excessive amounts of reactive oxygen species, even more than would be produced by normally functioning complex III. Researchers believe that tissues in the inner ears and hair follicles are particularly sensitive to reactive oxygen species and are damaged by the abnormal amount of these molecules, leading to the characteristic features of Björnstad syndrome. It is unclear if a lack of cellular energy due to the reduction of complex III function also contributes to the features of this condition. "
167,BDNF ,brain derived neurotrophic factor,"The BDNF gene provides instructions for making a protein found in the brain and spinal cord called brain-derived neurotrophic factor. This protein promotes the survival of nerve cells (neurons) by playing a role in the growth, maturation (differentiation), and maintenance of these cells. In the brain, the BDNF protein is active at the connections between nerve cells (synapses), where cell-to-cell communication occurs. The synapses can change and adapt over time in response to experience, a characteristic called synaptic plasticity. The BDNF protein helps regulate synaptic plasticity, which is important for learning and memory.The BDNF protein is found in regions of the brain that control eating, drinking, and body weight; the protein likely contributes to the management of these functions.",Opioid addiction Genetics Home Reference provides information about opioid addiction. 
168,BEST1 ,bestrophin 1,"The BEST1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called bestrophin-1, which appears to play a critical role in normal vision. Bestrophin-1 is found in a thin layer of cells at the back of the eye called the retinal pigment epithelium. This cell layer supports and nourishes the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. The retinal pigment epithelium is involved in the growth and development of the eye, maintenance of the retina, and the normal function of specialized cells called photoreceptors that detect light and color.Bestrophin-1 functions as a channel across cell membranes in the retinal pigment epithelium. Charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions) are transported through these channels in response to cellular signals. Some studies suggest that bestrophin-1 may also help regulate the entry of charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) into cells of the retinal pigment epithelium. Other potential functions of bestrophin-1 are under study.","Vitelliform macular dystrophy More than 100 mutations in the BEST1 gene have been identified in people with vitelliform macular dystrophy. These mutations can cause either the early-onset form of the disorder (known as Best disease) or the adult-onset form. Both types of vitelliform macular dystrophy are characterized by the buildup of a fatty yellow pigment (lipofuscin) in cells of the retinal pigment epithelium. Over time, the abnormal accumulation of this substance can damage the photoreceptors that are critical for sharp central vision.Most BEST1 mutations involved in vitelliform macular dystrophy change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in bestrophin-1. The altered protein probably forms an abnormally shaped channel that cannot properly regulate the flow of chloride ions into or out of cells in the retinal pigment epithelium. It remains unclear how this defect is related to the buildup of lipofuscin and a progressive loss of central vision in people with vitelliform macular dystrophy. "
169,BICD2 ,BICD cargo adaptor 2,"The BICD2 gene provides instructions for making one of a family of proteins called golgins. Golgins help maintain the structure of a cell component called the Golgi apparatus, in which newly produced proteins are modified so they can carry out their functions.The BICD2 protein is found in all cells. The protein attaches (binds) to a group of proteins called the dynein complex, turning it on (activating it) and helping it bind to other cellular materials for transport. During transport, BICD2 stabilizes the dynein complex along a track-like system of small tubes called microtubules, similar to a conveyer belt. The BICD2 protein helps the dynein complex with protein transport, positioning of cell compartments, mobility of structures within the cell, and many other cell processes.In nerve cells (neurons), the BICD2 protein helps the dynein complex transport sac-like structures called synaptic vesicles. These structures contain chemical messengers that allow neighboring cells to communicate with one another.","Spinal muscular atrophy with lower extremity predominance At least six mutations in the BICD2 gene have been found to cause spinal muscular atrophy with lower extremity predominance (SMA-LED). This condition is characterized by muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) in the lower limbs that often begins in infancy or childhood.The BICD2 gene mutations that cause SMA-LED replace single protein building blocks (amino acids). One mutation that has been found in multiple affected individuals and families replaces the amino acid serine with the amino acid leucine at position 107 in the BICD2 protein (written as Ser107Leu or S107L). This change and the other BICD2 gene mutations increase the activity of the BICD2 protein. Overactivity of the BICD2 protein changes its ability to bind with the dynein complex, leading to reduced movement of proteins, synaptic vesicles, and other materials within cells. Decreased synaptic vesicle transport in neurons that control muscle movement (motor neurons), leading to impaired growth of neurons, is thought to contribute to the muscle weakness and atrophy experienced by people with SMA-LED. It is unclear why this condition primarily affects the lower limbs.Additionally, BICD2 gene mutations impair the protein's ability to maintain the structure of the Golgi apparatus within cells. As a result, the Golgi apparatus breaks down into small fragments and the altered BICD2 protein becomes trapped within these fragments. Loss of these cell components likely further contributes to the signs and symptoms of SMA-LED. "
170,BIN1 ,bridging integrator 1,"The BIN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in tissues throughout the body, where it interacts with a variety of other proteins. The BIN1 protein is thought to be involved in the transportation of materials from the cell surface into the cell (endocytosis) and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). The BIN1 protein may act as a tumor suppressor protein, which means it prevents cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.Several different versions (isoforms) of the BIN1 protein are produced from the BIN1 gene. These isoforms vary by size and are active in different tissues. The BIN1 protein isoform that is expressed in muscle cells is thought to be involved in the formation of structures called transverse tubules or T tubules. These structures are found within the membrane of muscle cells, where they play a role in muscle tensing (contraction) and relaxation.","Centronuclear myopathy At least 10 mutations in the BIN1 gene have been found to cause centronuclear myopathy, a condition that is characterized by muscle weakness (myopathy) in the skeletal muscles, which are the muscles used for movement. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the BIN1 protein. BIN1 gene mutations result in the production of a protein that cannot form T tubules. A shortage of T tubules in muscle fibers alters their structure, which prevents them from contracting and relaxing normally. The abnormal muscle fibers underlie the muscle weakness characteristic of centronuclear myopathy. "
171,BLM ,BLM RecQ like helicase,"The BLM gene provides instructions for making a member of a protein family called RecQ helicases. Helicases are enzymes that attach (bind) to DNA and unwind the two spiral strands (double helix) of the DNA molecule. This unwinding is necessary for several processes in the cell nucleus, including copying (replicating) DNA in preparation for cell division and repairing damaged DNA. Because RecQ helicases help maintain the structure and integrity of DNA, they are known as the ""caretakers of the genome.""When a cell prepares to divide to form two cells, the DNA that makes up the chromosomes is copied so that each new cell will have two copies of each chromosome, one from each parent. The copied DNA from each chromosome is arranged into two identical structures, called sister chromatids, which are attached to one another during the early stages of cell division. Sister chromatids occasionally exchange small sections of DNA during this time, a process called sister chromatid exchange. Researchers suggest that these exchanges may be a response to DNA damage during the copying process. The BLM protein helps to prevent excess sister chromatid exchanges and is also involved in other processes that help maintain the stability of the DNA during the copying process.","Bloom syndrome More than 70 BLM gene mutations have been identified in people with Bloom syndrome, an inherited disorder characterized by short stature, a skin rash that develops after exposure to the sun, and a greatly increased risk of cancer. One particular BLM gene mutation causes almost all cases of Bloom syndrome among people of Central and Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish descent. This mutation deletes six DNA building blocks (nucleotides) and replaces them with seven others at position 2281 (written as 2281 delta 6ins7, or blmAsh). The blmAsh mutation results in the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the BLM protein. Other BLM gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the protein sequence or create a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the protein. These mutations also reduce the amount of functional BLM protein.As a result of the lack of functional BLM protein, the frequency of sister chromatid exchange is about 10 times higher than average. Exchange of DNA between chromosomes derived from the individual's mother and father are also increased in people with BLM gene mutations. In addition, chromosome breakage occurs more frequently in affected individuals. All of these changes are associated with gaps and breaks in the genetic material that impair normal cell activities and cause the health problems associated with this condition. Without the BLM protein, the cell is less able to repair DNA damage caused by ultraviolet light, which results in increased sun sensitivity. Genetic changes that allow cells to divide in an uncontrolled way lead to the cancers that occur in people with Bloom syndrome. "
172,BMPR1A ,bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1A,"The BMPR1A gene provides instructions for making a protein called bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1A. This receptor protein has a specific site into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. Specifically, the BMPR1A protein attaches (binds) to ligands in the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) pathway. This signaling pathway allows the environment outside the cell to affect how the cell produces other proteins. The BMPR1A receptor protein and its ligands are involved in transmitting chemical signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus.When the BMPR1A protein is bound to a ligand, it turns on (activates) a group of related proteins (a protein complex) called SMAD proteins. The activated SMAD protein complex is then transported into the cell's nucleus, where it regulates cell growth and division (proliferation) and the activity of particular genes.","Juvenile polyposis syndrome More than 60 mutations in the BMPR1A gene have been found to cause juvenile polyposis syndrome. Most BMPR1A gene mutations result in the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein. As a result, the BMPR1A protein cannot bind to ligands in the TGF-β pathway. This disruption in binding interferes with the activation of the SMAD protein complex. This inactive complex is not transported to the nucleus, where it is needed to regulate cell growth and the activity of certain genes. Unregulated cell growth can lead to polyp formation in people with juvenile polyposis syndrome. "
173,BMPR2 ,bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2,"The BMPR2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2. The BMPR2 gene belongs to a family of genes originally identified for its role in regulating the growth and maturation (differentiation) of bone and cartilage. Recently, researchers have found that this gene family plays a broader role in regulating the growth and differentiation of numerous types of cells.Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 spans the cell membrane, so that one end of the protein is on the outer surface of the cell and the other end remains inside the cell. This positioning allows the protein to receive and transmit signals that help the cell respond to its environment by growing and dividing (cell proliferation) or by undergoing controlled cell death (apoptosis). This balance of cell proliferation and apoptosis regulates the number of cells in tissues.","Pulmonary arterial hypertension Researchers have identified more than 350 BMPR2 gene mutations that can cause pulmonary arterial hypertension, a condition characterized by abnormally high blood pressure (hypertension) in the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs (the pulmonary artery). About half of the mutations involved in this condition disrupt the assembly of bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2, reducing the amount of this protein in cells. Other mutations prevent bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 from reaching the cell surface or alter its structure so it cannot receive or transmit signals.It remains unclear how BMPR2 gene mutations cause pulmonary arterial hypertension. Researchers suggest that a mutation in this gene promotes cell proliferation or prevents cell death, resulting in an overgrowth of cells in the smallest arteries throughout the lungs. As a result, these arteries narrow in diameter, which increases the resistance to blood flow through the lungs. To overcome the increased resistance, blood pressure increases in the pulmonary artery and in the right ventricle of the heart, which is the chamber that pumps blood into the pulmonary artery. Signs and symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension occur when increased blood pressure cannot fully overcome the elevated resistance, and blood flow to the body is insufficient. "
174,BOLA3 ,bolA family member 3,"The BOLA3 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not well understood. The BOLA3 protein is thought to be involved in the formation of molecules called iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters or in the attachment of these clusters to other proteins. Certain proteins require attachment of Fe-S clusters to function properly.Two versions (isoforms) of the BOLA3 protein are produced from the BOLA3 gene. One version is found in cellular structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria are the energy-producing centers of cells. In these structures, several proteins carry out a series of chemical steps to convert the energy in food into a form that cells can use. Many of the proteins involved in this process require Fe-S clusters to function, including protein complexes called complex I, complex II, and complex III.Fe-S clusters are also required for another mitochondrial protein to function; this protein is involved in the modification of additional proteins that aid in energy production in mitochondria, including the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. This modification is also critical to the function of the glycine cleavage system, a set of proteins that breaks down a protein building block (amino acid) called glycine when levels become too high.The other version of the BOLA3 protein is found in the fluid-filled space inside the cell (the cytoplasm). While this protein is likely involved in Fe-S cluster formation in the cytoplasm, the role of this isoform is not well understood.","Multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome At least three mutations in the BOLA3 gene have been found to cause multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome. This severe condition is characterized by impairment of more than one mitochondrial function, such as reduced activity of complex I, II, or III, pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, or the glycine cleavage system. Affected infants often have severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy) and elevated levels of a chemical called lactic acid in the body (lactic acidosis). These babies usually do not survive past infancy.BOLA3 gene mutations lead to production of an altered protein that is likely broken down quickly. Although some mutations affect both isoforms of the BOLA3 protein, loss of the mitochondrial version appears to be responsible for the condition. The lack of mitochondrial BOLA3 protein impairs Fe-S cluster formation. Consequently, proteins affected by the presence of Fe-S clusters, including those involved in energy production and glycine breakdown, cannot function normally. Reduced activity of complex I, II, or III, pyruvate dehydrogenase, or alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase leads to potentially fatal lactic acidosis, encephalopathy, and other signs and symptoms of multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome. In some affected individuals, impairment of the glycine cleavage system leads to a buildup of glycine (hyperglycinemia). "
175,BRAF ,"B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase","The BRAF gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps transmit chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. This protein is part of a signaling pathway known as the RAS/MAPK pathway, which controls several important cell functions. Specifically, the RAS/MAPK pathway regulates the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (migration), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). Chemical signaling through this pathway is essential for normal development before birth.The BRAF gene belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous.","Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome Mutations in the BRAF gene are the most common cause of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. This condition affects many parts of the body, particularly the heart (cardio-), facial features (facio-), and the skin and hair (cutaneous). At least 49 BRAF mutations have been identified in people with this disorder. These mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the BRAF protein. Almost all of these genetic changes abnormally activate the protein, which disrupts the tightly regulated RAS/MAPK signaling pathway in cells throughout the body. The altered signaling interferes with the normal development of many organs and tissues, resulting in the characteristic features of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. "
176,BRCA1 ,"BRCA1, DNA repair associated","The BRCA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that acts as a tumor suppressor. Tumor suppressor proteins help prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.The BRCA1 protein is involved in repairing damaged DNA. In the nucleus of many types of normal cells, the BRCA1 protein interacts with several other proteins to mend breaks in DNA. These breaks can be caused by natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, and they also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material in preparation for cell division. By helping to repair DNA, the BRCA1 protein plays a critical role in maintaining the stability of a cell's genetic information.Research suggests that the BRCA1 protein also regulates the activity of other genes and plays an essential role in embryonic development. To carry out these functions, the BRCA1 protein interacts with many other proteins, including other tumor suppressors and proteins that regulate cell division.","Breast cancer Researchers have identified more than 1,800 mutations in the BRCA1 gene. Many of these mutations are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in both men and women, as well as several other types of cancer. These mutations are present in every cell in the body and can be passed from one generation to the next. As a result, they are associated with cancers that cluster in families. However, not everyone who inherits a mutation in the BRCA1 gene will develop cancer. Other genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors also contribute to a person's cancer risk.Most BRCA1 gene mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the BRCA1 protein or prevent any protein from being made from one copy of the gene. As a result, less of this protein is available to help repair damaged DNA or fix mutations that occur in other genes. As these defects accumulate, they can trigger cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. "
177,BRCA2 ,"BRCA2, DNA repair associated","The BRCA2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that acts as a tumor suppressor. Tumor suppressor proteins help prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.The BRCA2 protein is involved in repairing damaged DNA.

By helping to repair DNA, the BRCA2 protein plays a critical role in maintaining the stability of a cell's genetic information.Researchers suspect that the BRCA2 protein has additional functions within cells. For example, the protein may help regulate cytokinesis, which is the step in cell division when the fluid surrounding the nucleus (the cytoplasm) divides to form two separate cells. Researchers are investigating the protein's other potential activities.","Breast cancer Researchers have identified more than 1,800 mutations in the BRCA2 gene.

178,BSCL2 ,"BSCL2, seipin lipid droplet biogenesis associated","The BSCL2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called seipin, whose function is unknown. Within cells, seipin is located in the membrane of a structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum modifies newly produced proteins and also helps transport proteins, fats, and other molecules to specific sites either inside or outside the cell.The BSCL2 gene is active in cells and tissues throughout the body, particularly in nerve cells that control muscle movement (motor neurons) and in the brain. The gene is also active in fat-storing cells called adipocytes, which are the major component of fatty (adipose) tissue. Studies suggest that seipin plays a critical role in the development and function of adipocytes. In particular, seipin is involved in the development of lipid droplets, which are structures within these cells that store fat molecules.",Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Genetics Home Reference provides information about Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. 
179,BSND ,barttin CLCNK type accessory beta subunit,"The BSND gene provides instructions for making a protein called barttin. This protein is found primarily in the kidneys, where it attaches (binds) to two specific chloride channels: ClC-Ka (produced from the CLCNKA gene) and ClC-Kb (produced from the CLCNKB gene). The ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb channels transport charged atoms of chlorine (chloride ions) out of kidney cells.Barttin is essential for the normal placement of ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb channels in the cell membrane. It also regulates the channels' stability and function. The transport of chloride ions is part of the mechanism by which the kidneys reabsorb salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) from the urine back into the bloodstream. The retention of salt affects the body's fluid levels and helps maintain blood pressure.Barttin, ClC-Ka, and ClC-Kb are also found in the inner ear, where they play a role in normal hearing.","Bartter syndrome More than a dozen mutations in the BSND gene have been identified in people with Bartter syndrome type IV. This form of the disorder causes severe or life-threatening health problems that become apparent before or soon after birth. Affected individuals also have hearing loss caused by abnormalities in the inner ear, which is why Bartter syndrome type IV is also known as antenatal Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness.BSND gene mutations impair barttin's ability to regulate the ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb channels. Some mutations keep the channels from ever reaching the cell membrane. Other mutations allow the channels to reach the cell membrane but prevent them from transporting ions properly. As a result, the kidneys cannot reabsorb salt normally and excess salt is lost through the urine (salt wasting). The abnormal salt loss disrupts the normal balance of ions in the body. This imbalance underlies many of the major features of Bartter syndrome, including a failure to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive), dehydration, constipation, and increased urine production (polyuria). A loss of ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb function in the inner ear is responsible for the hearing loss characteristic of Bartter syndrome type IV. "
180,BTD ,biotinidase,"The BTD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called biotinidase. This enzyme recycles biotin, a B vitamin found in foods such as liver, egg yolks, and milk. Biotinidase removes biotin that is bound to proteins in food, leaving the vitamin in its free (unbound) state. The body needs free biotin to activate enzymes called biotin-dependent carboxylases. These carboxylases are involved in many critical cellular functions, including the breakdown of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.In addition to processing biotin obtained from the diet, biotinidase recycles biotin within the body. As biotin-dependent carboxylases are broken down, they release a molecule called biocytin. Biocytin is a complex made of up biotin and a protein building block (amino acid) called lysine. Biotinidase splits this complex, making free biotin available for reuse by other carboxylase enzymes.Researchers suspect that biotinidase may have several additional functions. This enzyme may transport free biotin through the bloodstream. It might also have the ability to attach biotin to certain proteins through a process called biotinylation. Within the nucleus, biotinylation of DNA-associated proteins called histones may help determine whether certain genes are turned on or off. It is unclear, however, whether biotinidase plays a role in regulating gene activity.","Biotinidase deficiency More than 150 mutations in the BTD gene have been identified in people with biotinidase deficiency. This disorder, if untreated, can affect many parts of the body and cause delayed development. Most of the mutations that cause biotinidase deficiency change single amino acids in the biotinidase enzyme. These changes occur in critical regions of the enzyme and reduce or eliminate the enzyme's activity.Most BTD gene mutations cause profound biotinidase deficiency. This severe form of the disorder results when the activity of biotinidase is reduced to less than 10 percent of normal. Other mutations cause a milder form of the condition called partial biotinidase deficiency. These mutations reduce biotinidase activity to between 10 percent and 30 percent of normal. Without enough of this enzyme, biotin cannot be recycled. The resulting shortage of free biotin impairs the activity of biotin-dependent carboxylases, leading to a buildup of potentially toxic compounds in the body. If the condition is not treated promptly, this buildup damages various cells and tissues, causing the signs and symptoms associated with biotinidase deficiency. "
181,BTK ,Bruton tyrosine kinase,"The BTK gene provides instructions for making a protein called Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), which is essential for the development and maturation of B cells. B cells are specialized white blood cells that help protect the body against infection. These cells can mature into cells that produce special proteins called antibodies or immunoglobulins. Antibodies attach to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction. The BTK protein transmits important chemical signals that instruct B cells to mature and produce antibodies.","Isolated growth hormone deficiency A few mutations in the BTK gene have been found to cause isolated growth hormone deficiency type III, a condition characterized by slow growth, short stature, and a weakened immune system. Mutations that cause this condition lead to production of a nonfunctional version of the BTK protein. People with isolated growth hormone deficiency are prone to infections because they produce very few B cells and have a shortage of antibodies (agammaglobulinemia). A lack of the BTK protein is likely responsible for the immune system symptoms, but how a shortage of BTK protein causes short stature in affected individuals is unclear. "
182,BUB1B ,BUB1 mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase B,"The BUB1B gene provides instructions for making a protein called BUBR1, which is important for proper chromosome separation during cell division. Before cells divide, they must copy all of their chromosomes. The copied DNA from each chromosome is arranged into two identical structures, called sister chromatids, which are attached to one another during the early stages of cell division. The sets of chromosomes align within the cell, with each chromatid attached to a structure called a spindle microtubule; when all chromatids are correctly attached, the spindle microtubule pulls the two halves of the chromatid pair to opposite sides of the cell. The cell then divides in two such that each new cell contains one complete set of chromosomes.The BUBR1 protein helps ensure that each sister chromatid is attached to a spindle microtubule. If any chromatids remain unattached, the protein prevents cell division.","Mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome More than a dozen mutations in the BUB1B gene have been found to cause mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA) syndrome type 1. This condition is characterized by cells with abnormal numbers of chromosomes, a situation known as aneuploidy. Affected individuals grow slowly and have an unusually small head size (microcephaly) and an increased risk of developing cancer in childhood.MVA syndrome type 1 occurs when both copies of the BUB1B gene have mutations. These mutations reduce the amount of BUBR1 protein in cells or impair the protein's ability to function. A shortage of functioning BUBR1 protein leads to errors in the distribution of chromatids during cell division. Without BUBR1 protein, cell division can proceed, even if all the chromatids are not attached to spindle microtubules. Unattached chromatids are not positioned correctly for separation, and the resulting cells have abnormal numbers of chromosomes.Research suggests that impairment of the process that delays cell division until the correct time underlies the increased risk of cancer in MVA syndrome, although the mechanism is not completely understood. It is also unclear how BUB1B gene mutations or aneuploidy leads to the other features of MVA syndrome. Researchers speculate that the abnormal cells undergo self-destruction (apoptosis). The signs and symptoms of MVA syndrome may be due to the loss of cells from various tissues during early development. "
183,C2 ,complement C2,"The C2 gene provides instructions for making the complement component 2 protein. This protein helps regulate a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (such as bacteria and viruses), trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. When a foreign invader is detected, the complement pathway is turned on (activated) and the complement component 2 protein attaches (binds) to a similar protein called complement component 4. Together, these proteins form a complex called C3 convertase, which triggers further activation of the pathway, allowing the proteins of the complement system to participate in an immune response.","Complement component 2 deficiency At least five mutations in the C2 gene have been found to cause complement component 2 deficiency. This disorder reduces the normal function of the immune system, resulting in an increased risk for infections and autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's tissues and organs.More than 90 percent of people with complement component 2 deficiency have a mutation that deletes 28 DNA building blocks (nucleotides) from the C2 gene. This mutation prevents the production of any complement component 2 protein. Without this protein to form C3 convertase, activation of the complement system is stalled. As a result, the complement system's ability to fight infections is diminished. It is unclear how complement component 2 deficiency leads to increased susceptibility to autoimmune disorders. Researchers speculate that the dysfunctional complement system is unable to distinguish what it should attack, and it sometimes attacks normal tissues, leading to autoimmunity. Alternatively, the dysfunctional complement system may perform partial attacks on invading molecules, which leaves behind foreign fragments that are difficult to distinguish from the body's tissues, so the complement system sometimes attacks the body's own cells. It is likely that other factors, both genetic and environmental, play a role in the variability of the signs and symptoms of complement component 2 deficiency. "
184,C3 ,complement C3,"The C3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called complement component 3 (or C3). This protein plays a key role in a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (such as bacteria and viruses), trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues.The C3 protein is essential for turning on (activating) the complement system. The presence of foreign invaders triggers the C3 protein to be cut (cleaved) into two smaller pieces. One of these pieces, called C3b, interacts with several other proteins on the surface of cells to trigger the complement system's response. This process must be carefully regulated so the complement system targets only unwanted materials and does not damage the body's healthy cells.Researchers have identified two major forms (allotypes) of the C3 protein, which are known as C3S and C3F. In the general population, C3S is more common than C3F. The two allotypes differ by a single protein building block (amino acid), although it is unclear whether they function differently.","C3 glomerulopathy At least one mutation in the C3 gene has been found to cause a rare form of kidney disease called C3 glomerulopathy. This disorder damages the kidneys and can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a life-threatening condition that prevents the kidneys from filtering fluids and waste products from the body effectively.The identified C3 gene mutation deletes two amino acids from the C3 protein. This genetic change is described as a ""gain-of-function"" mutation because it leads to an altered version of the protein that overactivates the complement system. The overactive system damages structures in the kidneys called glomeruli, which are clusters of tiny blood vessels that help filter waste products from the blood. Damage to glomeruli prevents the kidneys from filtering waste products normally and can lead to ESRD.Several other changes in the C3 gene do not cause C3 glomerulopathy directly but appear to increase the likelihood of developing the disorder. In particular, the C3F allotype is seen more frequently in people with this condition than in the general population. Researchers are working to determine how the C3F allotype may influence disease risk. "
185,C8A ,complement C8 alpha chain,"The C8A gene provides instructions for making one piece, the alpha subunit, of a protein complex called complement component 8. The alpha subunit is linked to another piece of the complex called the gamma subunit (produced from the C8G gene). These two proteins interact with the beta subunit (produced from the C8B gene) to form complement component 8.Complement component 8 aids in a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders, trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. Complement component 8 combines with several other complement proteins to form the membrane attack complex (MAC), which inserts itself in the outer membrane of bacterial cells. This complex creates a hole (pore) in the membrane, which kills the bacterium. This part of the immune response appears to be especially important for fighting infection by bacteria in the Neisseria genus.","Complement component 8 deficiency At least two mutations in the C8A gene have been found to cause complement component 8 deficiency type I. This condition is an immune system disorder, known as an immunodeficiency, in which the immune system is not able to protect the body effectively from foreign invaders such as bacteria. People with complement component 8 deficiency have a significantly increased risk of developing recurrent infections, particularly by Neisseria meningitidis, which causes meningitis, a serious condition that involves inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.Mutations in the C8A gene alter the blueprint for protein production; if produced, the abnormally short alpha subunit is likely broken down quickly. The resulting shortage of this protein impairs formation of complement component 8. Deficiency of this component prevents formation of membrane attack complexes. Without this part of the immune response, affected individuals are prone to infection, particularly by Neisseria bacteria. "
186,C8B ,complement C8 beta chain,"The C8B gene provides instructions for making one piece, the beta subunit, of a protein complex called complement component 8. To form this complex, the beta subunit interacts with another piece made up of the alpha subunit (produced from the C8A gene) and the gamma subunit (produced from the C8G gene), which are linked.Complement component 8 aids in a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders, trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues.

This condition is an immune system disorder, known as an immunodeficiency, in which the immune system is not able to protect the body effectively from foreign invaders such as bacteria. People with complement component 8 deficiency have a significantly increased risk of developing recurrent infections, particularly by Neisseria meningitidis, which causes meningitis, a serious condition that involves inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.C8B gene mutations involved in complement component 8 deficiency are most often of a type called a C to T transition, in which a DNA building block (nucleotide) called cytosine (C) is changed to the nucleotide thymine (T). Most commonly, this change occurs in a region of the gene called exon 9, but it can occur in other regions. These mutations alter the sequence of protein building blocks, resulting in an abnormally short protein that, if produced, is likely broken down quickly. Other types of mutations can occur in the C8B gene; they also lead to an abnormally short protein that is quickly broken down. The resulting shortage of this protein impairs formation of complement component 8. Deficiency of this component prevents formation of membrane attack complexes. Without this part of the immune response, affected individuals are prone to infection, particularly by Neisseria bacteria. "
187,C9orf72 ,chromosome 9 open reading frame 72,"The C9orf72 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in various tissues. The protein is abundant in nerve cells (neurons) in the outer layers of the brain (cerebral cortex) and in specialized neurons in the brain and spinal cord that control movement (motor neurons). The C9orf72 protein is thought to be located at the tip of the neuron in a region called the presynaptic terminal. This area is important for sending and receiving signals between neurons.The C9orf72 protein likely plays a role in many processes involving the chemical cousin of DNA, known as RNA. This protein is thought to influence the production of RNA from genes, the production of proteins from RNA, and the transport of RNA within the cell.The C9orf72 gene contains a segment of DNA made up of a series of six DNA building blocks (nucleotides), four guanines followed by two cytosines (written as GGGGCC). This segment (known as a hexanucleotide repeat) can occur once or be repeated multiple times in a row; estimates suggest repeats of up to 30 times have no negative effect on gene function.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Mutations in the C9orf72 gene have been found to cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a condition characterized by progressive muscle weakness, a loss of muscle mass, and an inability to control movement. These mutations affect the GGGGCC segment of the gene. When this series of nucleotides is repeated too many times, it can cause ALS. This type of mutation is called a hexanucleotide repeat expansion. Although it is not clear exactly how many hexanucleotide repeats are needed to cause disease, researchers believe that having more than about 30 repeats can lead to ALS.It is unclear whether the hexanucleotide repeat expansion reduces C9orf72 protein function or leads to the production of a protein with abnormal function that disrupts RNA and protein production in the cell, resulting in the formation of protein clumps (aggregates). In ALS, the large size of motor neurons is thought to make these cells vulnerable to impairments in normal cell function. Disruptions in C9orf72 protein function may lead to premature motor neuron cell death, resulting in the signs and symptoms of ALS.Some people with ALS caused by C9orf72 gene mutations also develop a condition called frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which is a progressive brain disorder that affects personality, behavior, and language. It is unclear why some people with C9orf72 gene mutations develop FTD and others do not. Individuals who develop both conditions are diagnosed as having ALS-FTD. "
188,C19orf12 ,chromosome 19 open reading frame 12,"The C19orf12 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. The protein is found in the membrane of cellular structures called mitochondria, which are the cell's energy-producing centers. Researchers suggest that the C19orf12 protein plays a role in the maintenance of fat (lipid) molecules, a process known as lipid homeostasis.","Mitochondrial membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration At least 28 mutations in the C19orf12 gene have been found to cause a condition known as mitochondrial membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration (MPAN), which is characterized by movement and neurological problems that gradually worsen. Affected individuals also have an abnormal accumulation of iron in certain regions of the brain. The gene mutations that cause this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the C19orf12 protein or lead to an abnormally short protein. These changes likely reduce or eliminate the function of the protein. One C19orf12 gene mutation, which deletes 11 DNA building blocks (nucleotides) from the gene, is found in people of Polish descent who have the condition. This genetic change leads to production of an abnormally short protein, which is quickly broken down. It is unclear how loss of C19orf12 protein function leads to the signs and symptoms of MPAN. Researchers are working to determine whether there is a link between problems with lipid homeostasis and brain iron accumulation or how these abnormalities might contribute to the features of this disorder.C19orf12 gene mutations can cause a spectrum of related conditions with some but not all of the characteristic features of MPAN. For example, some affected individuals have movement problems such as muscle stiffness (spasticity) but not iron accumulation in the brain; these individuals are considered to have a condition called hereditary spastic paraplegia type 43. "
189,CA5A ,carbonic anhydrase 5A,"The CA5A gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase VA. This enzyme helps convert carbon dioxide to a substance called bicarbonate. Bicarbonate is necessary to maintain the proper acid-base balance in the body, which is necessary for most biological reactions to proceed properly.The carbonic anhydrase VA enzyme is particularly important in the liver, where it provides bicarbonate needed by four enzymes in the energy-producing centers of cells (mitochondria): carbomoyl phosphate synthetase-1, pyruvate carboxylase, propionyl-CoA carboxylase, and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase. These enzymes help control the amount of certain other substances in the body. Carbomoyl phosphate synthetase-1 is involved in the urea cycle, which processes excess nitrogen and prevents it from accumulating as ammonia, a substance that is toxic to the brain. Pyruvate carboxylase is involved in the production of the simple sugar glucose (gluconeogenesis) in the liver. Propionyl-CoA carboxylase and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase help break down certain protein building blocks (amino acids).","Carbonic anhydrase VA deficiency At least three CA5A gene mutations have been identified in people with carbonic anhydrase VA deficiency. This inherited disorder is characterized by potentially life-threatening episodes of poor feeding, vomiting, weight loss, tiredness (lethargy), rapid breathing (tachypnea), seizures, or coma. The risk of these episodes is thought to decline after childhood.Mutations in the CA5A gene result in absent or impaired carbonic anhydrase VA enzyme function, leading to reduced bicarbonate production. Insufficient bicarbonate results in impaired control of acid-base balance and reduces the activity of the four affected mitochondrial enzymes, leading to various biochemical abnormalities that are associated with carbonic anhydrase VA deficiency and that cause the episodes that occur in this disorder. Studies suggest that a related enzyme produced from the CA5B gene may increasingly compensate for the lack of carbonic anhydrase VA as affected individuals mature, which may result in a reduced risk of disease episodes after childhood. "
190,CA12 ,carbonic anhydrase 12,"The CA12 gene provides instructions for making a protein called carbonic anhydrase 12 (CA 12), which belongs to a family of proteins known as carbonic anhydrases. These proteins carry out a chemical reaction that involves the molecules carbon dioxide and water and produces a negatively charged bicarbonate molecule (bicarbonate ion) and a positively charged hydrogen atom (known as a proton). Carbonic anhydrases can also carry out the reverse reaction, forming carbon dioxide and water from bicarbonate. Carbon dioxide, bicarbonate, and protons are involved in many functions in the body; by regulating the levels of these substances, carbonic anhydrases play roles in several important processes. The presence of protons and bicarbonate affect the relative acidity (pH) of cells; one function of some carbonic anhydrases is to help maintain the correct cellular pH.CA 12 is found in several tissues, including the sweat glands, kidneys, and large intestine. The protein likely helps regulate the transport of salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) in these tissues. Researchers suggest that channels that move salt in and out of cells are controlled in part by the pH of the cells. By regulating cellular pH, CA 12 may be able to control salt transport. In sweat glands, CA 12 is thought to play a role in determining how much salt is released from the body in sweat.","Isolated hyperchlorhidrosis At least one mutation in the CA12 gene causes isolated hyperchlorhidrosis, a condition characterized by abnormally high levels of salt in sweat that can lead to dehydration associated with low levels of sodium in the blood (hyponatremic dehydration). The gene mutation that causes this condition changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the CA 12 protein, replacing the amino acid glutamate at position 143 with the amino acid lysine (written as Glu143Lys or E143K). The function of the altered protein is reduced to about 70 percent of normal. In addition, the altered protein is more easily turned off (inhibited) than normal, which further reduces protein function. It is thought that the altered CA 12 is less able to regulate pH, and it loses its ability to control how much salt is released in sweat, leading to hyperchlorhidrosis.Researchers suggest that other tissues are seemingly unaffected by CA12 gene mutations because these tissues contain other carbonic anhydrases that compensate for the loss of CA 12 function. "
191,CACNA1A ,calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 A,"The CACNA1A gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making calcium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) across cell membranes, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. Calcium ions are involved in many different cellular functions, including cell-to-cell communication, the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction), and the regulation of certain genes.The CACNA1A gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha-1 subunit) of a calcium channel called CaV2.1. This subunit forms the hole (pore) through which calcium ions can flow. CaV2.1 channels play an essential role in communication between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. These channels help control the release of neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that relay signals from one neuron to another. Researchers believe that CaV2.1 channels are also involved in the survival of neurons and the ability of these cells to change and adapt over time (plasticity).Near one end of the CACNA1A gene, a segment of three DNA building blocks (nucleotides) is repeated multiple times. This sequence, which is written as CAG, is called a triplet or trinucleotide repeat. In most people, the number of CAG repeats in this gene ranges from 4 to 18.","Episodic ataxia More than 80 mutations in the CACNA1A gene have been found to cause episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), the most common form of episodic ataxia. In addition to problems with coordination and balance (ataxia), EA2 is associated with involuntary eye movements called nystagmus. The CACNA1A mutations responsible for EA2 reduce the production of functional CaV2.1 channels or prevent these channels from reaching the cell membrane, where they are needed to transport calcium ions. A decrease in the number of these channels reduces the total flow of calcium ions into neurons, which disrupts the release of neurotransmitters in the brain. Although changes in signaling between neurons underlie the episodes of uncoordinated movement seen in people with episodic ataxia, it is unclear how altered calcium ion transport causes the specific features of the condition. "
192,CACNA1C ,calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 C,"The CACNA1C gene provides instructions for making one of several calcium channels. Calcium channels, which transport positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) into cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate electrical signals. Calcium ions are important for many cellular functions, including regulating the electrical activity of cells, cell-to-cell communication, the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction), and the regulation of certain genes, particularly those involved in the development of the brain and bones before birth.The calcium channel produced from the CACNA1C gene is known as CaV1.2. These channels are found in many types of cells, although they appear to be particularly important for the function of heart cells (cardiomyocytes) and nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. In the heart, CaV1.2 channels open and close at specific times to control the flow of calcium ions into cardiomyocytes at each heartbeat. How long the channels are open and closed is regulated to maintain normal heart function. In the brain, CaV1.2 channels are thought to be involved in memory, the fear response, and the rapid transmission of nerve signals; however, the role of these channels in the brain and other tissues is not completely understood.Researchers have discovered that many different versions (isoforms) of the CaV1.2 channel can be produced from the CACNA1C gene by a mechanism called alternative splicing. This mechanism produces different versions of the channel by cutting and rearranging the genetic instructions in different ways. Some versions of the CaV1.2 channel are more common than others in certain parts of the body. For example, in the heart and brain, about 80 percent of CaV1.2 channels are made with a particular segment known as exon 8. The other 20 percent of CaV1.2 channels contain a slightly different version of this segment, known as exon 8A. This difference becomes important when researchers are studying the effects of CACNA1C mutations in various tissues.",Short QT syndrome Genetics Home Reference provides information about short QT syndrome. 
193,CACNA1D ,calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 D,"The CACNA1D gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making calcium channels. These channels transport positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) across cell membranes. The CACNA1D gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha-1 subunit) of a calcium channel called CaV1.3. This subunit forms the hole (pore) through which calcium ions can flow. CaV1.3 channels are found in many types of cells, although they play a particularly important role in the adrenal glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. In the adrenal glands, the flow of calcium through CaV1.3 channels appears to help regulate the production of the hormone aldosterone, which helps control blood pressure by maintaining proper salt and fluid levels in the body. CaV1.3 channels are also found in the brain, heart, and inner ear, although their roles in these tissues are not well understood.","Aldosterone-producing adenoma Mutations in the CACNA1D gene have been found to cause aldosterone-producing adenomas, which are noncancerous (benign) tumors that form in the adrenal glands. The genetic changes involved in these tumors, called somatic mutations, are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in adrenal gland cells that give rise to the tumors. Such mutations in the CACNA1D gene account for approximately nine percent of cases of aldosterone-producing adenoma.CACNA1D gene mutations associated with this condition lead to production of CaV1.3 channels that transport calcium ions more readily than normal or do not stop when they should. It is thought that the abnormal influx of calcium ions in adrenal gland cells overactivates a process called the calcium/calmodulin pathway that increases production of a hormone called aldosterone. Aldosterone helps control blood pressure by maintaining proper salt and fluid levels in the body, and abnormally high amounts of this hormone lead to high blood pressure (hypertension) and an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Overactivation of the calcium/calmodulin pathway in the adrenal glands also increases cell growth and division (proliferation), which promotes adenoma formation. "
194,CACNA1F ,calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 F,"The CACNA1F gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making calcium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) across cell membranes, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.The CACNA1F gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha-1 subunit) of a calcium channel called CaV1.4. This subunit forms the hole (pore) in the cell membrane through which calcium ions can flow. CaV1.4 channels are found in many types of cells, although they play a particularly important role in a specialized tissue at the back of the eye called the retina. Within the retina, the channels are located in light-detecting cells called photoreceptors. The retina contains two types of photoreceptors: rods and cones. Rods are responsible for vision in low light. Cones provide vision in bright light, including color vision.CaV1.4 channels appear to play a critical role in normal vision. Studies suggest they help relay visual signals from rods and cones to other retinal cells called bipolar cells. This signaling is an essential step in the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain.","X-linked congenital stationary night blindness More than 70 mutations in the CACNA1F gene have been identified in people with X-linked congenital stationary night blindness. Mutations in this gene are responsible for the incomplete form of the disorder, which is characterized by vision problems including a loss of sharpness (reduced acuity), nearsightedness (myopia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). Many affected individuals also have difficulty seeing in low light (night blindness).CACNA1F mutations change the structure of the alpha-1 subunit, which alters or eliminates the function of CaV1.4 channels. These changes prevent the normal transport of calcium ions across the cell membrane of photoreceptor cells. A loss of calcium ion transport disrupts the ability of both rods and cones to transmit visual signals, which impairs vision. "
195,CACNA1S ,calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 S,"The CACNA1S gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making calcium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged calcium atoms (ions) into cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.The CACNA1S gene provides instructions for making calcium channels that are abundant in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For the body to move normally, these muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. Muscle contractions are triggered by the flow of certain ions into muscle cells. Channels made with the CACNA1S protein control the transport of calcium ions into muscle cells and are part of the cellular machinery that initiates muscle contractions.Channels made with the CACNA1S protein also activate a protein called ryanodine receptor 1 (produced by the RYR1 gene). Ryanodine receptor 1 forms a channel that releases stored calcium ions within muscle cells in response to certain signals. The resulting increase in calcium ion concentration stimulates muscle fibers to contract, allowing the body to move.","Hypokalemic periodic paralysis At least four mutations in the CACNA1S gene have been identified in people with hypokalemic periodic paralysis. These mutations cause up to 70 percent of all cases of this disorder.Mutations in the CACNA1S gene change single protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make the CACNA1S protein, which alters the structure and function of calcium channels in skeletal muscle cells. The altered channels open more slowly than usual, reducing the flow of calcium ions into these cells. This disruption in calcium ion transport prevents muscles from contracting normally. It is unclear precisely how these changes lead to episodes of muscle weakness in people with hypokalemic periodic paralysis. "
196,CACNB4 ,calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit beta 4,"The CACNB4 gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making calcium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) into cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. Calcium ions are involved in many different cellular functions, including cell-to-cell communication, the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction), and the regulation of certain genes.Calcium channels are each made up of a large alpha-1 (α1) subunit, which forms the hole (pore) through which calcium ions can flow. Each channel also includes several smaller subunits, which regulate the channel's activity and interact with various proteins inside and outside the cell. The CACNB4 gene provides instructions for making a regulatory subunit called beta-4 (β4). This subunit is most often associated with calcium channels in the brain, particularly the part of the brain that is involved in coordinating movements (the cerebellum).In the brain, calcium channels play an essential role in communication between nerve cells (neurons). These channels help control the release of neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that relay signals from one neuron to another. Researchers believe that calcium channels are also involved in the survival of neurons and the ability of these cells to change and adapt over time (plasticity).","Episodic ataxia Researchers have identified at least one mutation in the CACNB4 gene that is likely to cause episodic ataxia. This mutation, which was found in a French-Canadian family with episodic ataxia type 5 (EA5), changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the calcium channel β4 subunit. Specifically, it replaces the amino acid cysteine with the amino acid phenylalanine at position 104 (written as Cys104Phe or C104F). Scientists speculate that this genetic change may alter the ability of the β4 subunit to interact with other proteins and in some way disrupt the normal function of calcium channels in the brain. It is unclear how these effects may lead to episodes of uncoordinated movement and the other signs and symptoms of episodic ataxia. "
197,CALR ,calreticulin,"The CALR gene provides instructions for making a multi-functional protein called calreticulin. This protein is found in several parts of the cell, including inside a structure called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in the fluid-filled space inside the cell (the cytoplasm), and at the outer surface of the cell. The ER is involved in protein processing and transport, and within this structure, calreticulin plays a role in ensuring the proper folding of newly formed proteins. The ER is also a storage location for charged calcium atoms (calcium ions), and calreticulin is involved in maintaining the correct levels of calcium ions in this structure. Through calcium regulation and other mechanisms, calreticulin is thought to play a role in the control of gene activity, cell growth and division (proliferation) and movement (migration), the attachment of cells to one another (adhesion), and regulation of programmed cell death (apoptosis). The function of this protein is important for immune system function and wound healing.",19p13.13 deletion syndrome Genetics Home Reference provides information about 19p13.13 deletion syndrome. 
198,CAPN3 ,calpain 3,"The CAPN3 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called calpain-3, which is found within muscle cells in structures called sarcomeres. Sarcomeres are the basic unit of muscle contraction. They are made of proteins that generate the mechanical force needed for muscles to contract.The function of the calpain-3 enzyme is not well understood. Researchers suggest it may help cut (cleave) damaged proteins into shorter segments to facilitate their removal from the sarcomere. Studies have also shown that calpain-3 attaches (binds) to proteins involved in controlling the ability of muscle fibers to stretch (elasticity) and in cell signaling. However, its specific roles in these processes are unknown.","Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy More than 300 mutations in the CAPN3 gene have been identified in people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A. This form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is also called calpainopathy.Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is a group of related disorders characterized by muscle weakness and wasting, particularly in the shoulders, hips, and limbs. CAPN3 gene mutations are the most common cause of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. These mutations account for approximately 30 percent of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy cases overall, although the percentage varies by specific population.Most CAPN3 gene mutations change one protein building block (amino acid) in the calpain-3 enzyme. These mutations result in a calpain-3 enzyme that is abnormally short or unstable. Disruption of the enzyme's ability to properly cleave proteins for removal from the sarcomere may allow these waste proteins to accumulate in muscle tissue and become toxic. Other mechanisms have also been suggested to account for the muscle damage that underlies limb-girdle muscular dystrophy in people with CAPN3 gene mutations. "
199,CARD9 ,caspase recruitment domain family member 9,"The CARD9 gene provides instructions for making an immune system protein that is involved in the body's defense against fungal infections and is particularly important for fighting infection by a fungus called Candida. When the immune system recognizes Candida, it generates cells called Th17 cells. These cells produce signaling molecules (cytokines) called the interleukin-17 (IL-17) family as part of an immune process called the IL-17 pathway. The IL-17 pathway creates inflammation, sending other cytokines and white blood cells that fight foreign invaders and promote tissue repair. In addition, the IL-17 pathway promotes the production of certain antimicrobial protein segments (peptides) that control growth of Candida on the surface of mucous membranes.In its role in defending against Candida on the mucous membranes and skin, the CARD9 protein passes along signals from other types of immune system proteins. Each of these proteins recognizes a different component of the Candida cell wall to trigger the production of Th17 cells and launch the immune response.In addition to its role in protecting mucous membranes from fungal infection, the CARD9 protein is also important in recruiting neutrophils (immune cells that have strong anti-fungal activity) from the blood to protect the brain and other organs from fungal infection.","Familial candidiasis At least 15 CARD9 gene mutations have been identified in people with familial candidiasis, an inherited tendency to develop infections caused by the Candida fungus (commonly called yeast infections). Most people with familial candidiasis have chronic yeast infections of the skin, nails, and mucous membranes. This pattern of signs and symptoms, which is called chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, typically begins in early childhood. People with familial candidiasis caused by CARD9 gene mutations can also develop systemic candidiasis, a potentially life-threatening condition in which Candida invades the blood and vital organs, especially the brain. Infections caused by additional types of fungi have also been identified in some people with this form of the disorder, which is sometimes called CARD9 deficiency.Mutations in the CARD9 gene impair multiple signaling pathways that normally help recognize Candida and are thought to block (inhibit) the activity of the IL-17 pathway. Impairment of this pathway diminishes the body's immune response to Candida, leading to the chronic or recurrent yeast infections that occur in people with familial candidiasis. The mutations are also thought to impair the recruitment of neutrophils to fight Candida infection in the brain and other organs, which can lead to systemic candidiasis. "
200,CARD11 ,caspase recruitment domain family member 11,"The CARD11 gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in the function of immune system cells called lymphocytes, particularly certain types called T cells and B cells. These cells identify foreign substances such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi and defend the body against infection. When T or B cells recognize a foreign substance, the CARD11 protein is turned on (activated) and attaches (binds) to two other proteins, BCL10 and MALT1, to form the CBM signalosome complex. This complex in turn activates other protein complexes called nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB) and mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), which are important for cellular signaling. NF-κB and mTORC1 signaling direct the development and function of T and B cells so they can support an immune response against foreign invaders.","Atopic dermatitis At least five CARD11 gene mutations have been identified in people with a skin disorder called atopic dermatitis (also known as atopic eczema). This condition is characterized by dry, itchy skin and red rashes. The word ""atopic"" indicates an association with allergies. While atopic dermatitis is not always due to an allergic reaction, it is commonly associated with other allergic disorders. People with atopic dermatitis caused by CARD11 gene mutations often have additional allergic disorders, such as asthma and environmental (such as pollen) or food allergies. Many of these individuals also have recurrent infections due to problems with the immune system (immunodeficiency).Atopic dermatitis is generally thought of as a complex condition that is influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors, which each contribute only a small amount to the overall risk of developing the condition. However, CARD11 gene mutations appear to cause atopic dermatitis without other factors. These mutations likely account for only a small percentage of cases of the condition.A mutation in one of the two copies of the CARD11 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause atopic dermatitis. These mutations result in the production of an altered protein that does not function normally. The altered protein produced from the mutated copy of the gene interferes with the normal protein produced from the non-mutated copy of the gene (such mutations are described as ""dominant-negative""), so the amount of functioning CARD11 protein in cells is reduced. These genetic changes are thought to prevent formation of the CBM signalosome complex, impairing signaling by NF-κB and mTORC1. Without these signals, T cells do not develop or function properly. The number of these cells is normal, but their response to foreign invaders is diminished, leading to recurrent infections.It is not clear how the immune dysfunction caused by CARD11 gene mutations leads to atopic dermatitis and allergic disorders. Atopic dermatitis is not initially caused by an allergic reaction, although sometimes substances that can cause allergic reactions (allergens) are thought to contribute to flare-ups of the rashes. "
201,CARD14 ,caspase recruitment domain family member 14,"The CARD14 gene provides instructions for making a protein that turns on (activates) a group of interacting proteins known as nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB). The NF-κB protein complex regulates the activity of multiple genes, including genes that control the body's immune responses and inflammatory reactions. Inflammation is a normal immune system response to injury and foreign invaders (such as bacteria). The NF-κB protein complex also protects cells from certain signals that would otherwise cause them to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis).The CARD14 protein is found in many of the body's tissues, but it is particularly abundant in the skin. NF-κB signaling appears to play important roles in regulating inflammatory reactions in the skin and in promoting the survival of skin cells.","Familial pityriasis rubra pilaris At least three mutations in the CARD14 gene have been identified in people with familial pityriasis rubra pilaris, a rare hereditary skin condition characterized by a patchy, salmon-colored skin rash covered in fine scales. These mutations lead to overactivation of NF-κB signaling, which triggers an abnormal inflammatory response in the skin. Researchers are working to determine how these changes lead to the specific features of familial pityriasis rubra pilaris. "
202,CASK ,calcium/calmodulin dependent serine protein kinase,"The CASK gene provides instructions for making a protein called calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK). The CASK protein is primarily found in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain, where it helps control the activity (expression) of other genes that are involved in brain development. It also helps regulate the movement of chemicals called neurotransmitters and of charged atoms (ions), which are necessary for signaling between neurons. Research suggests that the CASK protein may also interact with the protein produced from another gene, FRMD7, to promote development of the nerves that control eye movement (the oculomotor neural network).","CASK-related intellectual disability More than 35 CASK gene mutations have been identified in people with CASK-related intellectual disability. This disorder affects brain development and has two main forms: a severe form called microcephaly with pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia (MICPCH), and a milder form called X-linked intellectual disability (XL-ID) with or without nystagmus.The mutations that cause CASK-related intellectual disability affect the role of the CASK protein in brain development and function. MICPCH is caused by mutations that eliminate CASK function, while mutations that impair the function of this protein cause XL-ID with or without nystagmus. Nystagmus refers to rapid, involuntary back-and-forth eye movements. Affected individuals with nystagmus may have CASK gene mutations that disrupt the interaction between the CASK protein and the protein produced from the FRMD7 gene, leading to problems with the development of the oculomotor neural network and resulting in abnormal eye movements. "
203,CASQ2 ,calsequestrin 2,"The CASQ2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called calsequestrin 2. This protein is found in heart (cardiac) muscle cells called myocytes, where it is involved in the storage and transport of positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions).Within myocytes, calsequestrin 2 is located in a cell structure called the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which acts as a storage center for calcium ions. Most of these ions are stored by attaching (binding) to calsequestrin 2. This protein also helps regulate a protein called the RYR2 channel, which controls the flow of calcium ions out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.For the heart to beat normally, the cardiac muscle must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. This cycle of muscle contraction and relaxation results from the precise control of calcium ions within myocytes. In response to certain signals, calcium ions stored by calsequestrin 2 in the sarcoplasmic reticulum are released into the surrounding cell fluid (the cytoplasm). The resulting increase in calcium ion concentration triggers the cardiac muscle to contract, which pumps blood out of the heart. Calcium ions are then transported back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and the cardiac muscle relaxes. In this way, the release and reuptake of calcium ions in myocytes produces a regular heart rhythm.","Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia At least seven mutations in the CASQ2 gene have been identified in people with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). Some of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the calsequestrin 2 protein, while other mutations prevent the cell from producing any functional calsequestrin 2. Studies suggest that the altered or missing protein is unable to perform its usual roles in calcium binding within myocytes. A lack of properly functioning calsequestrin 2 may also affect regulation of the RYR2 channel, allowing calcium ions to ""leak"" out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. These changes disrupt the careful control of calcium ion flow within myocytes, which can trigger an abnormal heart rhythm in people with CPVT. "
204,CASR ,calcium sensing receptor,"The CASR gene provides instructions for making a protein called the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). Calcium molecules attach (bind) to CaSR, which allows this protein to monitor and regulate the amount of calcium in the blood. The receptor is turned on (activated) when a certain concentration of calcium is reached, and the activated receptor sends signals to block processes that increase the amount of calcium in the blood.The CaSR protein is found in abundance in cells of the parathyroid glands. The parathyroid glands produce and release a hormone called parathyroid hormone that works to increase the levels of calcium in the blood. When large amounts of calcium bind to CaSR in the parathyroid glands, the production of parathyroid hormone is blocked, which prevents the release of more calcium into the blood. CaSR signaling also blocks the growth and division (proliferation) of cells that make up the parathyroid glands.The CaSR protein is also found in kidney cells. Kidneys filter fluid and waste products in the body and can reabsorb needed nutrients and release them back into the blood. Increased calcium binding to CaSR in kidney cells blocks the reabsorption of calcium from the filtered fluids.","Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia Mutations in the CASR gene can cause a condition called autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1, which is characterized by low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia). Some affected individuals also have a shortage of parathyroid hormone (hypoparathyroidism).Most CASR gene mutations involved in this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the CaSR protein. The changes (called activating mutations) lead to an overactive CaSR that is more sensitive to calcium, meaning even low levels of calcium can trigger signaling. The overactive CaSR blocks the release of parathyroid hormone, which prevents the release of calcium into the blood. In addition, the overactive CaSR prevents reabsorption of calcium from the fluids filtered through the kidneys. Hypocalcemia can cause muscle cramping and seizures, although about half of people with this condition have no associated health problems. "
205,CAT ,catalase,"The CAT gene provides instructions for making pieces (subunits) of an enzyme called catalase. Four identical subunits, each attached (bound) to an iron-containing molecule called a heme group, form the functional enzyme.Catalase is active in cells and tissues throughout the body, where it breaks down hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) molecules into oxygen (O2) and water (H2O). Hydrogen peroxide is produced through chemical reactions within cells. At low levels, it is involved in several chemical signaling pathways, but at high levels it is toxic to cells. If hydrogen peroxide is not broken down by catalase, additional reactions convert it into compounds called reactive oxygen species that can damage DNA, proteins, and cell membranes.","Acatalasemia At least 13 mutations in the CAT gene have been found to cause acatalasemia, a condition characterized by very low catalase activity. Many people with acatalasemia never have any related health problems, although the condition has occasionally been associated with open sores (ulcers) inside the mouth leading to the death of soft tissue (gangrene). Acatalasemia also appears to increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (the most common form of diabetes) and is a potential risk factor for other common, complex diseases.The mutations that cause acatalasemia occur in both copies of the CAT gene in each cell, and they reduce the activity of catalase to less than 10 percent of normal. A shortage of this enzyme can allow hydrogen peroxide to build up to toxic levels in certain cells. For example, hydrogen peroxide produced by bacteria in the mouth may accumulate in and damage soft tissues, leading to mouth ulcers and gangrene. A buildup of hydrogen peroxide may also damage beta cells of the pancreas, which release a hormone called insulin that helps control blood sugar. Malfunctioning beta cells are thought to underlie the increased risk of type 2 diabetes in people with acatalasemia. It is unclear why some people have no health problems associated with a shortage of catalase activity.A related condition called hypocatalasemia occurs when only one of the two copies of the CAT gene in each cell has a mutation. This single mutation reduces the activity of catalase by approximately half. Like acatalasemia, hypocatalasemia usually does not cause any health problems. "
206,CATSPER1 ,cation channel sperm associated 1,"The CATSPER1 gene provides instructions for producing a protein that is found in the tail (flagellum) of sperm cells. The CATSPER1 protein plays a role in sperm cell movement (motility) and is required for sperm cells to push through the outside membrane of the egg cell during fertilization. The CATSPER1 protein is embedded in the membrane of sperm cells and is necessary for positively charged calcium atoms (calcium cations) to enter the cell. Calcium cations are required for a type of sperm motility called hyperactivation. Hyperactivation is characterized by vigorous movements of the sperm tail, which are necessary for the sperm to push through the membrane of the egg cell during fertilization.","CATSPER1-related nonsyndromic male infertility At least two mutations in the CATSPER1 gene have been found to cause CATSPER1-related nonsyndromic male infertility. These mutations are thought to lead to the production of a CATSPER1 protein that may be altered, nonfunctional, or quickly broken down (degraded) by the cell. A lack of functional CATSPER1 protein impairs calcium entry into the sperm cell, which decreases motility and prevents hyperactivation. Lack of hyperactivation results in sperm that are unable to push through the membrane of the egg cell and achieve fertilization. These sperm abnormalities are the cause of infertility in affected males. Male infertility is the only symptom of CATSPER1-related nonsyndromic male infertility. "
207,CATSPER2 ,cation channel sperm associated 2,"The CATSPER2 gene provides instructions for producing a protein that is found in the tail (flagellum) of sperm cells. The CATSPER2 protein plays a role in sperm cell movement (motility) and is required for sperm cells to push through the outside membrane of the egg cell during fertilization. The CATSPER2 protein is embedded in the membrane of the sperm tail and is necessary in order for positively charged calcium atoms (calcium cations) to enter the cell. Calcium cations are needed for a type of sperm motility called hyperactivation. Hyperactivation is characterized by vigorous movements of the sperm tail, which are required for the sperm to push through the membrane of the egg cell during fertilization.","Sensorineural deafness and male infertility The symptoms of sensorineural deafness and male infertility are caused by a deletion of genetic material on the long (q) arm of chromosome 15. The chromosomal region that is typically deleted contains multiple genes, including the CATSPER2 gene. People with this condition have the deletion in both copies of chromosome 15 in each cell. As a result of the deletion, affected individuals are missing both copies of the CATSPER2 gene, and no CATSPER2 protein is produced. A lack of CATSPER2 protein impairs calcium entry into the sperm cell, which decreases motility and prevents hyperactivation. Lack of hyperactivation results in sperm that are unable to push through the membrane of the egg cell and achieve fertilization. These sperm abnormalities are the cause of infertility in affected males. "
208,CAV1 ,caveolin 1,"The CAV1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called caveolin-1. This protein appears to have diverse functions in cells and tissues throughout the body.Caveolin-1 is the major component of caveolae, which are small pouches in the membrane that surrounds cells. Caveolae have multiple functions, some of which are not well understood. They are known to be involved in the transport of molecules from the cell membrane to the interior of the cell (endocytosis), processing of molecules on their way into the cell, maintaining the cell structure, and regulating chemical signaling pathways. Studies suggest that caveolae are particularly numerous in adipocytes, which are cells that store fats for energy. Adipocytes make up most of the body's fatty (adipose) tissue. In these cells, caveolae appear to be essential for the normal transport, processing, and storage of fats.Caveolin-1 is also found in many other parts of cells, where it regulates various chemical signaling pathways. Through these pathways, caveolin-1 is involved in regulating cell growth and division (proliferation), the process by which cells mature to perform specific functions (differentiation), cell survival and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis), and cell movement. The functions of caveolin-1 likely differ depending on the type of cell and the part of the cell where the protein is found.","Congenital generalized lipodystrophy At least one mutation in the CAV1 gene has been found to cause congenital generalized lipodystrophy (also called Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy) type 3. This rare condition is characterized by an almost total absence of adipose tissue and a very muscular appearance. A shortage of adipose tissue leads to multiple health problems, including high levels of fats called triglycerides circulating in the bloodstream (hypertriglyceridemia) and diabetes mellitus. Additional features of congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 3 include poor growth and short stature.The identified mutation replaces a single protein building block (amino acid) with a premature stop signal at position 38 of the caveolin-1 protein (written as Glu38Ter or E38X.) This mutation occurs in both copies of the CAV1 gene in each cell, and it prevents cells from producing any functional caveolin-1. It is unclear how a lack of this protein leads to the particular features of congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 3. However, the absence of caveolin-1 likely disrupts the normal development and function of adipocytes, which would prevent fats from being stored normally in adipose tissue. A lack of body fat underlies many of the signs and symptoms of this condition. "
209,CAV3 ,caveolin 3,"The CAV3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called caveolin-3, which is found in the membrane surrounding muscle cells. This protein is the main component of caveolae, which are small pouches in the muscle cell membrane. Within the caveolae, the caveolin-3 protein acts as a scaffold to organize other molecules that are important for cell signaling and maintenance of the cell structure. These molecules include the proteins that make up sodium channels, which transport positively charged sodium atoms (sodium ions) into cells. Sodium channels play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. In cardiac muscle, sodium channels are involved in maintaining the heart's normal rhythm. Caveolin-3 may also help regulate calcium levels in the muscle cell, which control muscle contraction and relaxation.","CAV3-related distal myopathy At least two CAV3 gene mutations have been identified in people with distal myopathy, a disorder characterized by weakness and loss of function mainly affecting the muscles farthest from the center of the body (distal muscles), such as those of the hands and feet. Mutations that cause CAV3-related distal myopathy result in a shortage of caveolin-3 protein in the muscle cell membrane and a reduction in the number of caveolae. Researchers suggest that a shortage of caveolae impairs the structural integrity of muscle cells, interferes with cell signaling, and causes the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). The resulting breakdown of muscle tissue leads to the signs and symptoms of CAV3-related distal myopathy. "
210,CAVIN1 ,caveolae associated protein 1,"The CAVIN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cavin-1. This protein is found in cells and tissues throughout the body. It is most abundant in several types of cells: osteoblasts, which are cells that build bones; muscle cells; and adipocytes, which are cells that store fats for energy. Adipocytes make up most of the body's fatty (adipose) tissue.Studies suggest that cavin-1 plays an essential role in forming and stabilizing caveolae, which are small pouches in the membrane that surrounds cells. Caveolae have multiple functions, some of which are not well understood. They are known to be involved in the transport of molecules from the cell membrane to the interior of the cell (endocytosis), processing of molecules on their way into the cell, maintaining the cell structure, and regulating chemical signaling pathways. Caveolae are particularly numerous in adipocytes, where they appear to be essential for the normal transport, processing, and storage of fats.Within cells, cavin-1 is also found in the nucleus and in the fluid that surrounds the nucleus (the cytoplasm). In addition to its role in caveolae, studies suggest that this protein is involved in repairing damage to the outer cell membrane, cell growth and division (proliferation), cell movement, stopping cell division in older cells (senescence), and regulating various chemical signaling pathways. The functions of cavin-1 likely differ depending on the type of cell and the part of the cell where the protein is found.","Congenital generalized lipodystrophy More than 10 mutations in the CAVIN1 gene have been found to cause congenital generalized lipodystrophy (also called Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy) type 4. This rare condition is characterized by an almost total absence of adipose tissue and a very muscular appearance. A shortage of adipose tissue leads to multiple health problems, including high levels of fats called triglycerides circulating in the bloodstream (hypertriglyceridemia) and diabetes mellitus. Additional features of congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 4 include muscle weakness, delayed development, joint abnormalities, a narrowing of the lower part of the stomach (pyloric stenosis), and severe abnormalities of the heart rhythm (arrhythmias) that can lead to sudden death.All of the identified CAVIN1 gene mutations prevent cells from producing any functional cavin-1. A lack of this protein probably impairs the formation of caveolae. Researchers suspect that a shortage of these important structures on the cell membrane disrupts many cell functions. However, it is unknown specifically how the absence of cavin-1 leads to a loss of body fat and the other health problems associated with congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 4. "
211,CBFB ,core-binding factor subunit beta,"The CBFB gene provides instructions for making a protein called core binding factor beta (CBFβ), which is one piece of a protein complex known as core binding factor (CBF). CBFβ attaches (binds) to one of three related RUNX proteins (RUNX1, RUNX2, or RUNX3) to form different versions of CBF. These protein complexes bind to specific regions of DNA and help turn on (activate) certain genes.The presence of CBFβ helps the complex bind to DNA and protects the RUNX protein from being broken down. The function of CBF depends on which RUNX protein it includes. Once bound to DNA, the RUNX1 protein controls the activity of genes involved in the development of blood cells (hematopoiesis). The RUNX2 protein regulates genes important for bone cell development and formation of the skeleton. The RUNX3 protein primarily affects genes involved in the development of nerve cells.","Core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia Rearrangements of genetic material affecting the CBFB gene are involved in a form of blood cancer known as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Because the genetic changes affect CBF, the condition is classified as core binding factor AML (CBF-AML). The most common of these rearrangements is an inversion of a region of chromosome 16 (written as inv(16)). An inversion involves breakage of the chromosome in two places; the resulting piece of DNA is reversed and reinserted into the chromosome. Less commonly, a rearrangement known as a translocation occurs between the two copies of chromosome 16 (written as t(16;16)). In this translocation, pieces of DNA from each copy of the chromosome break off and are interchanged. Both types of genetic rearrangement lead to the fusion of parts of two genes on chromosome 16, CBFB and MYH11. These rearrangements are associated with 5 to 8 percent of cases of AML in adults.When these rearrangements occur in early blood cells, the function of the RUNX1 protein is particularly affected. The protein produced from the fusion gene, called CBFβ-MYH11, can still bind to RUNX1 to form CBF. However, the function of CBF is impaired. The presence of CBFβ-MYH11 may block binding of CBF to DNA, preventing RUNX1 from controlling gene activity. Alternatively, the MYH11 portion of the fusion protein may interact with other proteins that prevent RUNX1 from controlling gene activity. This change in gene activity blocks the maturation (differentiation) of blood cells and leads to the production of abnormal, immature white blood cells called myeloid blasts. While inv(16) and t(16;16) are important for leukemia development, one or more additional genetic changes are typically needed for the myeloid blasts to develop into cancerous leukemia cells. "
212,CBS ,cystathionine-beta-synthase,"The CBS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called cystathionine beta-synthase. This enzyme acts in a chemical pathway and is responsible for using vitamin B6 to convert building block of proteins (amino acid) called homocysteine and serine to a molecule called cytathionine. Another enzyme then converts cystathionine to the amino acid cysteine, which is used to build proteins or is broken down and excreted in urine. Additionally, other amino acids, including methionine, are produced in this pathway.","Homocystinuria More than 150 mutations that cause homocystinuria have been identified in the CBS gene. Most of these mutations change single amino acids in cystathionine beta-synthase. The most common mutation substitutes the amino acid threonine for the amino acid isoleucine at position 278 in the enzyme (written as Ile278Thr or I278T). Another common mutation, which is the most frequent cause of homocystinuria in the Irish population, replaces the amino acid glycine with the amino acid serine at position 307 (written as Gly307Ser or G307S). These mutations disrupt the normal function of cystathionine beta-synthase. As a result, homocysteine and other potentially toxic compounds build up in the blood, and homocysteine is excreted in urine. Researchers have not determined how excess homocysteine leads to the signs and symptoms of homocystinuria. "
213,CCBE1 ,collagen and calcium binding EGF domains 1,"The CCBE1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell (extracellular matrix). The CCBE1 protein is involved in the formation of the lymphatic system, which consists of a network of vessels that transport lymph fluid and immune cells throughout the body. Specifically, the CCBE1 protein helps guide maturation (differentiation) and movement (migration) of immature cells called lymphangioblasts that will eventually form the lining (epithelium) of lymphatic vessels.","Hennekam syndrome At least 13 mutations in the CCBE1 gene have been found to cause Hennekam syndrome, an inherited disorder resulting from malformation of the lymphatic system. Most CCBE1 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the CCBE1 protein leading to a change in the three-dimensional shape of the protein. The abnormal protein cannot play its role in the formation of the lymphatic vessel epithelium. A poorly formed lymphatic system leads to lymphatic vessels that are abnormally expanded (lymphangiectasia) and are prone to break open (rupture), puffiness or swelling caused by a buildup of fluid (lymphedema), and other features of Hennekam syndrome. CCBE1 gene mutations account for about 25 percent of all cases of Hennekam syndrome. "
214,CCM2 ,CCM2 scaffold protein,"The CCM2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called malcavernin, which strengthens the interactions between cells that form blood vessels and limits leakage from the vessels. Malcavernin interacts with a number of other proteins to form a complex that is found in the junctions that connect neighboring cells. As part of this complex, malcavernin helps turn off (suppress) a signaling molecule known as RhoA-GTPase. This molecule plays a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, which is a network of fibers that makes up the cell's structural framework. When turned on, RhoA-GTPase stimulates the formation of actin fibers, which has been linked to weakened junctions between cells and increased leakage from blood vessels.Malcavernin is also involved in a process called angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels.","Cerebral cavernous malformation Dozens of mutations in the CCM2 gene have been identified in families with cerebral cavernous malformations, which are collections of blood vessels in the brain that are weak and prone to leakage. Most of these mutations result in an abnormally short or malformed malcavernin protein that does not function. A shortage of this protein likely impairs the function of the complex. As a result, RhoA-GTPase signaling is turned on abnormally, weakening cellular junctions and increasing the permeability of blood vessel walls. The increased leakage into the brain can cause health problems such as headaches, seizures, and bleeding in the brain (cerebral hemorrhage) in some people with cerebral cavernous malformations.Mutations in the CCM2 gene are involved in approximately 15 percent of all familial cerebral cavernous malformation cases. "
215,CCN6 ,cellular communication network factor 6,"The CCN6 gene provides instructions for making a protein that appears to be involved in bone growth and the maintenance of cartilage, which covers and protects the ends of bones. The function of the CCN6 protein is not well understood. It is part of a family of proteins that are involved in the growth and maintenance of connective tissues, such as bone, cartilage, and blood vessels. The CCN6 protein is made in cells called chondrocytes, which produce and maintain cartilage, and is associated with the production of certain proteins that make up cartilage, but its role in their production is unclear. CCN6 may also help control signaling pathways involved in the development of cartilage and bone and may help regulate the breakdown of cartilage components.","Progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia Mutations in the CCN6 gene cause progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia (PPRD), which is a condition that causes stiffness and pain in the joints of the hands, hips, knees, and spine. The joint problems worsen over time, and movement in the joints becomes limited. Most of the mutations involved in this condition lead to production of an abnormally short CCN6 protein that is probably nonfunctional. Other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the protein. Loss of CCN6 protein function likely disrupts normal cartilage maintenance and bone growth, leading to the joint problems in PPRD. "
216,CCND2 ,cyclin D2,"The CCND2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cyclin D2. Cyclins are a family of proteins that control how cells proceed through the multi-step cycle of cell division. Cyclin D2 helps to regulate a step in the cycle called the G1-S transition, in which the cell moves from the G1 phase, when cell growth occurs, to the S phase, when the cell's DNA is copied (replicated) in preparation for cell division. Cyclin D2's role in the cell division cycle makes it a key controller of the rate of cell growth and division (proliferation) in the body.The cyclin D2 protein is regulated by a chemical signaling pathway called the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. This signaling influences many critical cell functions, including the creation (synthesis) of new proteins, cell proliferation, and the survival of cells. The PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is essential for the normal development of many parts of the body, including the brain.","Megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome At least seven mutations in the CCND2 gene have been found to cause megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndrome. This rare condition affects the development of the brain, causing an unusually large brain and head size (megalencephaly) and a brain abnormality called bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria (BPP). Some affected individuals also have an extra finger or toe on one or more of their hands or feet (polydactyly).Each of the known mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the cyclin D2 protein. These changes prevent the protein from being broken down (degraded) when it is no longer needed. The resulting buildup of cyclin D2 in cells triggers them to continue dividing when they otherwise would not have, leading to abnormal cell proliferation. In the brain, the increased number of cells leads to rapid and abnormal brain growth starting before birth. It is less clear how a buildup of cyclin D2 contributes to polydactyly, although the extra digits are probably related to abnormal cell proliferation in the developing hands and feet. "
217,CD40LG ,CD40 ligand,"The CD40LG gene provides instructions for making a protein called CD40 ligand, which is found on the surface of immune system cells known as T cells. CD40 ligand attaches like a key in a lock to its receptor protein, CD40, which is located on the surface of immune system cells known as B cells. B cells are involved in the production of proteins called antibodies or immunoglobulins that help protect the body against infection. There are several classes of antibodies, and each one has a different function in the immune system. B cells are able to mature into the cells that produce immunoglobulin M (IgM) without any signals from other cells. In order for B cells to mature into the cells that produce antibodies of a different class, the CD40 receptor must interact with CD40 ligand. When these two proteins are connected, they trigger a series of chemical signals that instruct the B cell to start making immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin E (IgE).CD40 ligand is also necessary for T cells to interact with other cells of the immune system, and it plays a key role in T cell differentiation (the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions).","X-linked hyper IgM syndrome More than 150 mutations in the CD40LG gene have been found to cause X-linked hyper IgM syndrome. These mutations lead to the production of an abnormal CD40 ligand or prevent production of this protein. If CD40 ligand does not attach to its receptor on B cells, these cells cannot produce IgG, IgA, or IgE antibodies. Mutations in the CD40LG gene also impair the T cell's ability to differentiate and interact with immune system cells. People with X-linked hyper IgM syndrome are more susceptible to infections because they do not have a properly functioning immune system. "
218,CDAN1 ,codanin 1,"The CDAN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called codanin-1. Although this protein is active in cells throughout the body, very little is known about its function.A recent study suggests that codanin-1 is associated with a form of DNA called heterochromatin. Heterochromatin is densely packed DNA that contains few functional genes, but it plays an important role in maintaining the structure of the nucleus (where most of the cell's DNA is located).Researchers speculate that codanin-1 may be involved in the formation of red blood cells, a process called erythropoiesis. Specifically, this protein may play a key role in the organization of heterochromatin during the division of these developing cells.","Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia More than 30 mutations in the CDAN1 gene have been identified in people with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) type I. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the codanin-1 protein. The CDAN1 mutations that cause CDA type I likely reduce the function of codanin-1. However, researchers suspect that these mutations do not completely eliminate the function of the protein, which appears to be essential for life.It is unclear how CDAN1 mutations cause the characteristic features of CDA type I. A shortage of functional codanin-1 somehow disrupts the normal development of red blood cells. In people with CDA type I, immature red blood cells called erythroblasts are large, unusually shaped, and have an abnormally formed nucleus. These defective erythroblasts cannot develop into functional mature red blood cells. The resulting shortage of healthy red blood cells leads to the characteristic signs and symptoms of anemia, as well as complications including an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) and an abnormal buildup of iron that can damage the body's organs. "
219,CDC6 ,cell division cycle 6,"The CDC6 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is important in the copying of a cell's DNA before the cell divides (a process known as DNA replication). The protein produced from this gene, called cell division cycle 6 or CDC6, is one of a group of proteins known as the pre-replication complex. In a multi-step process, the components of this complex attach (bind) to certain regions of DNA known as origins of replication (or origins), where the process of DNA copying begins. When the pre-replication complex is attached to the origin, replication is able to begin at that location. This tightly controlled process, called replication licensing, helps ensure that DNA replication occurs only once per cell division and is required for cells to divide.","Meier-Gorlin syndrome At least one mutation in the CDC6 gene causes Meier-Gorlin syndrome, a condition characterized by short stature, underdeveloped kneecaps, and small ears. This mutation, which is a rare cause of the condition, changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the CDC6 protein, replacing the amino acid threonine at position 323 with the amino acid arginine (written as Thr323Arg). As a result, assembly of the pre-replication complex is impaired, which disrupts replication licensing; however, it is not clear how a reduction in replication licensing leads to Meier-Gorlin syndrome. Researchers speculate that such a reduction delays the cell division process, which slows growth of the bones and other tissues during development. It is not known why development of the kneecaps and ears is particularly affected in Meier-Gorlin syndrome. "
220,CDC73 ,cell division cycle 73,"The CDC73 gene (also known as HRPT2) provides instructions for making a protein called parafibromin. This protein is found primarily in the nucleus of cells and is likely involved in regulating gene transcription, which is the first step in protein production. Parafibromin functions as a tumor suppressor, which means it keeps cells from growing and dividing (proliferating) too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. When parafibromin is found outside the nucleus, it appears to be involved in the organization of the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton).","Familial isolated hyperparathyroidism Inherited mutations in the CDC73 gene have been found in some families with familial isolated hyperparathyroidism, a condition characterized by overactivity of the parathyroid glands (primary hyperparathyroidism). These glands release a hormone that helps control the normal balance of calcium in the blood. Primary hyperparathyroidism disrupts this balance, which can lead to high blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia), kidney stones, thinning of the bones (osteoporosis), nausea, vomiting, high blood pressure (hypertension), weakness, and fatigue. Primary hyperparathyroidism is a characteristic feature of hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome (described below); however, familial isolated hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed in people with hyperparathyroidism but not the other features of hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome.CDC73 gene mutations that cause familial isolated hyperparathyroidism likely result in decreased activity of the parafibromin protein. Reduced parafibromin activity can cause increased cell proliferation, leading to the formation of tumors involving the parathyroid glands. Parathyroid tumors in people with familial isolated hyperparathyroidism are usually noncancerous (benign). The tumors cause the glands to be overactive, and this overactivity leads to the signs and symptoms of the condition. The mutations associated with familial isolated hyperparathyroidism are thought to have a less severe effect on protein function than those that cause hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome. Occasionally, individuals with familial isolated hyperparathyroidism later develop features of hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, although some never do. Familial isolated hyperparathyroidism caused by CDC73 gene mutations may be an early or mild form of hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome. "
221,CDH1 ,cadherin 1,"The CDH1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called epithelial cadherin or E-cadherin. This protein is found within the membrane that surrounds epithelial cells, which are the cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body, such as the inside of the eyelids and mouth. E-cadherin belongs to a family of proteins called cadherins whose function is to help neighboring cells stick to one another (cell adhesion) to form organized tissues. Another protein called p120-catenin, produced from the CTNND1 gene, helps keep E-cadherin in its proper place in the cell membrane, preventing it from being taken into the cell through a process called endocytosis and broken down prematurely.E-cadherin is one of the best-understood cadherin proteins. In addition to its role in cell adhesion, E-cadherin is involved in transmitting chemical signals within cells, controlling cell maturation and movement, and regulating the activity of certain genes. Interactions between the E-cadherin and p120-catenin proteins, in particular, are thought to be important for normal development of the head and face (craniofacial development), including the eyelids and teeth. E-cadherin also acts as a tumor suppressor protein, which means it prevents cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.","Blepharocheilodontic syndrome At least five inherited CDH1 gene mutations have been identified in people with blepharocheilodontic (BCD) syndrome. This disorder is present at birth and causes abnormalities mainly affecting the eyelids and mouth, including openings on both sides of the upper lip (bilateral cleft lip) and an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate). CDH1 gene mutations that cause BCD syndrome are thought to result in an abnormal E-cadherin protein that is quickly broken down. A shortage of E-cadherin protein impairs the interaction between E-cadherin and p120-catenin and affects craniofacial development, leading to the features of BCD syndrome. Despite the association of CDH1 gene mutations with increased cancer risk (see below), it is unclear whether people with BCD syndrome are at increased risk of developing cancer. "
222,CDH23 ,cadherin related 23,"The CDH23 gene provides instructions for making cadherin 23, a type of protein that helps cells stick together. Different versions of this protein are made in different cell types, including a short version in the retina, which is the light-sensitive layer in the back of the eye, and a longer version in the inner ear. Cadherin 23 interacts with other proteins in the cell membrane as part of a protein complex that is involved in cell attachment.Research suggests that the cadherin 23 protein complex helps to shape structures in the inner ear called hair bundles. These structures are made of stereocilia, which are hairlike projections that bend in response to sound waves. This bending motion is critical for converting sound waves to nerve impulses, which are then transmitted to the brain. Stereocilia are also elements of the vestibular system, the part of the inner ear that helps maintain the body's balance and orientation in space. Bending of these stereocilia is needed to transmit signals from the vestibular system to the brain.In the retina, the role of the cadherin 23 protein complex is less well understood. Studies suggest that it plays a critical role in the function of photoreceptor cells, which are specialized cells that detect light and color.","Nonsyndromic hearing loss Several dozen mutations in the CDH23 gene have been identified in people with nonsyndromic hearing loss, which is loss of hearing that is not associated with other signs and symptoms. Mutations in this gene cause a form of hearing loss designated as DFNB12. This type of hearing loss begins before a child learns to speak (prelingual) and is severe to profound.Most of the mutations that cause DFNB12 change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in cadherin 23. These mutations reduce but do not eliminate the function of this protein. The altered protein disrupts development of stereocilia in the inner ear, which leads to hearing loss.Researchers speculate that some children with apparently nonsyndromic hearing loss caused by a CDH23 mutation may actually have Usher syndrome (described below). A few children thought to have DFNB12 have developed the vision disorder retinitis pigmentosa later in life, which is characteristic of Usher syndrome. "
223,CDKL5 ,cyclin dependent kinase like 5,"The CDKL5 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in cells and tissues throughout the body. However, it is most active in the brain and is essential for normal brain development and function. There are five versions (isoforms) of the CDKL5 protein. These isoforms vary in length and in the tissues in which they are most abundant.Studies suggest that the CDKL5 protein is involved in the formation, growth, and movement (migration) of nerve cells (neurons), as well as cell division. It also plays a role in the transmission of chemical signals at the connections (synapses) between neurons.The CDKL5 protein acts as a kinase, which is an enzyme that changes the activity of other proteins by adding a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) at specific positions. It is possible that one of the proteins targeted by the CDKL5 protein is MeCP2, which is produced from the MECP2 gene. The MeCP2 protein plays important roles in the function of neurons and other brain cells and in the maintenance of neuronal synapses. Researchers have not determined which other proteins are targeted by the CDKL5 protein.","CDKL5 deficiency disorder At least 150 mutations in the CDKL5 gene have been found to cause CDKL5 deficiency disorder. This rare condition is characterized by seizures that begin in infancy, followed by significant delays in many aspects of development. Affected individuals have severe intellectual disability and most do not walk independently. About 90 percent of people diagnosed with CDKL5 deficiency disorder are female.CDKL5 deficiency disorder was previously classified as an atypical form of Rett syndrome. However, CDKL5 deficiency disorder is now considered a separate condition. Rett syndrome, which affects development in girls and women, results from mutations in the MECP2 gene. Because the CDKL5 and MeCP2 proteins may interact in the brain, the two disorders might be caused by a similar mechanism.Mutations in the CDKL5 gene reduce the amount of functional CDKL5 protein or alter its activity in neurons. A shortage (deficiency) of CDKL5 or impairment of its function disrupts brain development, but it is unclear how these changes cause the specific features of CDKL5 deficiency disorder.Most CDKL5 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the CDKL5 protein. This type of mutation occurs most often in a region of the protein called the kinase domain, which is essential for the protein's kinase function. Mutations in the kinase domain disrupt the ability of CDKL5 to add phosphate groups to other proteins. Compared with other types of mutation, these mutations are associated with more severe signs and symptoms of CDKL5 deficiency disorder.Other CDKL5 gene mutations alter different regions of the CDKL5 protein or lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the protein. Research has shown that mutations affecting parts of the protein other than the kinase domain tend to cause less severe signs and symptoms of CDKL5 deficiency disorder than other types of mutations. "
224,CDKN1B ,cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B,"The CDKN1B gene provides instructions for making a protein called p27. This protein is found in cells and tissues throughout the body. Within cells, p27 is located primarily in the nucleus, where it plays a critical role in controlling cell growth and division. It helps regulate the cell cycle, which is the cell's way of replicating itself in an organized, step-by-step fashion. Specifically, p27 normally blocks cells from entering the phase of the cell cycle when DNA is copied (replicated) in preparation for cell division. By blocking cell cycle progression, p27 prevents cells from dividing too quickly or at the wrong time. Based on this function, p27 is described as a tumor suppressor protein. Studies suggest that p27 is also involved in controlling cell differentiation, which is the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions.Because p27 plays such a key role in controlling cell division, its activity is tightly regulated. Regulation can occur through modification of the p27 protein's structure, its interaction with other proteins, or its localization within the cell. For example, when p27 is held (sequestered) in the fluid that surrounds the nucleus (the cytoplasm) instead of being transported into the nucleus, the protein is unavailable to block cell cycle progression. Researchers believe that p27 may have other functions in the cytoplasm, but these functions have not been well described.","Multiple endocrine neoplasia At least eight mutations in the CDKN1B gene have been found to cause a relatively rare form of multiple endocrine neoplasia called type 4. Multiple endocrine neoplasia typically involves the development of tumors in two or more of the body's hormone-producing glands, called endocrine glands. These tumors can be noncancerous or cancerous. The most common endocrine glands affected in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4 are the parathyroid glands and the pituitary gland, although additional endocrine glands and other organs can also be involved.Most of the CDKN1B gene mutations that cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4 change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the p27 protein. Some mutations impair the protein's ability to interact with regulatory proteins, while others lead to the production of an unstable version of p27 that is quickly broken down. Still other mutations prevent p27 from moving from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. All of these mutations reduce the amount of functional p27 that is available in the nucleus to regulate the cell cycle. Cells with a shortage of functional p27 can divide too quickly or in an uncontrolled way, forming a tumor. It is unclear why these tumors occur primarily in endocrine glands; studies suggest that certain endocrine cells may be particularly dependent on the p27 protein to control cell division. "
225,CDKN1C ,cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1C,"The CDKN1C gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps regulate growth. This protein acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it keeps cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way. It also is involved in controlling growth before birth, preventing the developing fetus from becoming too large.People inherit one copy of most genes from their mother and one copy from their father. Both copies are typically active, or ""turned on,"" in cells. However, the activity of the CDKN1C gene depends on which parent it was inherited from. In most tissues, the copy of the gene inherited from a person's mother (the maternally inherited copy) has much higher activity than the copy inherited from the father (the paternally inherited copy). This sort of parent-specific difference in gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting.CDKN1C is part of a cluster of genes on the short (p) arm of chromosome 11 that undergo genomic imprinting. A nearby region of DNA known as imprinting center 2 (IC2) or KvDMR controls the parent-specific genomic imprinting of CDKN1C and several other genes thought to help regulate growth. The IC2 region undergoes a process called methylation, which is a chemical reaction that attaches small molecules called methyl groups to certain segments of DNA. Methylation, which occurs during the formation of an egg or sperm cell, is a way of marking or ""stamping"" the parent of origin. The IC2 region is normally methylated only on the maternally inherited copy of chromosome 11.","Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that causes overgrowth and has other signs and symptoms that affect many parts of the body. At least half of all cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome result from changes in methylation of the IC2 region. Specifically, the maternally inherited copy of the IC2 region has too few methyl groups attached (hypomethylation). This abnormality disrupts the regulation of several genes that are normally controlled by IC2, including CDKN1C. Because this gene normally restrains cell growth and division, a reduction in its activity leads to overgrowth and the other features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.In a few cases, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome has been caused by deletions of a small amount of DNA from the maternally inherited copy of the IC2 region. Like abnormal methylation, these deletions disrupt the activity of several genes, including CDKN1C.Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome can also result from mutations within the maternally inherited copy of the CDKN1C gene. More than two dozen such mutations have been identified. Some of these genetic changes lead to an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the CDKN1C protein, while others alter single protein building blocks (amino acids) or delete a small number of amino acids from the protein. All of these mutations are described as ""loss-of-function"" because they alter the structure of the CDKN1C protein such that it can no longer control growth effectively. The resulting problems with growth regulation lead to overgrowth and the other features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. "
226,CDKN2A ,cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A,"The CDKN2A gene provides instructions for making several proteins. The most well-studied are the p16(INK4A) and the p14(ARF) proteins. Both function as tumor suppressors, which means they keep cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Both proteins are also involved in stopping cell division in older cells (senescence).The p16(INK4A) protein attaches (binds) to two other proteins called CDK4 and CDK6. These proteins help regulate the cell cycle, which is the cell's way of replicating itself in an organized, step-by-step fashion. CDK4 and CDK6 normally stimulate the cell to continue through the cycle and divide. However, binding of p16(INK4A) blocks CDK4's or CDK6's ability to stimulate cell cycle progression. In this way, p16(INK4A) controls cell division. Cells begin to produce p16(INK4A) when they are no longer able to undergo cell division.The p14(ARF) protein protects a different protein called p53 from being broken down. The p53 protein is an important tumor suppressor that is essential for regulating cell division, senescence, and self-destruction (apoptosis). By protecting p53, p14(ARF) also helps prevent tumor formation. The p14(ARF) and p53 proteins are often made in cells that are unable to undergo cell division.",Bladder cancer Genetics Home Reference provides information about bladder cancer. 
227,CDT1 ,chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1,"The CDT1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is important in the copying of a cell's DNA before the cell divides (a process known as DNA replication). The protein produced from this gene is one of a group of proteins known as the pre-replication complex. In a multi-step process, the components of this complex attach (bind) to certain regions of DNA known as origins of replication (or origins), where the process of DNA copying begins. When the pre-replication complex is attached to the origin, replication is able to begin at that location. This tightly controlled process, called replication licensing, helps ensure that DNA replication occurs only once per cell division and is required for cells to divide.","Meier-Gorlin syndrome Mutations in the CDT1 gene cause Meier-Gorlin syndrome, a condition characterized by short stature, underdeveloped kneecaps, and small ears. These mutations alter the CDT1 protein, typically by changing single protein building blocks (amino acids) or by leading to production of an abnormally short version of the CDT1 protein. As a result, assembly of the pre-replication complex is impaired, which disrupts replication licensing; however, it is not clear how a reduction in replication licensing leads to Meier-Gorlin syndrome. Researchers speculate that such a reduction delays the cell division process, which slows growth of the bones and other tissues during development. It is not known why development of the kneecaps and ears is particularly affected. "
228,CEBPA ,CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha,"The CEBPA gene provides instructions for making a protein called CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha. This protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity (expression) of certain genes. CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha is involved in the maturation (differentiation) of certain blood cells. It is also believed to act as a tumor suppressor, which means that it is involved in cellular mechanisms that help prevent the cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.","Familial acute myeloid leukemia with mutated CEBPA At least six mutations in the CEBPA gene have been identified in families with familial acute myeloid leukemia with mutated CEBPA, which is a form of a blood cancer known as acute myeloid leukemia. These inherited mutations are present throughout a person's life in virtually every cell in the body. The mutations result in a shorter version of CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha. This shortened protein is produced from one copy of the CEBPA gene in each cell, and it is believed to interfere with the tumor suppressor function of the normal protein produced from the second copy of the gene. Absence of the tumor suppressor function of CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha is believed to disrupt the regulation of blood cell production, leading to the uncontrolled production of abnormal cells that occurs in acute myeloid leukemia.In addition to the inherited mutation in one copy of the CEBPA gene in each cell, most individuals with familial acute myeloid leukemia with mutated CEBPA also acquire a mutation in the second copy of the CEBPA gene. The additional mutation, which is called a somatic mutation, is found only in the cancerous leukemia cells and is not inherited. The somatic CEBPA gene mutations that have been identified in leukemia cells generally decrease the DNA-binding ability of CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha. Researchers suggest that this second mutation may affect the normal differentiation of blood cells, although exactly how the mutation is involved in the development of acute myeloid leukemia is unclear. "
229,CEP57 ,centrosomal protein 57,"The CEP57 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not completely understood. Within cells, the CEP57 protein is located in structures called centrosomes. Centrosomes have a role in cell division and the assembly of microtubules. Microtubules are fibers that help cells maintain their shape, assist in the process of cell division, and are essential for the movement (transport) of materials within cells. CEP57 seems especially important for the organization and stability of specialized microtubules called spindle microtubules, which are important for cell division. Before cells divide, they copy all of their chromosomes. Spindle microtubules, which are produced by centrosomes, attach to the duplicated chromosomes and pull one copy of each to opposite ends of the cell so that each new cell contains one complete set of chromosomes.The CEP57 protein is also involved in the transport of certain molecules along microtubules, particularly a protein called fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). FGF2 is an important signaling molecule that helps regulate growth and development of cells and tissues, and its transport inside the cell is important for relaying signals that instruct the cell how to function.","Mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome At least three CEP57 gene mutations have been found to cause mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA) syndrome type 2. This condition is characterized by cells with abnormal numbers of chromosomes, a situation known as aneuploidy. Affected individuals grow slowly before and after birth and may have mild intellectual disability and other health problems.CEP57 gene mutations involved in MVA syndrome type 2 likely reduce the amount of functional CEP57 protein in cells. It is unclear how these changes lead to the features of the condition. Researchers speculate that impairment of the protein's role in stabilizing spindle microtubules may prevent the normal separation of chromosomes during cell division, leading to aneuploidy. Although they are unsure how CEP57 gene mutations lead to the other features of MVA syndrome type 2, some suggest that the shortage of functional CEP57 protein prevents proper transport of FGF2, which may impair cell signaling and lead to problems with growth and development. "
230,CEP290 ,centrosomal protein 290,"The CEP290 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is present in many types of cells. Although this protein's function is not well understood, studies suggest that it plays an important role in cell structures called centrosomes and cilia. Centrosomes are involved in cell division and the assembly of microtubules, which are proteins that transport materials in cells and help the cell maintain its shape. Cilia are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. Cilia are involved in cell movement and many different chemical signaling pathways. They are also necessary for the perception of sensory input (such as vision, hearing, and smell).","Leber congenital amaurosis At least 35 mutations in the CEP290 gene have been found to cause Leber congenital amaurosis. Mutations in this gene account for 15 to 22 percent of all cases of this condition.A particular genetic change, written as 2991+1655A>G, is the most common CEP290 gene mutation associated with Leber congenital amaurosis. This mutation reduces the production of functional CEP290 protein to very low levels in cells. Other genetic changes responsible for this disorder result in the production of abnormally short, nonfunctional versions of the CEP290 protein.It is unclear how mutations in the CEP290 gene cause the characteristic features of Leber congenital amaurosis. A shortage of the CEP290 protein clearly affects the development of the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. Light-sensing cells (photoreceptors) in the retina contain cilia, which are essential for normal vision. Abnormalities involving these cilia may lead to the severe, early visual impairment characteristic of Leber congenital amaurosis. "
231,CFH ,complement factor H,"The CFH gene provides instructions for making a protein called complement factor H. This protein helps regulate a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (such as bacteria and viruses), trigger an inflammatory response, and remove debris from cells and tissues. This system must be carefully regulated so it targets only unwanted materials and does not damage the body's healthy cells. Complement factor H, together with several related proteins, protects healthy cells by preventing the complement system from being turned on (activated) when it is not needed.","C3 glomerulopathy Several mutations in the CFH gene have been found to cause a rare form of kidney disease called C3 glomerulopathy. This disorder damages the kidneys and can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a life-threatening condition that prevents the kidneys from filtering fluids and waste products from the body effectively.Most of the CFH gene mutations that cause C3 glomerulopathy change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in complement factor H. These mutations prevent cells from making this protein or lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of the protein. The resulting shortage (deficiency) of complement factor H overactivates the complement system, which damages structures called glomeruli in the kidneys. These structures are clusters of tiny blood vessels that help filter waste products from the blood. Damage to glomeruli prevents the kidneys from filtering waste products normally and can lead to ESRD.Several other changes involving the CFH gene do not cause C3 glomerulopathy directly but appear to increase the likelihood of developing the disorder. The best-studied of these gene variations (polymorphisms) is written as Tyr402His or Y402H. Complement factor H usually has the amino acid tyrosine (Tyr/Y) at position 402, but sometimes it has the amino acid histidine (His/H) instead. People with C3 glomerulopathy are more likely than people in the general population to have histidine at this position. The version of complement factor H with histidine at position 402 is less effective at regulating the complement system on cell surfaces than the version with tyrosine at position 402, which may help explain the increased disease risk. "
232,CFHR5 ,complement factor H related 5,"The CFHR5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called complement factor H-related 5. The precise function of this protein is unknown. However, its structure is similar to that of a protein called complement factor H (which is produced from the CFH gene). This similarity provides clues to the probable function of complement factor H-related 5.Complement factor H regulates a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (such as bacteria and viruses), trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. This system must be carefully regulated so it targets only unwanted materials and does not damage the body's healthy cells. Complement factor H helps to protect healthy cells by preventing the complement system from being turned on (activated) when it is not needed. Studies suggest that complement factor H-related 5 also plays a role in controlling the complement system.","C3 glomerulopathy Several mutations in the CFHR5 gene have been found to cause a rare form of kidney disease called C3 glomerulopathy. This disorder damages the kidneys and can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a life-threatening condition that prevents the kidneys from filtering fluids and waste products from the body effectively.The most common CFHR5 gene mutation has been identified in people from the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. This genetic change abnormally copies (duplicates) regions of the CFHR5 gene known as exons 2 and 3. The duplication alters the structure and function of complement factor H-related 5, preventing it from regulating the complement system effectively. As a result, the complement system becomes overactive, which damages structures called glomeruli in the kidneys. These structures are clusters of tiny blood vessels that help filter waste products from the blood. Damage to glomeruli prevents the kidneys from filtering waste products normally and can lead to ESRD.Several other changes involving the CFHR5 gene do not cause C3 glomerulopathy directly but appear to increase the likelihood of developing the disorder. It is unclear how variations in this gene affect the regulation of the complement system, and researchers are still working to determine how these genetic changes contribute to disease risk. "
233,CFI ,complement factor I,"The CFI gene provides instructions for making a protein called complement factor I. This protein helps regulate a part of the body's immune response known as the complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (such as bacteria and viruses), trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. This system must be carefully regulated so it targets only unwanted materials and does not attack the body's healthy cells. Complement factor I and several related proteins protect healthy cells by preventing activation of the complement system when it is not needed.","Complement factor I deficiency At least 10 mutations in the CFI gene have been identified in people with complement factor I deficiency, a disorder characterized by immune system dysfunction. The mutations result in abnormal, nonfunctional, or absent complement factor I.The lack (deficiency) of functional complement factor I protein allows uncontrolled activation of the complement system. The unregulated activity of the complement system decreases blood levels of another complement protein called C3, reducing the immune system's ability to fight infections. In addition, the immune system may malfunction and attack its own tissues, resulting in autoimmune disorders. "
234,CFTR ,cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator,"The CFTR gene provides instructions for making a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. This protein functions as a channel across the membrane of cells that produce mucus, sweat, saliva, tears, and digestive enzymes. The channel transports negatively charged particles called chloride ions into and out of cells. The transport of chloride ions helps control the movement of water in tissues, which is necessary for the production of thin, freely flowing mucus. Mucus is a slippery substance that lubricates and protects the lining of the airways, digestive system, reproductive system, and other organs and tissues.The CFTR protein also regulates the function of other channels, such as those that transport positively charged particles called sodium ions across cell membranes. These channels are necessary for the normal function of organs such as the lungs and pancreas.","Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens About 80 CFTR mutations have been identified in males with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens. Most affected males have a mild mutation in at least one copy of the gene in each cell. These mutations allow the CFTR protein to retain some of its function. Some affected males have a mild mutation in one copy of the CFTR gene in each cell and a more severe, cystic fibrosis-causing mutation in the other copy of the gene.Mutations in the CFTR gene disrupt the function of the chloride channel, preventing the usual flow of chloride ions and water into and out of cells. As a result, cells in the male genital tract produce mucus that is abnormally thick and sticky. This mucus clogs the tubes that carry sperm from the testes (the vas deferens) as they are forming, causing them to deteriorate before birth. Without the vas deferens, sperm cannot be transported from the testes to become part of semen. Men with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens are unable to father children (infertile) unless they use assisted reproductive technologies. "
235,CHAT ,choline O-acetyltransferase,"The CHAT gene provides instructions for making a protein called choline acetyltransferase. This protein is located at the ends of nerve cells in specialized areas called presynaptic terminals. Choline acetyltransferase facilitates the production of a molecule called acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is essential for normal muscle movement. When acetylcholine is released from the presynaptic terminal, it attaches (binds) to a receptor protein located in the membrane of muscle cells. When acetylcholine binds to its receptor protein, specialized channels in the receptor then open, allowing certain charged atoms (ions) to flow into and out of muscle cells. The flow of these ions allows for muscle contraction and relaxation, resulting in muscle movement.","Congenital myasthenic syndrome More than 30 mutations in the CHAT gene have been found to cause congenital myasthenic syndrome. Most of these mutations replace single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the CHAT gene. The mutations lead to decreased production of choline acetyltransferase or the production of a protein with decreased ability to aid in the production of acetylcholine. The resulting lack of acetylcholine decreases the availability of open receptors, impairing ion flow through muscle cells. A reduction in muscle cell ion flow decreases muscle movement leading to muscle weakness characteristic of congenital myasthenic syndrome. In addition, people with congenital myasthenic syndrome who have mutations in the CHAT gene are more likely than affected individuals with mutations in other genes to have short pauses in breathing (apnea), but the cause for this association is unclear. "
236,CHD2 ,chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 2,"The CHD2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called chromodomain DNA helicase protein 2. This protein is found in cells throughout the body and regulates gene activity (expression) through a process known as chromatin remodeling. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and proteins that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. When DNA is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when DNA is loosely packed. Chromodomain DNA helicase protein 2 appears to play an important role in the brain, although its function is not well understood. Research suggests that it may help control development or functioning of nerve cells (neurons).","CHD2 myoclonic encephalopathy At least 30 mutations in the CHD2 gene have been found to cause CHD2 myoclonic encephalopathy, a condition characterized by recurrent seizures (epilepsy), abnormal brain function (encephalopathy), and intellectual disability beginning in childhood. About half of these mutations delete pieces of DNA from the CHD2 gene. These and other CHD2 gene mutations either prevent the production of any chromodomain DNA helicase protein 2 or lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of the protein. As a result, chromatin remodeling and gene expression normally regulated by the chromodomain DNA helicase protein 2 are disrupted. It is unclear why CHD2 gene mutations seem to only affect nerve cells in the brain or how they lead to the signs and symptoms of CHD2 myoclonic encephalopathy. "
237,CHD7 ,chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7,"The CHD7 gene provides instructions for making a protein called chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7. This protein is found in many parts of the body before birth, including the eye, the inner ear, and the brain. In the brain, the CHD7 protein is active in several areas, including a bundle of nerve cells (neurons) called the olfactory bulb that is critical for the perception of odors.The CHD7 protein belongs to a family of proteins that are thought to play a role in the organization of chromatin. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and protein that packages DNA into chromosomes. The CHD7 protein regulates the activity (expression) of several other genes through a process known as chromatin remodeling. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. When DNA is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when DNA is loosely packed. Researchers are working to determine which genes the CHD7 protein regulates.","CHARGE syndrome Mutations in the CHD7 gene cause CHARGE syndrome, a disorder that affects many areas of the body. CHARGE is an abbreviation for several of the features common in the disorder: coloboma, heart defect, atresia choanae (also known as choanal atresia), growth retardation, genital abnormality, and ear abnormality. More than 600 mutations that can cause CHARGE syndrome have been identified, and they occur throughout the CHD7 gene. Most of these mutations lead to the production of an abnormal CHD7 protein that is broken down prematurely. Shortage of this protein is thought to disrupt chromatin remodeling and the regulation of gene expression. Changes in gene expression during embryonic development likely cause the signs and symptoms of CHARGE syndrome. "
238,CHD8 ,chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 8,"The CHD8 gene provides instructions for making a protein that regulates gene activity (expression) by a process known as chromatin remodeling. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and protein that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. When DNA is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when DNA is loosely packed. Chromatin remodeling is one way gene expression is regulated during development.The CHD8 protein is thought to affect the expression of many other genes that are involved in brain development before birth. In particular, the CHD8 protein and the genes it regulates likely help control the development of neural progenitor cells, which give rise to nerve cells (neurons), and the growth and division (proliferation) and maturation (differentiation) of neurons. In this way, the CHD8 protein helps to control the number of neurons in the brain and prevent overgrowth.","Autism spectrum disorder More than 30 CHD8 gene mutations have been identified in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a varied condition characterized by impaired social skills, communication problems, and repetitive behaviors. Mutations in the CHD8 gene impair the function of the CHD8 protein, and may interfere with its ability to help control the number and growth of neurons in the brain. Excess neurons and overgrowth in parts of the brain are associated with ASD, but the relationship between these abnormalities and the behavioral features of the disorder is unknown. "
239,CHM ,"CHM, Rab escort protein 1","The CHM gene provides instructions for producing the Rab escort protein-1 (REP-1), which is active (expressed) throughout the body. As an escort protein, REP-1 attaches (binds) to one of a number of Rab proteins. Following a chemical modification, REP-1 then directs the Rab protein to the membrane of one of the cell's compartments (organelles). While attached to the membrane, the Rab protein plays a role in directing the movement of proteins and organelles within cells (intracellular trafficking). After the Rab protein has reached its destination, it is released by REP-1 which then attaches to another Rab protein to begin the process again.","Choroideremia More than 140 mutations in the CHM gene have been found to cause choroideremia. Nearly all of these mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional REP-1 protein. Other gene mutations result in a decrease in the protein's function or delete part or all of the gene and abolish REP-1 protein production. A lack of normal REP-1 disrupts the ability of Rab proteins to aid in intracellular trafficking. The immobility of proteins and organelles within the cell cause the cell to die prematurely.The REP-1 protein is active (expressed) throughout the body, as is a similar protein, REP-2. Research suggests that when REP-1 is absent or not functioning properly, REP-2 can perform the protein escort duties of REP-1 in many of the body's tissues. Very little REP-2 protein is present in the light sensitive-tissue at the back of the eye (the retina), however, so it cannot compensate for the loss of REP-1 in this tissue. Loss of REP-1 function and subsequent misplacement of Rab proteins within the cells of the retina causes the progressive vision loss characteristic of choroideremia. "
240,CHMP2B ,charged multivesicular body protein 2B,"The CHMP2B gene provides instructions for making a protein called charged multivesicular body protein 2B. This protein is active in the brain, where it appears to be essential for the survival of nerve cells (neurons).Charged multivesicular body protein 2B forms one part (subunit) of a group of proteins known as the ESCRT-III complex. This complex helps transport other proteins from the cell membrane to the interior of the cell, a process known as endocytosis. In particular, the ESCRT-III complex is involved in the endocytosis of proteins that need to be broken down (degraded) by the cell. The complex helps sort these proteins into structures called multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which deliver them to lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments within cells that digest and recycle many different types of molecules.Charged multivesicular body protein 2B is regulated by a segment at one end of the protein known as the C-terminal domain. This domain usually keeps the protein turned off (inactive). The inactive protein is unable to interact with other subunits of the ESCRT-III complex, which prevents the complex from forming when it is not needed. The C-terminal domain also plays an important role in disassembling the ESCRT-III complex through its interaction with a protein called vacuolar protein sorting 4 (Vps4).","CHMP2B-related frontotemporal dementia Several changes in the CHMP2B gene have been identified in people with frontotemporal dementia. At least two of these genetic changes are thought to be mutations that cause the disease. It is unclear whether the other genetic changes also cause disease; they may be rare variations that are unrelated to the development of frontotemporal dementia.Most people with CHMP2B-related frontotemporal dementia are members of a single, large Danish family. Affected individuals in this family have a particular mutation, written as 532-1G>C, that changes a single DNA building block (base pair) in the CHMP2B gene. This mutation leads to the production of two abnormal versions of charged multivesicular body protein 2B, both of which are missing the C-terminal domain.Without the C-terminal domain, charged multivesicular body protein 2B is constantly turned on (active) as part of the ESCRT-III complex. It cannot interact with Vps4, so the complex cannot be disassembled when it is no longer needed. As a result, the ESCRT-III complex builds up within cells and disrupts the transport and degradation of other proteins. These abnormalities ultimately lead to the death of neurons in the brain.A gradual loss of neurons throughout the brain is characteristic of CHMP2B-related frontotemporal dementia. Many of the features of this disease result from neuronal death in regions near the front of the brain called the frontal and temporal lobes. The frontal lobes are involved in reasoning, planning, judgment, and problem-solving, while the temporal lobes help process hearing, speech, memory, and emotion. It is unclear why the signs and symptoms of this disease are related primarily to the frontal and temporal lobes. "
241,CHN1 ,chimerin 1,"The CHN1 gene provides instructions for making two very similar proteins called α1-chimaerin and α2-chimaerin. These proteins play an important role in the early development of the nervous system. In particular, they help regulate complex chemical signaling pathways during the formation and development of nerve cells (neurons). These proteins help guide the growth of axons and dendrites, which are specialized extensions of neurons that transmit and receive nerve impulses throughout the nervous system.The CHN1 proteins, particularly α2-chimaerin, appear to be critical for the formation of certain nerves in the head and face. Specifically, they are necessary for the development and function of cranial nerve VI and, to a lesser extent, cranial nerve III. These nerves emerge from the brain and control several of the muscles that surround the eyes (extraocular muscles). The extraocular muscles direct eye movement and determine the position of the eyes.","Isolated Duane retraction syndrome At least seven mutations in the CHN1 gene have been identified in families with isolated Duane retraction syndrome. Researchers believe that the features of this condition result from changes in one of the two versions of the CHN1 protein, α2-chimaerin. Each identified mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in α2-chimaerin. Although several mutations also affect α1-chimaerin, researchers think that changes in α1-chimaerin alone do not cause isolated Duane retraction syndrome.CHN1 mutations alter the structure and function of α2-chimaerin in the developing nervous system. These genetic changes appear to overactivate the protein, which disrupts the normal growth of neurons in certain parts of the brain. As a result, cranial nerves VI and III and the extraocular muscles they control do not develop normally. Abnormal development and function of these muscles leads to the characteristic features of isolated Duane retraction syndrome, including restricted eye movement and related problems with vision. "
242,CHRNA2 ,cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 2 subunit,"The CHRNA2 gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of a larger protein called a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Each nAChR protein is made up of a combination of five subunits, usually two alpha (α) and three beta (β) subunits. Many different combinations are possible, and the characteristics of each nAChR protein depend on which subunits it contains. The CHRNA2 gene is responsible for producing a subunit known as α2. Little is known about the specific function of nAChR proteins made with this subunit.In the brain, nAChR proteins are widely distributed and play an important role in chemical signaling between nerve cells (neurons). The proteins act as channels, allowing charged atoms (ions) including calcium, sodium, and potassium to cross the cell membrane. These channels open when attached to a brain chemical (neurotransmitter) called acetylcholine. The channels also open in response to nicotine, the addictive substance in tobacco.Communication between neurons depends on neurotransmitters, which are released from one neuron and taken up by neighboring neurons. The release and uptake of these chemicals are tightly regulated to ensure that signals are passed efficiently and accurately between neurons. Researchers believe that nAChR channels play an important role in controlling the normal release and uptake of neurotransmitters.A wide range of brain functions depend on nAChR channels, including sleep and arousal, fatigue, anxiety, attention, pain perception, and memory. The channels are also active before birth, which suggests that they are involved in early brain development. At least one drug that targets nAChR channels in the brain has been developed to help people quit smoking; other medications targeting these channels are under study for the treatment of schizophrenia, Alzheimer disease, and pain.","Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy At least one mutation in the CHRNA2 gene has been found to cause autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE). It appears that changes in this gene are a very rare cause of ADNFLE. Some researchers suspect that the known mutation actually causes a separate form of epilepsy with features similar to ADNFLE.The identified CHRNA2 mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the α2 subunit of nAChR channels. Specifically, it replaces the amino acid isoleucine with the amino acid asparagine at protein position 279 (written as Ile279Asn or I279N). This mutation makes the channels more sensitive to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, allowing them to open more easily than usual. The resulting increase in ion flow across the cell membrane alters the release of neurotransmitters, which changes signaling between neurons. Researchers believe that the overexcitement of certain neurons in the brain triggers the abnormal brain activity associated with seizures. It is unclear why the seizures seen in ADNFLE start in the frontal lobes of the brain and occur most often during sleep. "
243,CHRNA4 ,cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 4 subunit,"The CHRNA4 gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of a larger protein called a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Each nAChR protein is made up of a combination of five subunits, usually two alpha (α) and three beta (β) subunits. Many different combinations are possible, and the characteristics of each nAChR protein depend on which subunits it contains. In the brain, nAChR proteins most commonly consist of two α4 subunits and three β2 subunits. The CHRNA4 gene is responsible for producing the α4 subunit.In the brain, nAChR proteins are widely distributed and play an important role in chemical signaling between nerve cells (neurons). The nAChR proteins act as channels, allowing charged atoms (ions) including calcium, sodium, and potassium to cross the cell membrane. These channels open when attached to a brain chemical (neurotransmitter) called acetylcholine. The channels also open in response to nicotine, the addictive substance in tobacco.Communication between neurons depends on neurotransmitters, which are released from one neuron and taken up by neighboring neurons. The release and uptake of these chemicals are tightly regulated to ensure that signals are passed efficiently and accurately between neurons. Researchers believe that nAChR channels play an important role in controlling the normal release and uptake of neurotransmitters.A wide range of brain functions depend on nAChR channels, including sleep and arousal, fatigue, anxiety, attention, pain perception, and memory. The channels are also active before birth, which suggests that they are involved in early brain development. At least one drug that targets nAChR channels in the brain has been developed to help people quit smoking; other medications targeting these channels are under study for the treatment of schizophrenia, Alzheimer disease, and pain.","Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy At least four mutations in the CHRNA4 gene have been identified in people with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE). Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the α4 subunit of nAChR channels; one mutation inserts an extra amino acid into the α4 subunit.CHRNA4 mutations make nAChR channels more sensitive to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, allowing the channels to open more easily than usual. The resulting increase in ion flow across the cell membrane alters the release of neurotransmitters, which changes signaling between neurons. Researchers believe that the overexcitement of certain neurons in the brain triggers the abnormal brain activity associated with seizures. It is unclear why the seizures seen in ADNFLE start in the frontal lobes of the brain and occur most often during sleep. "
244,CHRNB2 ,cholinergic receptor nicotinic beta 2 subunit,"The CHRNB2 gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of a larger protein called a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Each nAChR protein is made up of a combination of five subunits, usually two alpha (α) and three beta (β) subunits. Many different combinations are possible, and the characteristics of each nAChR protein depend on which subunits it contains. In the brain, nAChR proteins most commonly consist of two α4 subunits and three β2 subunits. The CHRNB2 gene is responsible for producing the β2 subunit.In the brain, nAChR proteins are widely distributed and play an important role in chemical signaling between nerve cells (neurons). The nAChR proteins act as channels, allowing charged atoms (ions) including calcium, sodium, and potassium to cross the cell membrane. These channels open when attached to a brain chemical (neurotransmitter) called acetylcholine. The channels also open in response to nicotine, the addictive substance in tobacco.Communication between neurons depends on neurotransmitters, which are released from one neuron and taken up by neighboring neurons. The release and uptake of these chemicals are tightly regulated to ensure that signals are passed efficiently and accurately between neurons. Researchers believe that nAChR channels play an important role in controlling the normal release and uptake of neurotransmitters.A wide range of brain functions depend on nAChR channels, including sleep and arousal, fatigue, anxiety, attention, pain perception, and memory. The channels are also active before birth, which suggests that they are involved in early brain development. At least one drug that targets nAChR channels in the brain has been developed to help people quit smoking; other medications targeting these channels are under study for the treatment of schizophrenia, Alzheimer disease, and pain.","Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy At least three mutations in the CHRNB2 gene have been identified in people with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE). Each of these mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the β2 subunit of nAChR channels.CHRNB2 mutations make nAChR channels more sensitive to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, allowing the channels to open more easily than usual. The resulting increase in ion flow across the cell membrane alters the release of neurotransmitters, which changes signaling between neurons. Researchers believe that the overexcitement of certain neurons in the brain triggers the abnormal brain activity associated with seizures. It is unclear why the seizures seen in ADNFLE start in the frontal lobes of the brain and occur most often during sleep. "
245,CHRNE ,cholinergic receptor nicotinic epsilon subunit,"The CHRNE gene provides instructions for making the epsilon (ε) component (subunit) of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) protein. The AChR protein is found in the membrane of skeletal muscle cells and plays a critical role in the neuromuscular junction, which is the area where signaling between nerve and muscle cells occurs. Signaling between nerve and muscle cells is necessary for movement. The AChR protein consists of five subunits, each of which is produced from a different gene. The subunits are assembled into the AChR protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, a cell structure involved in protein processing and transport, before being transported to the cell membrane. There are two major forms of the AChR protein, a fetal type that is present before birth and an adult type. The ε subunit is found only in the adult AChR protein. At about the 33rd week of pregnancy, the ε subunit replaces the gamma (γ) subunit (found only in fetal AChR) to form adult AChR protein.","Congenital myasthenic syndrome More than 90 mutations in the CHRNE gene have been found to cause congenital myasthenic syndrome. Most of these mutations replace one DNA building block (nucleotide) in the gene, but other mutations add or delete small sections of DNA. These mutations can lead to the production of an altered ε subunit. A change in the ε subunit leads to an increase in AChR protein signaling or a decrease in AChR protein signaling, which impairs cell-to-cell communication at the neuromuscular junction. Decreased signaling can lead to a decrease in muscle movement and cause weakness, while an increase in signaling can damage muscle cells and cause weakness. Problems with communication between nerve and muscle cells can lead to the signs and symptoms of congenital myasthenic syndrome, including muscle weakness and delayed development of motor skills such as crawling and walking. Some people with CHRNE mutations seem to have a milder course of the disease compared with other affected individuals, likely because the fetal γ subunit (active at low levels after birth) can partially compensate for the lack of ε subunit in the adult AChR protein. "
246,CHRNG ,cholinergic receptor nicotinic gamma subunit,"The CHRNG gene provides instructions for making the gamma (γ) protein component (subunit) of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) protein. The AChR protein is found in the membrane of skeletal muscle cells and is critical for signaling between nerve and muscle cells. Signaling between these cells is necessary for movement. The AChR protein consists of five subunits, each of which is produced from a different gene. The subunits are assembled into the AChR protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, a cell structure involved in protein processing and transport, before being transported to the cell membrane. The γ subunit is found only in the fetal AChR protein. At about the thirty-third week of pregnancy, the γ subunit is replaced by the epsilon (ε) subunit, which is produced by the CHRNE gene, to form the adult AChR protein.","Multiple pterygium syndrome At least 14 mutations in the CHRNG gene have been found to cause multiple pterygium syndrome, a condition characterized by webbing of the skin (pterygium) and a lack of muscle movement (akinesia) before birth. These mutations include replacing, adding, or deleting DNA building blocks (nucleotides). CHRNG gene mutations result in an impaired or missing γ subunit. The severity of the CHRNG gene mutation influences the severity of the condition. Typically, mutations that prevent the production of any γ subunit will result in lethal multiple pterygium syndrome, which is fatal before birth, while mutations that allow the production of some γ subunit will lead to the milder form of this condition called multiple pterygium syndrome, Escobar type. A shortage of a functional γ subunit prevents the fetal AChR protein from being assembled or properly placed in the muscle cell membrane. As a result, the fetal AChR protein cannot function and the communication between nerve and muscle cells in the developing fetus is impaired. A lack of signaling between nerve and muscle cells leads to akinesia and pterygium before birth, and many of the other signs and symptoms of multiple pterygium syndrome. "
247,CHST3 ,carbohydrate sulfotransferase 3,"The CHST3 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase 1 or C6ST-1. This enzyme has an important role in the development and maintenance of the skeleton. In particular, it is essential for the normal development of cartilage, which is a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears.The C6ST-1 enzyme modifies molecules called chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, which are abundant in cartilage and give this tissue its rubbery, gel-like consistency. The C6ST-1 enzyme carries out a process known as sulfation, in which a chemical group called a sulfate is transferred from one chemical compound to another. Specifically, the enzyme takes sulfate from a molecule called 3'-phosphoadenyl-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) and adds it to a specific location on chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Sulfation of these molecules is a critical step in cartilage formation.","CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia At least 24 mutations in the CHST3 gene have been found to cause CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia, a condition characterized by progressive bone and joint abnormalities. Most of the mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the C6ST-1 enzyme. Other mutations result in the production of an abnormally short version of the enzyme. Each of these genetic changes reduces or eliminates the activity of C6ST-1, preventing it from transferring sulfate groups to chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Defective sulfation of these molecules disrupts the normal development of cartilage and bone, resulting in short stature, joint dislocations, and the other features of CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia. "
248,CIITA ,class II major histocompatibility complex transactivator,"The CIITA gene provides instructions for making a protein that primarily helps control the activity (transcription) of genes called major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes. Transcription is the first step in the production of proteins, and CIITA is critical for the production of specialized immune proteins called MHC class II proteins from these genes. The CIITA protein coordinates various proteins to turn on MHC class II gene transcription and allow the production of MHC class II proteins.MHC class II proteins are found on the surface of several types of immune cells, including white blood cells (lymphocytes) that are involved in immune reactions. These proteins play an important role in the body's immune response to foreign invaders, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. To help the body recognize and fight infections, MHC class II proteins bind to fragments of proteins (peptides) from foreign invaders so that other specialized immune system cells can interact with them. When these immune system cells recognize the peptides as harmful, they trigger the lymphocytes and other immune cells to launch immune responses to get rid of the foreign invaders.The CIITA protein also appears to play a role in enhancing the transcription of MHC class I genes, which provide instructions for making immune system proteins called MHC class I proteins. Like MHC class II proteins, MHC class I proteins attach to peptides from foreign invaders and present them to specific immune system cells. These cells then attack the foreign invaders to rid them from the body. While the CIITA protein is able to help promote MHC class I gene activity, it is not the primary regulator of these genes. Other proteins play a more prominent role in their transcription.","Bare lymphocyte syndrome type II More than a dozen mutations in the CIITA gene have been found to cause an immune system disorder called bare lymphocyte syndrome type II (BLS II). BLS II is a type of combined immunodeficiency (CID), in which affected individuals have virtually no immune protection from foreign invaders. Consequently, individuals with BLS II have persistent infections in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary tracts, which can be life-threatening.CIITA gene mutations involved in BLS II result in a lack of functioning CIITA protein. A shortage of CIITA to coordinate the factors that turn on MHC class II gene transcription prevents production of MHC class II proteins. Consequently, lymphocytes and other immune cells lack any MHC class II proteins on their surface, and the body has difficulty getting rid of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, leading to the persistent infections characteristic of BLS II. "
249,CISD2 ,CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2,"The CISD2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in the outer membrane of cell structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria are involved in a wide variety of cellular activities, including energy production, chemical signaling, and regulation of cell growth and division. The exact function of the CISD2 protein is unknown, but it is thought to help keep mitochondria functioning normally.","Wolfram syndrome At least one mutation in the CISD2 gene has been found to cause Wolfram syndrome. This condition is characterized by a lack of insulin leading to increased blood sugar (diabetes mellitus), a degeneration of nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain (optic atrophy), and a number of other features involving the urinary tract, the brain, and hearing. People with this CISD2 gene mutation also experience gastrointestinal ulcers and excessive bleeding after injury.The CISD2 gene mutation that causes Wolfram syndrome replaces the amino acid glutamic acid with the amino acid glutamine at position 37 in the CISD2 protein (written as Glu37Gln or E37Q). This mutation results in an abnormally small, nonfunctional CISD2 protein. As a result, the function of the mitochondria is impaired and they eventually break down. Since the mitochondria provide energy to cells, the loss of mitochondria leads to decreased energy for cells. Cells that do not have enough energy to function will eventually die. Cells with high energy demands, such as nerve cells in the brain, eyes, or gastrointestinal tract, are most susceptible to cell death due to reduced energy. The gradual loss of cells in various body systems likely causes the signs and symptoms of Wolfram syndrome. When Wolfram syndrome is caused by CISD2 gene mutations, it is sometimes referred to as Wolfram syndrome type 2. "
250,CLCF1 ,cardiotrophin like cytokine factor 1,"The CLCF1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1). This protein partners with a similar protein called cytokine receptor-like factor 1 (CRLF1), which is produced from the CRLF1 gene. Together, these two proteins form a unit known as the CRLF1/CLCF1 protein complex. This complex attaches (binds) to a receptor protein known as the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) on the surface of many types of cells. When the CRLF1/CLCF1 protein complex is bound to CNTFR, it triggers signaling inside the cell that affects cell development and function.The CNTFR signaling pathway is primarily involved in the development and maintenance of the nervous system. It promotes the survival of nerve cells (neurons), particularly nerve cells that control muscle movement (motor neurons). The CNTFR pathway also plays a role in a part of the nervous system called the sympathetic nervous system, specifically in the regulation of sweating in response to temperature changes and other factors. This signaling pathway appears to be critical for the normal development and maturation of nerve cells that control the activity of sweat glands.Studies suggest that the CNTFR signaling pathway also has functions outside the nervous system. It may be involved in the body's inflammatory response, which helps fight infection and facilitate tissue repair following an injury. This pathway may also be important for the development and maintenance of bone tissue. However, little is known about the role of CNTFR signaling in these processes.","Cold-induced sweating syndrome At least four mutations in the CLCF1 gene have been reported to cause cold-induced sweating syndrome, a rare condition characterized by problems with regulating body temperature and other abnormalities affecting many parts of the body. When this condition is caused by CLCF1 gene mutations, it is known as CISS2.Mutations in the CLCF1 gene lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of the CLCF1 protein. The defective protein is unable to interact with the CLRF1 protein and bind to CNTFR, which disables the CNTFR signaling pathway.Researchers believe that a failure of CNTFR signaling underlies the major features of cold-induced sweating syndrome. A loss of this signaling pathway during sympathetic nervous system development may help explain the abnormal sweating that is characteristic of this condition, including unusual sweating patterns and related problems with body temperature regulation. The CNTFR pathway's involvement in motor neuron development and bone development provides clues to some of the other signs and symptoms of the disorder, including distinctive facial features, facial muscle weakness, and skeletal abnormalities. However, little is known about how a lack of CNTFR signaling leads to these varied features. "
251,CLCN1 ,chloride voltage-gated channel 1,"The CLCN1 gene provides instructions for making a type of protein called a chloride channel. These channels, which transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions), play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.The CLCN1 gene provides instructions for making a chloride channel called ClC-1. These channels are found only in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For the body to move normally, skeletal muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. Muscle contraction and relaxation are controlled by the flow of certain ions into and out of muscle cells. ClC-1 channels, which span the cell membrane, control the flow of chloride ions into these cells. This influx stabilizes the cells' electrical charge, which prevents muscles from contracting abnormally.ClC-1 channels are made of two identical protein subunits, each produced from the CLCN1 gene. Although each subunit forms a separate opening (pore) that allows chloride ions to pass through, the two proteins work together to regulate the flow of chloride ions into skeletal muscle cells.","Myotonia congenita More than 150 mutations in the CLCN1 gene have been identified in people with myotonia congenita. Most of these mutations cause the autosomal recessive form of the disorder, which is known as Becker disease. Autosomal recessive inheritance means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. Becker disease results when CLCN1 mutations change the structure or function of both protein subunits that make up the ClC-1 channel. The altered channels greatly reduce the flow of chloride ions into skeletal muscle cells, which triggers prolonged muscle contractions. Abnormally sustained muscle contractions are the hallmark of myotonia.CLCN1 mutations also cause the autosomal dominant form of myotonia congenita, which is known as Thomsen disease. Autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Studies suggest that the CLCN1 mutations responsible for Thomsen disease change one of the two protein subunits that make up the ClC-1 channel. The altered protein takes on new, but harmful, properties that disrupt the ability of both subunits to regulate chloride ion flow. Reduced movement of chloride ions into skeletal muscle cells leads to myotonia, which underlies the stiffness and other muscle problems in people with myotonia congenita.Because several CLCN1 mutations can cause either Becker disease or Thomsen disease, doctors usually rely on characteristic signs and symptoms to distinguish the two forms of myotonia congenita. "
252,CLCN2 ,chloride voltage-gated channel 2,"The CLCN2 gene belongs to the CLC family of genes, which provide instructions for making chloride channels. These channels, which transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions), play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. Some chloride channels regulate the flow of chloride ions across cell membranes, while others transport chloride ions within cells.The CLCN2 gene provides instructions for making a chloride channel called ClC-2. These channels are embedded within the outer membrane of most cells, and they transport chloride ions in and out of cells. The channel's function is thought to be particularly important in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. The ClC-2 channel regulates the size (volume) of neurons by playing a role in the intake and release of water as well as maintaining a normal balance of ions in cells.","CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy At least 18 mutations in the CLCN2 gene have been found to cause CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy. This condition is characterized primarily by problems with coordination and balance (ataxia) but can also cause learning disabilities, frequent headaches, and vision problems.Some CLCN2 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ClC-2 channel, impairing the stability of the channel and reducing channel function. Other CLCN2 gene mutations result in a complete loss of channel function, typically by leading to the production of an abnormally short channel protein. A shortened protein is either trapped inside the cell and cannot get to the cell membrane or is quickly broken down.As a result of this reduction in ClC-2 channel activity, certain brain cells and the myelin that surrounds neurons become filled with too much water and cannot function properly. Fluid-filled myelin cannot transmit nerve impulses effectively, resulting in neurological problems such as ataxia and the other signs and symptoms of CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy. "
253,CLCN5 ,chloride voltage-gated channel 5,"The CLCN5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ClC-5 that transports charged atoms (ions) across cell membranes. Specifically, ClC-5 exchanges negatively charged atoms of chlorine (chloride ions) for positively charged atoms of hydrogen (protons or hydrogen ions). Based on this function, ClC-5 is known as a H+/Cl- exchanger.ClC-5 is found primarily in the kidneys, particularly in structures called proximal tubules. These structures help to reabsorb nutrients, water, and other materials that have been filtered from the bloodstream. The kidneys reabsorb needed materials into the blood and excrete everything else into the urine.Within proximal tubule cells, ClC-5 is embedded in specialized compartments called endosomes. Endosomes are formed at the cell surface to carry proteins and other molecules to their destinations within the cell. ClC-5 transports hydrogen ions into endosomes and chloride ions out, which helps these compartments maintain the proper acidity level (pH). Endosomal pH levels must be tightly regulated for proximal tubule cells to function properly.","Dent disease About 150 mutations in the CLCN5 gene have been found to cause Dent disease 1, a chronic kidney disorder that can cause kidney failure. Most of the mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of ClC-5 or prevent cells from producing any of this protein. A loss of ClC-5 alters the regulation of endosomal pH, which disrupts the overall function of proximal tubule cells and prevents them from reabsorbing proteins and other materials into the bloodstream. As a result, proteins are lost through the urine (tubular proteinuria). A failure to reabsorb calcium and other nutrients into the bloodstream can cause bone defects, kidney stones, and related health problems in people with Dent disease 1. Abnormal proximal tubule function ultimately leads to kidney failure in most affected individuals. "
254,CLCN7 ,chloride voltage-gated channel 7,"The CLCN7 gene belongs to the CLC family of genes, which provide instructions for making chloride channels. These channels, which transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions), play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. Some CLC channels regulate the flow of chloride ions across cell membranes, while others transport chloride ions within cells.The CLCN7 gene provides instructions for making a chloride channel called ClC-7. These channels are abundant in cells throughout the body. They are particularly important for the normal function of osteoclasts, which are specialized cells that break down bone tissue. Osteoclasts are involved in bone remodeling, a normal process in which old bone is removed and new bone is created to replace it. Bones are constantly being remodeled, and the process is carefully controlled to ensure that bones stay strong and healthy.ClC-7 channels help regulate the relative acidity (pH) of osteoclasts. These channels transport two negatively charged chloride ions out of these cells for every positively charged hydrogen atom (hydrogen ion) that flows in. In this way, ClC-7 channels help balance the acidic environment that osteoclasts use to dissolve bone tissue. The pH inside and outside osteoclasts must be carefully controlled for these cells to break down bone effectively.","Osteopetrosis More than 50 mutations in the CLCN7 gene have been identified in people with osteopetrosis. Mutations in this gene can cause several different forms of the disorder: autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO), which is the most severe form; autosomal dominant osteopetrosis (ADO), which tends to be milder; and a moderate form known as intermediate autosomal osteopetrosis (IAO).Mutations in the CLCN7 gene impair the function of ClC-7 channels. The defective channels cannot transport chloride ions effectively, which disrupts the regulation of pH in osteoclasts. As a result, osteoclasts are unable to break down bone normally. When old bone is not broken down as new bone is formed, bones throughout the skeleton become unusually dense. The bones are also structurally abnormal, making them prone to fracture. These problems with bone remodeling underlie all of the major forms of osteopetrosis. "
255,CLCNKA ,chloride voltage-gated channel Ka,"The CLCNKA gene belongs to the CLC family of genes, which provide instructions for making chloride channels. These channels, which transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions), play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. Some CLC channels regulate the flow of chloride ions across cell membranes, while others transport chloride ions within cells.The CLCNKA gene provides instructions for making a chloride channel called ClC-Ka. These channels are found predominantly in the kidneys. ClC-Ka is one of several proteins that work together to regulate the movement of ions into and out of kidney cells. The transport of chloride ions by ClC-Ka channels is part of the mechanism by which the kidneys reabsorb salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) from the urine back into the bloodstream. The retention of salt affects the body's fluid levels and helps maintain blood pressure.ClC-Ka channels are also located in the inner ear, where they play a role in normal hearing.","Bartter syndrome Several people with Bartter syndrome have had mutations in both the CLCNKA gene and a closely related gene called CLCNKB. The CLCNKB gene provides instructions for making a very similar chloride channel, ClC-Kb, that is also found in the kidneys and inner ear. A combination of CLCNKA and CLCNKB gene mutations causes a life-threatening form of the disorder called Bartter syndrome type IV. This condition is also known as antenatal Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness because affected individuals have hearing loss caused by abnormalities in the inner ear.Mutations in the CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes prevent the ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb channels from transporting chloride ions in the kidneys. As a result, the kidneys cannot reabsorb salt normally and excess salt is lost through the urine (salt wasting). The abnormal salt loss disrupts the normal balance of ions in the body. This imbalance underlies many of the major features of Bartter syndrome, including a failure to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive), dehydration, constipation, and increased urine production (polyuria). A loss of ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb function in the inner ear is responsible for the hearing loss characteristic of Bartter syndrome type IV. "
256,CLCNKB ,chloride voltage-gated channel Kb,"The CLCNKB gene belongs to the CLC family of genes, which provide instructions for making chloride channels. These channels, which transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions), play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. Some CLC channels regulate the flow of chloride ions across cell membranes, while others transport chloride ions within cells.The CLCNKB gene provides instructions for making a chloride channel called ClC-Kb. These channels are found predominantly in the kidneys. ClC-Kb is one of several proteins that work together to regulate the movement of ions into and out of kidney cells. The transport of chloride ions by ClC-Kb channels is part of the mechanism by which the kidneys reabsorb salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) from the urine back into the bloodstream. The retention of salt affects the body's fluid levels and helps maintain blood pressure.ClC-Kb channels are also located in the inner ear, where they play a role in normal hearing.","Bartter syndrome More than 30 mutations in the CLCNKB gene have been identified in people with Bartter syndrome type III. This form of the condition, which is also described as classical Bartter syndrome, begins in childhood and tends to be less severe than other types of Bartter syndrome.Many of the mutations responsible for Bartter syndrome type III delete the entire CLCNKB gene. Other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ClC-Kb channel or lead to an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of ClC-Kb. A loss of functional ClC-Kb channels impairs the transport of chloride ions in the kidneys. As a result, the kidneys cannot reabsorb salt normally and excess salt is lost through the urine (salt wasting). The abnormal salt loss disrupts the normal balance of ions in the body. This imbalance underlies many of the major features of Bartter syndrome type III.Several people with a more severe form of Bartter syndrome have had mutations in both the CLCNKB gene and a closely related gene called CLCNKA. The CLCNKA gene provides instructions for making a very similar chloride channel, ClC-Ka, that is also found in the kidneys and inner ear. A combination of CLCNKA and CLCNKB gene mutations causes a life-threatening form of the disorder known as Bartter syndrome type IV or antenatal Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness. In addition to salt wasting, this form of the disorder is characterized by hearing loss that results from a loss of ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb function in the inner ear. "
257,CLIP2 ,CAP-Gly domain containing linker protein 2,"The CLIP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called CAP-Gly domain containing linker protein 2. The protein is also known as CLIP-115. This protein is found predominantly in the brain, where it likely plays a role in the normal structure and function of nerve cells. Within cells, this protein is thought to regulate aspects of the cytoskeleton, the structural framework that helps to determine cell shape, size, and movement. The protein is associated with microtubules, which are rigid, hollow fibers that make up a significant part of the cytoskeleton. Microtubules help cells maintain their shape, assist in the process of cell division, and are essential for the transport of materials within cells.","Williams syndrome The CLIP2 gene is located in a region of chromosome 7 that is deleted in people with Williams syndrome. As a result of this deletion, people with this condition are missing one copy of the CLIP2 gene in each cell. Studies suggest that the loss of this gene may contribute to some of the characteristic features of Williams syndrome, including the unique behavioral traits and other symptoms involving the nervous system. A deletion of this gene probably disrupts the normal regulation of the cytoskeleton and affects the structure of nerve cells in the brain. It is not known how these changes may be related to the characteristic signs and symptoms of Williams syndrome. "
258,CLN3 ,"CLN3, battenin","The CLN3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in tissues throughout the body, yet its function is unclear. The CLN3 protein is found in many compartments within cells, but its role in lysosomes is most well-studied. Lysosomes are cellular compartments that digest and recycle different types of molecules. The CLN3 protein spans the membrane surrounding lysosomes, helping to facilitate communication between it and the rest of the cell.Studies have associated the CLN3 protein with many cellular processes, including recycling of worn-out cell parts and unneeded proteins (autophagy), maintenance of the relative acidity (pH) of lysosomes, the movement of molecules from the cell surface into the cell (endocytosis), transportation (trafficking) of proteins to where they are needed in the cell, self-destruction of cells (apoptosis), cell growth and division (proliferation), and maintenance of the body's water balance (osmoregulation). It is uncertain which of these varied functions is the primary role of the CLN3 protein, or if these processes instead represent downstream effects.","CLN3 disease More than 65 mutations in the CLN3 gene have been found to cause CLN3 disease. CLN3 disease is an inherited disorder that begins in childhood and primarily affects the nervous system. People with this condition develop worsening vision impairment, intellectual disability, movement problems, speech difficulties, and seizures.One CLN3 gene mutation, found in more than 90 percent of cases, deletes about 1,000 DNA building blocks (base pairs) in the gene. This mutation, which is usually called the 1 kilobase (kb) deletion, often occurs in both copies of the CLN3 gene. The 1 kb deletion removes a piece of the CLN3 gene and leads to the production of an abnormally short protein. As a result, the amount of normal CLN3 protein is severely reduced. Other mutations reduce the amount of normal protein or impair its function. It is not known how loss of this protein causes the signs and symptoms of CLN3 disease.CLN3 disease is characterized by the accumulation of proteins and other substances in lysosomes. These accumulations occur in cells throughout the body; however, nerve cells seem to be particularly vulnerable to their effects. The accumulations can cause cell damage leading to cell death. The progressive death of nerve cells in the brain and other tissues leads to the neurological signs and symptoms of CLN3 disease. However, it is unclear how mutations in the CLN3 gene are involved in the buildup of substances in lysosomes. "
259,CLN5 ,"CLN5, intracellular trafficking protein","The CLN5 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not well understood. Cells produce a CLN5 protein that is inactive and contains extra protein segments. This inactive protein is called a preprotein. For the CLN5 preprotein to become active, the additional segments must be removed, followed by additional processing steps. The active CLN5 protein is then transported to cell compartments called lysosomes, which digest and recycle different types of molecules. Research suggests that the CLN5 protein may play a role in the process by which lysosomes break down or recycle damaged or unneeded proteins within cells.","CLN5 disease At least 35 mutations in the CLN5 gene have been found to cause CLN5 disease. This condition impairs mental and motor development causing difficulty with walking and intellectual function. In addition, affected children often develop recurrent seizures (epilepsy) and vision loss. Signs and symptoms of CLN5 disease typically appear around age 5 but can begin in adolescence or adulthood.Most of the mutations that cause CLN5 disease make changes in the CLN5 protein that interfere with the processing of the preprotein or alter the structure of the protein. The resulting proteins cannot be transported to the lysosomes. Other mutations lead to production of abnormal proteins that are quickly broken down. One such mutation, known as Finmajor, is responsible for almost all cases of CLN5 disease in people of Finnish descent. The Finmajor mutation replaces the protein building block (amino acid) tyrosine with a signal to stop protein production prematurely (written as Tyr392Ter or Y392X).A lack of functional CLN5 protein within lysosomes probably impairs the breakdown of certain proteins, which then likely accumulate in cells throughout the body. While these accumulations can damage any cells, nerve cells appear to be particularly vulnerable. Widespread loss of nerve cells in CLN5 disease leads to severe signs and symptoms and early death.In the cases in which CLN5 disease develops in adolescence or adulthood, it is thought that the CLN5 gene mutations lead to a CLN5 protein with reduced function that is broken down earlier than normal. Because the altered CLN5 protein can function for a small amount of time, some damaged or unneeded proteins may be broken down in lysosomes. Since it takes longer for these substances to accumulate and cause nerve cell death, the signs and symptoms of CLN5 disease in these individuals occur later in life. "
260,CLN6 ,"CLN6, transmembrane ER protein","The CLN6 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not well understood. Within cells, the CLN6 protein is found in a structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein processing and transport. Research suggests that the CLN6 protein regulates the transportation of certain proteins and fats from the endoplasmic reticulum to lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments in the cell that digest and recycle materials. Based on this function, the CLN6 protein appears to help cells get rid of materials they no longer need.","CLN6 disease More than 70 mutations in the CLN6 gene have been found to cause CLN6 disease. This condition impairs motor and mental development, typically starting in early to late childhood, causing gradually worsening problems with movement and a decline in intellectual function. In some cases, signs and symptoms of CLN6 disease do not appear until adulthood.Most CLN6 gene mutations result in the production of an abnormal CLN6 protein that is quickly broken down (degraded). As a result, there is a severe reduction in the amount of functional CLN6 protein in cells. While it is not known how the loss of this protein causes the signs and symptoms of CLN6 disease, it is likely that the protein's quick degradation contributes to the childhood onset of CLN6 disease.In the cases in which CLN6 disease develops in adulthood, CLN6 gene mutations often change single protein building blocks (amino acids), resulting in a CLN6 protein with reduced function. Research suggests that these CLN6 gene mutations allow enough functional protein to be produced so that signs and symptoms of the disorder do not develop until later in life.CLN6 disease is characterized by the accumulation of proteins or peptides and other substances in lysosomes. These accumulations occur in cells throughout the body; however, nerve cells seem to be particularly vulnerable to their effects. The accumulations can cause cell damage leading to cell death. The progressive death of nerve cells in the brain and other tissues leads to the signs and symptoms of CLN6 disease. However, it is unclear how mutations in the CLN6 gene are involved in the buildup of substances in lysosomes in CLN6 disease. These accumulations occur in more cells throughout the body in children with CLN6 disease than in affected adults. "
261,CLN8 ,"CLN8, transmembrane ER and ERGIC protein","The CLN8 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose precise function is not known but that is thought to play a transport role within cells. Specifically, the CLN8 protein likely helps to move materials in and out of a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein production, processing, and transport. The CLN8 protein may also play a role in helping the endoplasmic reticulum regulate levels of fats (lipids) in cells. In certain cells, including nerve cells, the CLN8 protein is thought to be active outside of the endoplasmic reticulum, but its function is unknown.","CLN8 disease At least 25 mutations in the CLN8 gene have been found to cause CLN8 disease. CLN8 disease is an inherited disorder that varies in severity and primarily affects the nervous system. The less-severe form of CLN8 disease is characterized by recurrent seizures (epilepsy) and a decline in intellectual function that begins between ages 5 and 10. Individuals with the less-severe form of CLN8 disease often live into late adulthood. People with the more-severe form of CLN8 disease experience a gradual worsening of motor and cognitive skills, epilepsy, and vision loss. In this form, signs and symptoms typically appear between ages 2 and 7. Individuals with the more-severe form of CLN8 disease usually survive only into late childhood or adolescence.A specific mutation that replaces the protein building block (amino acid) arginine with the amino acid glycine at position 26 in the CLN8 protein (written as Arg26Gly or R26G) is found in all individuals from a northern region of Finland who have the less-severe form of CLN8 disease. This mutation probably leads to production of a protein with reduced function. Because there is likely still some normal function of the CLN8 protein, features of this form are less severe compared to other cases of CLN8 disease. Affected individuals have a reduction in the levels of certain lipids in the brain, likely due to a decrease in CLN8 protein activity, but the effects of this reduction are unclear. Individuals with this form of CLN8 disease have mild brain abnormalities resulting from nerve cell death in the brain, but the cause of this cell death is unknown.Some CLN8 gene mutations that cause the more-severe form of CLN8 disease likely drastically reduce the function of the CLN8 protein. Other mutations likely impair transport of the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum, so that it cannot perform its function. It is unclear how a loss or reduction of CLN8 protein leads to the signs and symptoms of CLN8 disease. In the more-severe form of CLN8 disease, proteins and other substances accumulate in cell structures called lysosomes. While accumulations of these substances occur in cells throughout the body, nerve cells appear to be particularly vulnerable to damage caused by the abnormal cell materials; however, it is unclear how mutations in the CLN8 gene are involved in this buildup. Widespread loss of nerve cells in CLN8 disease leads to the neurological signs and symptoms and, in the case of the more-severe form, early death. "
262,CLPB ,"ClpB homolog, mitochondrial AAA ATPase chaperonin","The CLPB gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. The CLPB protein is found in cells throughout the body but is most abundant in the brain. Based on its similarity to a protein in other organisms, researchers speculate that the CLPB protein helps unfold misfolded proteins so they can be refolded correctly. When misfolded, proteins cannot function properly and may be damaging to cells.","CLPB deficiency At least 20 CLPB gene mutations have been found to cause CLPB deficiency. This condition is characterized by neurological problems, including movement abnormalities and seizures; a shortage of white blood cells (neutropenia), which can increase the risk of infections; and clouding of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts). In addition, affected individuals have an increased amount of a molecule called 3-methylglutaconic acid in their urine, which does not appear to cause health problems. The severity of these features varies widely. Many of the CLPB gene mutations lead to an abnormally short CLPB protein that is likely broken down quickly. Other mutations may reduce CLPB's function. The severity of the condition is thought to be related to the amount of functional protein remaining: severe CLPB deficiency is likely caused by a complete absence of CLPB protein, while moderate and mild CLPB deficiency result when some functional CLPB protein is produced. Researchers are unsure how reduction or absence of this protein leads to the signs and symptoms of CLPB deficiency. "
263,CLPP ,caseinolytic mitochondrial matrix peptidase proteolytic subunit,"The CLPP gene provides instructions for making the ClpP subunit protein. Multiple copies of this protein interact with each other to form a barrel-shaped chamber known as the ClpP complex. This complex is one of two parts of the ClpXP protease, which breaks down abnormally folded proteins. The other part of the ClpXP protease, called the ClpX complex, unfolds the abnormal proteins and feeds them into the chamber formed by the ClpP complex, where they are broken down into small fragments.The ClpP complex is found in structures in the cell called mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers of cells.","Perrault syndrome At least three mutations in the CLPP gene have been found in families with Perrault syndrome, a condition characterized by hearing loss in affected males and females and abnormalities of the ovaries in affected females. The CLPP gene mutations involved in Perrault syndrome likely alter the structure of the barrel-shaped chamber formed by the ClpP complex. These changes may impair the breakdown of misfolded mitochondrial proteins, which could impact mitochondrial function; however, it is unclear how these changes lead to the features of Perrault syndrome. "
264,CLRN1 ,clarin 1,"The CLRN1 gene provides information for making a protein called clarin 1. This protein is probably involved in normal hearing and vision. Clarin 1 has been found in several areas of the body, including sensory cells in the inner ear called hair cells. These cells help transmit sound and motion signals to the brain. This protein is also active in the retina, which is the light-sensing tissue that lines the back of the eye. Although the function of clarin 1 has not been determined, studies suggest that it plays a role in communication between nerve cells (neurons) in the inner ear and in the retina. Clarin 1 may be important for the development and function of synapses, which are junctions between neurons where cell-to-cell communication occurs.","Usher syndrome At least 15 mutations in the CLRN1 gene have been identified in people with Usher syndrome type III, which is characterized by a combination of hearing loss and vision loss. Some affected individuals also have problems with balance and coordination. CLRN1 gene mutations cause a form of the condition known as Usher syndrome type IIIA (USH3A). This form of Usher syndrome is rare in most countries, although it represents about 40 percent of all Usher syndrome cases in the Finnish population.Several CLRN1 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the clarin 1 protein. In some cases, these mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the protein or prevent the production of any functional clarin 1. Other mutations insert or delete small amounts of DNA in the CLRN1 gene, which probably impairs the normal function of the protein. It is unclear how a missing or altered clarin 1 protein leads to the signs and symptoms of Usher syndrome type IIIA.Two particular CLRN1 gene mutations are most common in families of Finnish ancestry. One mutation, sometimes called Finmajor and written as Tyr176Ter or Y176X, leads to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of clarin 1. The other mutation, written as Met120Lys or M120K and also known as Finminor, substitutes the amino acid lysine for the amino acid methionine at protein position 120. This mutation appears to disrupt the protein's normal function. "
265,CNBP ,CCHC-type zinc finger nucleic acid binding protein,"The CNBP gene (also known as ZNF9) provides instructions for making a protein called CCHC-type zinc finger nucleic acid binding protein. This protein has seven regions, called zinc finger domains, which are thought to attach (bind) to specific sites on DNA and its chemical cousin, RNA.The CNBP protein is found in many of the body's tissues, but it is most abundant in the heart and in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). Although the exact function of this protein is unclear, it appears to regulate the activity of other genes. The CNBP protein is necessary for normal embryonic development.One region of the CNBP gene contains a segment of four DNA building blocks (nucleotides) that is repeated multiple times. This sequence, which is written as CCTG, is called a tetranucleotide repeat. In most people, the CCTG sequence is repeated fewer than 26 times.","Myotonic dystrophy Type 2 myotonic dystrophy results from a mutation in the CNBP gene known as a tetranucleotide repeat expansion. This mutation increases the size of the repeated CCTG segment in the CNBP gene. People with type 2 myotonic dystrophy have from 75 to more than 11,000 CCTG repeats.The mutated CNBP gene produces an altered version of messenger RNA, which is a molecular blueprint of the gene that is normally used to guide the production of proteins. Researchers have found that the altered messenger RNA traps proteins to form clumps within the cell. The clumps interfere with the production of many other proteins. These changes prevent muscle cells and cells in other tissues from functioning properly, leading to muscle weakness and the other features of type 2 myotonic dystrophy. "
266,CNGA3 ,cyclic nucleotide gated channel alpha 3,"The CNGA3 gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha subunit) of the cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel. These channels are found exclusively in light-detecting (photoreceptor) cells called cones, which are located in a specialized tissue at the back of the eye known as the retina. Cones provide vision in bright light (daylight vision), including color vision. Other photoreceptor cells, called rods, provide vision in low light (night vision).CNG channels are openings in the cell membrane that transport positively charged atoms (cations) into cells. In cones, CNG channels remain open under dark conditions, allowing cations to flow in. When light enters the eye, it triggers the closure of these channels, stopping the inward flow of cations. This change in cation transport alters the cone's electrical charge, which ultimately generates a signal that is interpreted by the brain as vision. This process of translating light into an electrical signal is called phototransduction.","Achromatopsia More than 100 mutations in the CNGA3 gene have been found to cause the vision disorder achromatopsia. These mutations underlie about 25 percent of cases of complete achromatopsia, a form of the disorder characterized by a total lack of color vision and other vision problems that are present from early infancy. CNGA3 gene mutations have also been identified in a few individuals with incomplete achromatopsia, a milder form of the disorder associated with limited color vision.The CNGA3 gene mutations that underlie complete achromatopsia affect the production or function of the alpha subunit. In some cases, no protein is produced. In others, the protein is altered and does not function normally. CNG channels assembled without the alpha subunit or with an abnormal subunit are nonfunctional; they prevent cones from carrying out phototransduction. Researchers speculate that some defective channels allow a huge influx of cations into cones, which ultimately causes these cells to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). A loss of cone function underlies the lack of color vision and other vision problems in people with complete achromatopsia.A few mutations in the CNGA3 gene reduce but do not eliminate the function of CNG channels in cones. These mutations cause incomplete achromatopsia because the partially functioning cones can transmit some visual information to the brain.Because these CNG channels are specific to cones, rods are generally unaffected by this disorder. "
267,CNGB3 ,cyclic nucleotide gated channel beta 3,"The CNGB3 gene provides instructions for making one part (the beta subunit) of the cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel. These channels are found exclusively in light-detecting (photoreceptor) cells called cones, which are located in a specialized tissue at the back of the eye known as the retina. Cones provide vision in bright light (daylight vision), including color vision. Other photoreceptor cells, called rods, provide vision in low light (night vision).CNG channels are openings in the cell membrane that transport positively charged atoms (cations) into cells. In cones, CNG channels remain open under dark conditions, allowing cations to flow in. When light enters the eye, it triggers the closure of these channels, stopping the inward flow of cations. This change in cation transport alters the cone's electrical charge, which ultimately generates a signal that is interpreted by the brain as vision. This process of translating light into an electrical signal is called phototransduction.","Achromatopsia More than 40 mutations in the CNGB3 gene have been found to cause the vision disorder achromatopsia. These mutations cause 50 to 70 percent of cases of complete achromatopsia, a form of the disorder characterized by a total lack of color vision and other vision problems that are present from early infancy. Worldwide, the most common mutation that causes this condition deletes a single DNA building block (base pair) from the CNGB3 gene. This mutation can be written as 1148delC.Complete achromatopsia occurs frequently in Pingelapese islanders, who live on one of the Eastern Caroline Islands of Micronesia. Among the Pingelapese, this condition results from a mutation that changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the beta subunit. This mutation replaces the amino acid serine with the amino acid phenylalanine at position 435 in the protein (written as Ser435Phe or S435F).Most CNGB3 gene mutations prevent the production of any functional beta subunit, which alters the structure of CNG channels. The resulting channels are nonfunctional and prevent cones from carrying out phototransduction. Researchers speculate that the defective channels allow a huge influx of cations into cones, which ultimately causes these cells to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). A loss of cone function underlies the lack of color vision and other vision problems in people with complete achromatopsia.Because these CNG channels are specific to cones, rods are generally unaffected by this disorder. "
268,COG5 ,component of oligomeric golgi complex 5,"The COG5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called component of oligomeric Golgi complex 5 (COG5). As its name suggests, COG5 is one piece of a group of proteins known as the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex. This complex functions in the Golgi apparatus, which is a cell structure in which newly produced proteins are modified. One process that occurs in the Golgi apparatus is glycosylation, by which sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) are attached to proteins and fats. Glycosylation modifies proteins so they can perform a wider variety of functions.The COG complex takes part in the transport of proteins, including the enzymes that perform glycosylation, within the Golgi apparatus. COG is specifically involved in retrograde transport, which moves proteins backward through the Golgi apparatus. Retrograde transport is important for recycling Golgi proteins and ensuring that they are in the correct location in the structure, which is key to proper glycosylation. The proteins are transported in sac-like structures called vesicles that attach to the Golgi membrane and release the contents into the Golgi apparatus. The COG complex controls the attachment (tethering) of the vesicles to the Golgi membrane.","COG5-congenital disorder of glycosylation At least eight mutations in the COG5 gene are known to cause COG5-congenital disorder of glycosylation (COG5-CDG). This condition often leads to developmental delay and intellectual disability and causes other abnormalities. Mutations in the COG5 gene reduce the amount of COG5 protein or eliminate it completely, which disrupts retrograde transport in the Golgi apparatus. This disruption results in abnormal protein glycosylation, which can affect multiple body systems, leading to the signs and symptoms of COG5-CDG. The severity of the condition is related to the amount of COG5 protein that remains in cells. "
269,COL1A1 ,collagen type I alpha 1 chain,"The COL1A1 gene provides instructions for making part of a large molecule called type I collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support many tissues in the body, including cartilage, bone, tendon, skin, and the white part of the eye (the sclera). Type I collagen is the most abundant form of collagen in the human body.A component of type I collagen called the pro-α1(I) chain is produced from the COL1A1 gene. Collagens begin as rope-like procollagen molecules that are each made up of three chains. Type I collagen is composed of two pro-α1(I) chains and one pro-α2(I) chain (which is produced from the COL1A2 gene).The triple-stranded procollagen molecules are processed by enzymes in a series of steps inside and outside the cell to create mature collagen. The collagen molecules then arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils that form stable interactions (cross-links) with one another in the spaces between cells. The cross-links result in the formation of very strong type I collagen fibers.","Caffey disease A particular mutation in the COL1A1 gene causes infantile cortical hyperostosis, commonly known as Caffey disease. The signs and symptoms of Caffey disease are usually apparent by the time an infant is 5 months old. This condition is characterized by swelling of soft tissues (muscles, for example), pain, and excessive new bone formation (hyperostosis). The bone abnormalities mainly affect the jawbone, collarbones (clavicles), and the shafts (diaphyses) of long bones in the arms and legs. For unknown reasons, the pain and swelling associated with Caffey disease typically go away within a few months. Through a normal process called bone remodeling, which replaces old bone tissue with new bone, the excess bone is usually reabsorbed by the body and undetectable on x-ray images by the age of 2.The mutation that causes this condition occurs in one copy of the COL1A1 gene in each cell. It alters a single protein building block (amino acid), replacing the amino acid arginine with the amino acid cysteine at protein position 836 (written as Arg836Cys or R836C). This mutation results in the production of type I collagen fibrils that are variable in size and shape, but it is unknown how these changes lead to the signs and symptoms of Caffey disease. "
270,COL1A2 ,collagen type I alpha 2 chain,"The COL1A2 gene provides instructions for making part of a large molecule called type I collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support many tissues in the body, including cartilage, bone, tendon, skin, and the white part of the eye (the sclera). Type I collagen is the most abundant form of collagen in the human body.A component of type I collagen called the pro-α2(I) chain is produced from the COL1A2 gene. Collagens begin as rope-like procollagen molecules that are each made up of three chains. Type I collagen is composed of two pro-α1(I) chains (which are produced from the COL1A1 gene) and one pro-α2(I) chain.The triple-stranded procollagen molecules are processed by enzymes in a series of steps inside and outside the cell to create mature collagen. The collagen molecules then arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils that form stable interactions (cross-links) with one another in the spaces between cells. The cross-links result in the formation of very strong type I collagen fibers.","Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Several mutations in the COL1A2 gene can cause a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome known as the arthrochalasia type. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect the connective tissues that support the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues. The arthrochalasia type is characterized by an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility) and dislocations of both hips at birth. The genetic changes, which affect one copy of the COL1A2 gene in each cell, lead to the production of a pro-α2(I) chain that is missing a critical segment. The absence of this segment interferes with the assembly and processing of pro-α2(I) chains into mature type I collagen molecules. These changes mainly affect tissues that are rich in type I collagen, such as the skin, bones, and tendons.Rarely, mutations in both copies of the COL1A2 gene in each cell have been reported in people with a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome described as the cardiac-valvular type. This rare condition is characterized by abnormalities of the valves in the heart, highly stretchy (elastic) skin, and joint hypermobility. The mutations that cause this form of the disorder prevent cells from producing any normal pro-α2(I) chains. As a result, type I collagen fibrils in the skin and other tissues cannot be assembled correctly. The abnormal collagen weakens connective tissues, which causes the signs and symptoms of this condition. "
271,COL2A1 ,collagen type II alpha 1 chain,"The COL2A1 gene provides instructions for making one component of type II collagen, called the pro-alpha1(II) chain. Type II collagen adds structure and strength to the connective tissues that support the body's muscles, joints, organs, and skin. Type II collagen is found primarily in cartilage, a tough but flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears. Type II collagen is also part of the clear gel that fills the eyeball (the vitreous), the inner ear, and the center portion of the discs between the vertebrae in the spine (nucleus pulposus).To construct type II collagen, three pro-alpha1(II) chains twist together to form a triple-stranded, rope-like procollagen molecule. Procollagen molecules are then processed by enzymes in the cell. Once processed, the molecules leave the cell and arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils that link to one another (cross-link) in the spaces around cells. The cross-linkages result in the formation of very strong, mature type II collagen fibers.","Achondrogenesis At least 18 mutations in the COL2A1 gene have been found to cause a form of achondrogenesis known as type 2 or the Langer-Saldino type. This rare disorder of bone development is characterized by short arms and legs, a narrow chest with short ribs, underdeveloped lungs, and a lack of normal bone formation (ossification) in the spine and pelvis. Serious health problems result from these abnormalities, and infants with achondrogenesis usually die before or soon after birth.The mutations that cause achondrogenesis type 2 change one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make the pro-alpha1(II) chain. Specifically, the amino acid glycine is replaced with a different amino acid at one of various positions in this collagen chain. All of these mutations prevent the normal production of mature type II collagen, which results in the severe skeletal abnormalities seen in this disorder. "
272,COL3A1 ,collagen type III alpha 1 chain,"The COL3A1 gene provides instructions for making type III collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support many tissues in the body. Type III collagen is found in the skin, lungs, intestinal walls, and the walls of blood vessels.The components of type III collagen, called pro-α1(III) chains, are produced from the COL3A1 gene. Each molecule of type III procollagen is made up of three copies of this chain.The triple-stranded, rope-like procollagen molecules are processed by enzymes outside the cell to create mature type III collagen. The collagen molecules then arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils that form stable interactions (cross-links) with one another and with other types of collagen in the spaces between cells. The cross-links result in the formation of very strong collagen fibers.","Ehlers-Danlos syndrome More than 500 mutations in the COL3A1 gene have been found to cause a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome called the vascular type. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect the connective tissues that support the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues. The vascular type can cause potentially life-threatening complications, including tearing (rupture) of blood vessels, intestines, and other organs. The mutations that cause this form of the disorder alter the structure and production of type III procollagen molecules. As a result, a large percentage of type III collagen molecules are assembled incorrectly, or the amount of type III collagen is greatly reduced. Researchers believe that these changes affect tissues that are normally rich in this type of collagen, such as the skin, blood vessel walls, and internal organs. An insufficient amount of type III collagen weakens connective tissues in these parts of the body, causing the signs and symptoms of the vascular type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. "
273,COL4A1 ,collagen type IV alpha 1 chain,"The COL4A1 gene provides instructions for making one component of type IV collagen, which is a flexible protein important in the structure of many tissues throughout the body. Specifically, this gene makes the alpha1(IV) chain of type IV collagen. This chain combines with another alpha1 chain and a different type of alpha (IV) chain called alpha2 to make a complete type IV collagen alpha1-1-2 molecule. Type IV collagen molecules attach to each other to form complex protein networks. These protein networks are the main component of basement membranes, which are thin sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues. Type IV collagen alpha1-1-2 networks play an important role in the basement membranes in virtually all tissues throughout the body, particularly the basement membranes surrounding the body's blood vessels (vasculature). The type IV collagen network helps the basement membranes interact with nearby cells, playing a role in cell movement (migration), cell growth and division (proliferation), cell maturation (differentiation), and the survival of cells.","COL4A1-related brain small-vessel disease Mutations in the COL4A1 gene have been found to cause COL4A1-related brain small-vessel disease. This condition is part of a group of conditions called COL4A1-related disorders that have overlapping signs and symptoms involving fragile blood vessels. COL4A1-related brain small-vessel disease is characterized by stroke and eye abnormalities. Most of the identified COL4A1 gene mutations that cause COL4A1-related brain small-vessel disease change one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make the alpha1(IV) chain of type IV collagen. Specifically, the mutations replace the amino acid glycine with a different amino acid at one of various places in this collagen chain. The substitution of another amino acid for glycine in the alpha1(IV) chain prevents this chain from combining with other chains to form a complete type IV collagen molecule. This alteration in type IV collagen prevents protein networks from forming and basement membranes from developing properly, which causes the tissues they support to weaken. Blood vessels throughout the body become fragile, leading to the signs and symptoms of COL4A1-related brain small-vessel disease.It is unclear how mutations in the COL4A1 gene can lead to different disorders. It is likely that mutations in different regions of this gene play a role in the development of the various signs and symptoms of the COL4A1-related disorders. Other genetic changes as well as environmental factors may also contribute to the features of the different COL4A1-related disorders. "
274,COL4A3 ,collagen type IV alpha 3 chain,"The COL4A3 gene provides instructions for making one component of type IV collagen, which is a flexible protein. Specifically, this gene makes the alpha3(IV) chain of type IV collagen. This chain combines with two other types of alpha (IV) chains (the alpha4 and alpha5 chains) to make a complete type IV collagen molecule. Type IV collagen molecules attach to each other to form complex protein networks. These networks make up a large portion of basement membranes, which are thin sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues. Type IV collagen alpha3-4-5 networks play an especially important role in the basement membranes of the kidney, inner ear, and eye.","Alport syndrome More than 40 mutations in the COL4A3 gene have been found to cause Alport syndrome. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in a region where the alpha3(IV) collagen chain combines with other type IV collagen chains. Other mutations in the COL4A3 gene severely decrease or prevent the production of alpha3(IV) chains. As a result, there is a serious deficiency of the type IV collagen alpha3-4-5 network in the basement membranes of the kidney, inner ear, and eye. In the kidney, other types of collagen accumulate in the basement membranes, eventually leading to scarring of the kidneys and kidney failure. Mutations in this gene can also lead to abnormal function in the inner ear, resulting in hearing loss. "
275,COL4A4 ,collagen type IV alpha 4 chain,"The COL4A4 gene provides instructions for making one component of type IV collagen, which is a flexible protein. Specifically, this gene makes the alpha4(IV) chain of type IV collagen. This chain combines with two other types of alpha (IV) chains (the alpha3 and alpha5 chains) to make a complete type IV collagen molecule. Type IV collagen molecules attach to each other to form complex protein networks. These networks make up a large portion of basement membranes, which are thin sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues. Type IV collagen alpha3-4-5 networks play an especially important role in the basement membranes of the kidney, inner ear, and eye.","Alport syndrome More than 20 mutations in the COL4A4 gene have been found to cause Alport syndrome. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in a region where the alpha4(IV) collagen chain combines with other type IV collagen chains. Other mutations in the COL4A4 gene severely decrease or prevent the production of alpha4(IV) chains. As a result, there is a serious deficiency of the type IV collagen alpha3-4-5 network in the basement membranes of the kidney, inner ear, and eye. In the kidney, other types of collagen accumulate in the basement membranes, eventually leading to scarring of the kidneys and kidney failure. Mutations in this gene can also lead to abnormal function in the inner ear, resulting in hearing loss. "
276,COL4A5 ,collagen type IV alpha 5 chain,"The COL4A5 gene provides instructions for making one component of type IV collagen, which is a flexible protein. Specifically, this gene makes the alpha5(IV) chain of type IV collagen. This chain combines with two other types of alpha (IV) chains (the alpha3 and alpha4 chains) to make a complete type IV collagen molecule. Type IV collagen molecules attach to each other to form complex protein networks. These networks make up a large portion of basement membranes, which are thin sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues. Type IV collagen alpha3-4-5 networks play an especially important role in the basement membranes of the kidney, inner ear, and eye.","Alport syndrome More than 400 mutations in the COL4A5 gene have been found to cause Alport syndrome. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in a region where the alpha5(IV) collagen chain combines with other type IV collagen chains. Other mutations in the COL4A5 gene severely decrease or prevent the production of alpha5(IV) chains. As a result, there is a serious deficiency of the type IV collagen alpha3-4-5 network in the basement membranes of the kidney, inner ear, and eye. In the kidney, other types of collagen accumulate in the basement membranes, eventually leading to scarring of the kidneys and kidney failure. Mutations in this gene can also lead to abnormal function in the inner ear, resulting in hearing loss. "
277,COL5A1 ,collagen type V alpha 1 chain,"The COL5A1 gene provides instructions for making a component of type V collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support many tissues in the body, including skin, ligaments, bones, tendons, and muscles.A component of type V collagen called the pro-α1(V) chain is produced from the COL5A1 gene. Collagens begin as rope-like procollagen molecules that are each made up of three chains. Two combinations of chains can produce type V collagen: three pro-α1(V) chains or two pro-α1(V) chains and one pro-α2(V) chain (which is produced from the COL5A2 gene).The triple-stranded procollagen molecules are processed by enzymes outside the cell to create mature collagen. The collagen molecules then arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils with another form of collagen, type I. Type V collagen regulates the width (diameter) of those fibrils. Studies suggest that type V collagen also controls the assembly of other types of collagen into fibrils in several tissues.","Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Mutations in the COL5A1 gene cause a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome called the classical type. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect the connective tissues that support the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues. This form of the disorder is characterized by skin that is soft, highly stretchy (elastic), and fragile; abnormal scarring; and an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility). More than 100 COL5A1 gene mutations have been identified in people with classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The mutations affect one copy of the gene in each cell, reducing the amount of pro-α1(V) chains that cells produce. As a result, fibrils containing type V and type I collagens in the skin and other tissues are disorganized and larger than usual. Researchers believe that the abnormal collagen weakens connective tissues throughout the body, which causes the signs and symptoms of classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. "
278,COL5A2 ,collagen type V alpha 2 chain,"The COL5A2 gene provides instructions for making a component of type V collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support many tissues in the body, including skin, ligaments, bones, tendons, and muscles.A component of type V collagen called the pro-α2(V) chain is produced from the COL5A2 gene. Collagens begin as rope-like procollagen molecules that are each made up of three chains. Two combinations of chains can produce type V collagen: three pro-α1(V) chains (produced from the COL5A1 gene) or two pro-α1(V) chains and one pro-α2(V) chain.The triple-stranded procollagen molecules are processed by enzymes outside the cell to create mature collagen. The collagen molecules then arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils with another form of collagen, type I. Type V collagen regulates the width (diameter) of those fibrils. Studies suggest that type V collagen also controls the assembly of other types of collagen into fibrils in several tissues.","Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Mutations in the COL5A2 gene have been identified in a small number of people with a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome called the classical type.

This form of the disorder is characterized by skin that is soft, highly stretchy (elastic), and fragile; abnormal scarring; and an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility). About 20 COL5A2 gene mutations have been identified in people with classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. These mutations, which affect one copy of the gene in each cell, change the structure of the pro-α2(V) chain. As a result, fibrils containing type V and type I collagens are disorganized and larger than usual.

279,COL6A1 ,collagen type VI alpha 1 chain,"The COL6A1 gene provides instructions for making one component of type VI collagen, which is a flexible protein found in the space that surrounds cells. Specifically, the protein produced from the COL6A1 gene is the alpha(α)1(VI) chain of type VI collagen. This chain combines with chains produced from other genes to produce a complete type VI collagen molecule.Collagens are found in the extracellular matrix, which is an intricate lattice that forms in the space between cells and provides structural support. Type VI collagen is located in the extracellular matrix surrounding cells that make up the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscle cells) and cells that make up connective tissue, which provides strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body, including skin and joints. The extracellular matrix is necessary for cell stability and growth. Research suggests that type VI collagen links basement membranes, which are thin, sheet-like structures that are part of the extracellular matrix, to nearby cells.","Collagen VI-related myopathy Mutations in the COL6A1 gene have been found to cause some cases of collagen VI-related myopathy, which is a group of disorders that vary in severity but generally result in muscle weakness and joint deformities called contractures. These mutations often change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the α1(VI) chain. The most frequently affected amino acid is glycine; changes to this building block disrupt the structure of the α1(VI) chain. Other mutations can also disrupt the structure of the α1(VI) chain.Mutations in the COL6A1 gene affect type VI collagen in different ways. Some mutations lead to altered α1(VI) chains that can be incorporated into the mature type VI collagen molecule, although they disrupt the molecule's structure and function. Other mutations result in an altered chain that cannot be incorporated at all. Still other mutations prevent the production of any functional α1(VI) chain, which impedes formation of type VI collagen. All of these COL6A1 gene mutations lead to a reduction or absence of functional collagen VI molecules. While it is difficult to predict the severity of collagen VI-related myopathy based on the type of mutation, in general, lower amounts of type VI collagen lead to more severe signs and symptoms that begin earlier in life.Changes in α1(VI) chain structure or production lead to an unstable extracellular matrix that is no longer attached to cells through the basement membrane. As a result, the stability of muscle cells and connective tissue progressively declines, which leads to the muscle weakness, contractures, and other signs and symptoms of collagen VI-related myopathy.

"
282,COL7A1 ,collagen type VII alpha 1 chain,"The COL7A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called pro-α1(VII) chain that is used to assemble a larger protein called type VII collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support connective tissues, such as skin, bone, tendons, and ligaments, throughout the body. In particular, type VII collagen plays an essential role in strengthening and stabilizing the skin.Three pro-α1(VII) chains twist together to form a triple-stranded, ropelike molecule known as a procollagen. Cells release (secrete) procollagen molecules, and enzymes cut extra protein segments from the ends. Then the molecules arrange themselves into long, thin bundles of mature type VII collagen.Type VII collagen is the major component of structures in the skin called anchoring fibrils. These fibrils are found in a region known as the epidermal basement membrane zone, which is a two-layer membrane located between the top layer of skin, called the epidermis, and an underlying layer called the dermis. Anchoring fibrils hold the two layers of skin together by connecting the epidermal basement membrane to the dermis.","Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa More than 700 mutations in the COL7A1 gene have been identified in people with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, a condition that causes the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily. These mutations alter the structure or disrupt the production of the pro-α1(VII) chain protein, which affects the production of type VII collagen. When type VII collagen is abnormal or missing, anchoring fibrils cannot form properly. A shortage of these fibrils impairs the connection of the epidermis to the dermis. As a result, friction or other minor trauma can cause the two skin layers to separate. This separation leads to the formation of blisters, which can result in extensive scarring as they heal.Researchers classify dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa into a few major types based on the inheritance pattern and features of the condition. The recessive types of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) result from mutations in both copies of the COL7A1 gene in each cell. The most severe, classic form of this disorder is known as recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa severe generalized (RDEB-sev gen). Most of the COL7A1 gene mutations responsible for RDEB-sev gen result in production of abnormally short pro-α1(VII) chains that cannot form type VII collagen. As a result, little type VII collagen is available to make anchoring fibrils. This lack of anchoring fibrils disrupts the connection between the epidermis and the dermis and causes the extreme skin fragility and other signs and symptoms of RDEB-sev gen.Somewhat less severe forms of RDEB, grouped as the generalized and localized types (RDEB-gen and -loc), are caused by other types of mutations. Many of these genetic changes alter the structure of the pro-α1(VII) chain protein such that it cannot form normal type VII collagen. As a result, anchoring fibrils are reduced in number, or they are altered and cannot function normally. The small amount of normal or partially functional anchoring fibrils accounts for the less severe signs and symptoms of RDEB-gen and -loc.A milder, dominant form of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DDEB) results from mutations in one copy of the COL7A1 gene in each cell. In many cases, these mutations alter a part of type VII collagen known as the triple helical domain. This region gives type VII collagen its usual triple-stranded structure. It is made up of a pattern of protein building blocks (amino acids) in which every third amino acid is a glycine. Mutations that substitute other amino acids for glycine in this region can disrupt the triple-stranded structure of type VII collagen. When the abnormally shaped collagen molecules are incorporated into anchoring fibrils, they interfere with the fibrils' normal function and prevent them from effectively connecting the epidermis and the dermis. Although they are most commonly associated with DDEB, mutations that substitute glycine amino acids in the triple helical domain can also cause RDEB. DDEB can also be caused by other types of mutations, particularly changes that affect the folding of type VII collagen.It is unclear how COL7A1 gene mutations are associated with an increased risk of a certain cancer called squamous cell carcinoma in people with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, particularly RDEB-sev gen. Some research has suggested that abnormal forms of type VII collagen that retain a procollagen fragment called the NC1 domain may increase the risk of tumor formation. Other studies, however, have not found this association. "
283,COL8A2 ,collagen type VIII alpha 2 chain,"The COL8A2 gene provides instructions for making a component of type VIII collagen called alpha 2(VIII) collagen. Type VIII collagen is largely found within the front surface of the eye, called the cornea. Type VIII collagen is a major component of Descemet's membrane, which is a tissue at the back of the cornea. This membrane is a thin, sheet-like structure that separates and supports corneal endothelium cells. These cells regulate the amount of fluid inside the cornea. An appropriate fluid balance in the cornea is necessary for clear vision.To construct type VIII collagen, one subunit of the alpha 2(VIII) collagen protein interacts with two subunits of another protein called alpha 1(VIII) collagen. These three proteins twist together to form a triple-stranded, rope-like molecule known as procollagen. Procollagen molecules are secreted by the cell and processed by enzymes to remove extra protein segments from the ends. Once these molecules are processed, they arrange themselves into long, thin bundles of mature type VIII collagen.","Fuchs endothelial dystrophy At least two mutations in the COL8A2 gene have been found to cause a variant of Fuchs endothelial dystrophy, an eye disorder characterized by progressively blurry vision and sensitivity to bright light. COL8A2 gene mutations are associated with the rare, early-onset variant of Fuchs endothelial dystrophy, in which vision problems typically begin in a person's twenties.The COL8A2 gene mutations that cause the early-onset variant of Fuchs endothelial dystrophy replace single protein building blocks in alpha 2(VIII) collagen. One mutation replaces the amino acid leucine with the amino acid tryptophan at position 450 (written as Leu450Trp or L450W). Another mutation replaces the amino acid glutamine with the amino acid lysine at position 455 (Gln455Lys or Q455K). These mutations impair the structure of alpha 2(VIII) collagen, probably preventing the abnormal protein from being incorporated into type VIII collagen fibers. As a result, there is a reduced amount of type VIII collagen in the cornea, specifically in Descemet's membrane. This abnormal Descemet's membrane leads to the death of the corneal endothelial cells, causing the cornea to become swollen with fluid. Corneal endothelial cells continue to die over time, which causes the vision problems in people with the early-onset variant of Fuchs endothelial dystrophy. "
284,COL9A1 ,collagen type IX alpha 1 chain,"The COL9A1 gene provides instructions for making part of a large molecule called type IX collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support connective tissues, such as skin, bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments. In particular, type IX collagen is an important component of cartilage, which is a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears.Type IX collagen is made up of three proteins that are produced from three distinct genes: one α1(IX) chain, which is produced from the COL9A1 gene, one α2(IX) chain, which is produced from the COL9A2 gene, and one α3(IX) chain, which is produced from the COL9A3 gene. Type IX collagen is more flexible than other types of collagen molecules and is closely associated with type II collagen. Researchers believe that the flexible nature of type IX collagen allows it to act as a bridge that connects type II collagen with other cartilage components. Studies have shown that type IX collagen also interacts with the proteins produced from the MATN3 and COMP genes.","Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia At least one mutation in the COL9A1 gene has been found to cause dominant multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, a disorder of cartilage and bone development that primarily affects the ends of the long bones in the arms and legs (epiphyses). The identified mutation, called a splice-site mutation, involves the addition of one DNA building block (nucleotide) near an area of the gene called exon 8 (written as 1-bp ins, IVS8, T, +3). This mutation disrupts the way the gene's instructions are used to make the α1(IX) chain, resulting in a deletion of several protein building blocks (amino acids). It is not known how this mutation in COL9A1 causes the signs and symptoms of dominant multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. "

All of these mutations disrupt how genetic information is spliced together to make the blueprint for producing the α2(IX) chain. These mutations, called splice-site mutations, change one DNA building block (nucleotide) near an area of the gene called exon 3. These mutations in the COL9A2 gene result in the deletion of 12 protein building blocks (amino acids) from the α2(IX) chain. It is not known how mutations in COL9A2 cause the signs and symptoms of dominant multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. "

It is not known how mutations in COL9A3 cause the signs and symptoms of dominant multiple epiphyseal dysplasia.All identified mutations in type IX collagen delete a portion of the COL3 domain, which suggests that this region has an important function. Mutations may affect the ability of type IX collagen to fold correctly or interact with other cartilage components. "
287,COL11A1 ,collagen type XI alpha 1 chain,"The COL11A1 gene provides instructions for making a component of type XI collagen called the pro-alpha1(XI) chain. Collagens are molecules that provide structure and strength to the connective tissues that support the body's muscles, joints, organs, and skin. Type XI collagen is normally found in cartilage, a tough but flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears. Type XI collagen is also part of the inner ear; the vitreous, which is the clear gel that fills the eyeball; and the nucleus pulposus, which is the center portion of the discs between the bones of the spine (vertebrae).Collagens begin as rope-like procollagen molecules that are each made up of three chains. The pro-alpha1(XI) chain combines with two other collagen chains, pro-alpha2(XI) and pro-alpha1(II), to form a triple-stranded procollagen molecule. Then the ropelike procollagen is processed by enzymes to create mature collagen. Mature collagen molecules arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils that form stable interactions (cross-links) with one another in the spaces between cells (the extracellular matrix). The cross-links result in the formation of very strong type XI collagen fibers.Type XI collagen also helps maintain the spacing and width (diameter) of another type of collagen molecule, type II collagen. Type II collagen is an important component of the vitreous and cartilage. The arrangement and size of type II collagen fibrils is essential for the normal structure of these tissues.","Fibrochondrogenesis At least seven mutations in the COL11A1 gene have been identified in people with fibrochondrogenesis type 1, a disorder of bone growth characterized by severe skeletal abnormalities, hearing loss, and vision loss. Infants with fibrochondrogenesis type 1 have a very narrow chest that prevents the lungs from developing normally. Most children with this condition are stillborn or die shortly after birth from respiratory failure, although some have lived into childhood.Some cases of fibrochondrogenesis type 1 result from a combination of COL11A1 gene mutations. Specifically, one copy of the gene has a mutation that prevents the production of any functional pro-alpha1(XI) chain, and the other copy has a mutation that results in an abnormal version of the pro-alpha1(XI) chain. When the abnormal chain is incorporated into collagen molecules, it creates defective type XI collagen. The abnormal collagen weakens connective tissues, impairing the formation of bones throughout the skeleton and causing changes in the eye and inner ear that lead to vision and hearing problems.In at least two reported cases, fibrochondrogenesis type 1 has been caused by combinations of COL11A1 gene mutations that completely eliminate the production of the pro-alpha1(XI) chain. Researchers speculate that a loss of this chain changes the structure of type XI collagen molecules and disrupts its ability to form cross-links. However, the effects of these mutations are still under study. "

289,COL17A1 ,collagen type XVII alpha 1 chain,"The COL17A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is used to assemble type XVII collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support connective tissues, such as skin, bone, tendons, and ligaments, throughout the body. In particular, type XVII collagen plays an essential role in strengthening and stabilizing the skin.The protein produced from the COL17A1 gene is known as a pro-α1(XVII) chain. Three identical pro-α1(XVII) chains twist together to form a triple-stranded, ropelike molecule known as a procollagen. Procollagen molecules are released from the cell and processed by enzymes to remove extra protein segments from the ends. Once these molecules are processed, they arrange themselves into long, thin bundles of mature type XVII collagen.Type XVII collagen is a major component of hemidesmosomes, which are microscopic structures on the inner surface of the top layer of skin (the epidermis). These structures help to anchor the epidermis to underlying layers of skin. Type XVII collagen is critical for the stability of hemidesmosomes, and therefore it plays an important role in holding the layers of skin together.","Junctional epidermolysis bullosa More than 100 mutations in the COL17A1 gene have been identified in people with junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB). Most of these mutations add or remove several DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the COL17A1 gene or create a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the pro-α1(XVII) chain. These changes reduce the amount of functional type XVII collagen in the skin. Without enough of this collagen, the epidermis is only weakly attached to underlying layers of skin. Friction or other minor trauma (such as rubbing or scratching) can cause the skin layers to separate, leading to the formation of blisters.Most COL17A1 gene mutations cause the milder form of junctional epidermolysis bullosa, known as JEB generalized intermediate. Affected individuals experience blistering, but it may be limited to the hands, feet, knees, and elbows and often improves after the newborn period. A few individuals with mutations in the COL17A1 gene have had the more serious form of the disorder, JEB generalized severe. Infants with JEB generalized severe develop widespread blistering that causes life-threatening complications. "
290,COL18A1 ,collagen type XVIII alpha 1 chain,"The COL18A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms collagen XVIII. Three COL18A1 proteins, called alpha 1 subunits, attach to each other to form collagen XVIII. Collagen XVIII is found in the basement membranes of tissues throughout the body. Basement membranes are thin, sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in these tissues.There are three versions (isoforms) of the alpha 1 subunit of collagen XVIII, which form three different lengths of the collagen XVIII protein. The short version of collagen XVIII is found in basement membranes throughout the body, including several parts of the eye. The two longer versions are found primarily in the liver. In addition, a piece of collagen XVIII can be cut off to form the protein endostatin. Endostatin is able to block the formation of blood vessels (angiogenesis) and is known as an anti-angiogenic factor.Little is known about the function of collagen XVIII, but it appears that all of the isoforms are involved in normal development of the eye.","Knobloch syndrome At least a dozen mutations in the COL18A1 gene have been identified in people with Knobloch syndrome, a condition characterized by severe vision problems and a skull defect called an occipital encephalocele. Most COL18A1 gene mutations lead to an abnormally short version of the genetic blueprint used to make the alpha 1 subunit of collagen XVIII. There are a few other mutations that replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the protein sequence. Although the process is unclear, the COL18A1 gene mutations result in the loss of collagen XVIII. Most COL18A1 gene mutations affect all isoforms of collagen XVIII, but at least one mutation affects only the short isoform. The loss of one or all isoforms of the collagen XVIII protein likely causes the signs and symptoms of Knobloch syndrome. It is unclear whether endostatin is involved in this condition. "
291,COLEC10 ,collectin subfamily member 10,"The COLEC10 gene provides instructions for making a protein called collectin liver 1 (CL-L1). This protein is involved in a series of steps called the lectin complement pathway, which is thought to help direct the movement (migration) of cells during development before birth to form the organs and systems of the body. The lectin complement pathway appears to be particularly important in directing the migration of neural crest cells. These cells give rise to various tissues including many tissues in the face and skull, glands that produce hormones (endocrine glands), and portions of the nervous system. After birth, the lectin complement pathway is involved in the immune system.","3MC syndrome At least three COLEC10 gene mutations have been identified in people with 3MC syndrome, a disorder characterized by unusual facial features and a variety of problems affecting other tissues and organs. The COLEC10 gene mutations that cause 3MC syndrome impair or eliminate the function of the CL-L1 protein, resulting in faulty control of cell migration in early development and leading to the various abnormalities that occur in this disorder. Researchers suggest that similar pathways in the immune system can compensate for problems in the lectin complement pathway, which explains why immune system abnormalities are not part of 3MC syndrome.

The COLEC11 gene mutations that cause 3MC syndrome impair or eliminate the function of the CL-K1 protein, resulting in faulty control of cell migration in early development and leading to the various abnormalities that occur in this disorder. Researchers suggest that similar pathways in the immune system can compensate for problems in the lectin complement pathway, which explains why immune system abnormalities are not part of 3MC syndrome. "
293,COLQ ,collagen like tail subunit of asymmetric acetylcholinesterase,The COLQ gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in the neuromuscular junction. The neuromuscular junction is the area between the ends of nerve cells and muscle cells where signals are relayed to trigger muscle movement.The ColQ protein anchors another protein called acetylcholinesterase to the muscle cell membrane at the neuromuscular junction. The ColQ protein is made up of three identical parts (subunits). Each subunit attaches (binds) to a bundle of four acetylcholinesterase proteins. Acetylcholinesterase plays a role in regulating the length of signaling between nerve cells and muscle cells by breaking down the signaling protein acetylcholine.,"Congenital myasthenic syndrome More than 35 mutations in the COLQ gene have been found to cause congenital myasthenic syndrome. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ColQ protein or lead to the production of a shortened, nonfunctional protein. A lack of functional ColQ protein leads to a reduction in the amount of acetylcholinesterase that is available in the neuromuscular junction. As a result, acetylcholine is not broken down so signaling between nerve and muscle cells is prolonged. This signaling overload can damage muscle cells, leading to the muscle weakness characteristic of congenital myasthenic syndrome. "
294,COMP ,cartilage oligomeric matrix protein,"The COMP gene provides the instructions for making the COMP protein. This protein is found in the extracellular matrix, which is an intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. Specifically, the COMP protein is located in the extracellular matrix surrounding the cells that make up ligaments and tendons, and near cartilage-forming cells (chondrocytes). Chondrocytes play an important role in bone formation (osteogenesis). In the bones of the spine, hips, and limbs, the process of osteogenesis starts with the formation of cartilage, which is then converted into bone.The normal function of the COMP protein is not fully known. It is believed to play a role in cell growth and division (proliferation) and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis), as well as in the regulation of cell movement and attachment. Research has also shown that the COMP protein binds strongly to calcium.","Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia More than 20 mutations in the COMP gene that cause dominant multiple epiphyseal dysplasia have been identified. This disorder can also be caused by mutations in four other genes; however, the majority of individuals have mutations in the COMP gene.Mutations in the COMP gene that cause dominant multiple epiphyseal dysplasia change one protein building block (amino acid) or result in small additions or deletions of amino acids in the COMP protein. All identified mutations have occurred in two regions of the COMP protein, which are referred to as the type III and C-terminal domains. COMP mutations lead to the improper folding of the COMP protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, a structure in the cell involved in protein processing and transport. The abnormal COMP protein is unable to leave the endoplasmic reticulum, which causes this cellular structure to enlarge. The endoplasmic reticulum eventually becomes so large that it is no longer able to function normally, and the chondrocyte dies. The premature death of chondrocytes results in diminished growth of the long bones and short stature.Researchers believe that the lack of COMP protein in the spaces between the chondrocytes leads to the formation of abnormal cartilage. This abnormal cartilage probably breaks down easily, which results in early-onset osteoarthritis. "
295,COMT ,catechol-O-methyltransferase,"The COMT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called catechol-O-methyltransferase. Two versions of this enzyme are made from the gene. The longer form, called membrane-bound catechol-O-methyltransferase (MB-COMT), is chiefly produced by nerve cells in the brain. Other tissues, including the liver, kidneys, and blood, produce a shorter form of the enzyme called soluble catechol-O-methyltransferase (S-COMT). This form of the enzyme helps control the levels of certain hormones.In the brain, catechol-O-methyltransferase helps break down certain chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. These chemicals conduct signals from one nerve cell to another. Catechol-O-methyltransferase is particularly important in an area at the front of the brain called the prefrontal cortex, which organizes and coordinates information from other parts of the brain. This region is involved with personality, planning, inhibition of behaviors, abstract thinking, emotion, and working (short-term) memory. To function efficiently, the prefrontal cortex requires signaling by neurotransmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine. Catechol-O-methyltransferase helps maintain appropriate levels of these neurotransmitters in this part of the brain.","22q11.2 deletion syndrome The characteristic signs and symptoms of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome result from a deletion of a small piece of chromosome 22. The chromosomal region that is typically deleted contains 30 to 40 genes, including the COMT gene. As a result of the deletion, people with this disorder have only one copy of the COMT gene in each cell instead of the usual two copies.A loss of one copy of the COMT gene in each cell leads to abnormal regulation of catechol-O-methyltransferase levels in the brain. Researchers believe that changes involving this enzyme in the prefrontal cortex may help explain the increased risk of behavioral problems and mental illness associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Little is known, however, about the relationship between catechol-O-methyltransferase activity and the specific mental and emotional problems characteristic of this condition. People with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are much more likely than people without the condition to develop schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. "
296,COQ2 ,"coenzyme Q2, polyprenyltransferase","The COQ2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that carries out one step in the production of a molecule called coenzyme Q10, which has several critical functions in cells throughout the body. In cell structures called mitochondria, coenzyme Q10 plays an essential role in a process called oxidative phosphorylation, which converts the energy from food into a form cells can use. Coenzyme Q10 is also involved in producing pyrimidines, which are building blocks of DNA, its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as ATP and GTP that serve as energy sources in the cell. In cell membranes, coenzyme Q10 acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by unstable oxygen-containing molecules (free radicals), which are byproducts of energy production.","Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency At least nine mutations in the COQ2 gene have been found to cause a disorder known as primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. This rare disease usually becomes apparent in infancy or early childhood, but it can occur at any age. It can affect many parts of the body, most often the brain, muscles, and kidneys. The COQ2 gene mutations associated with this disorder greatly reduce or eliminate the production of the COQ2 enzyme, which prevents the normal production of coenzyme Q10. Studies suggest that a shortage (deficiency) of coenzyme Q10 impairs oxidative phosphorylation and increases the vulnerability of cells to damage from free radicals. A deficiency of coenzyme Q10 may also disrupt the production of pyrimidines. These changes can cause cells throughout the body to malfunction, which may help explain the variety of organs and tissues that can be affected by primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. "
297,COQ4 ,coenzyme Q4,"The COQ4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the production of a molecule called coenzyme Q10, although its specific role in this process is unknown. Research suggests that the COQ4 protein may help organize other proteins involved in coenzyme Q10 production into a stable functional group (a protein complex).Coenzyme Q10 has several critical functions in cells throughout the body. In cell structures called mitochondria, coenzyme Q10 plays an essential role in a process called oxidative phosphorylation, which converts the energy from food into a form cells can use. Coenzyme Q10 is also involved in producing pyrimidines, which are building blocks of DNA, its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as ATP and GTP that serve as energy sources in the cell. In cell membranes, coenzyme Q10 acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by unstable oxygen-containing molecules (free radicals), which are byproducts of energy production.","Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency At least 12 mutations in the COQ4 gene have been found to cause a disorder known as primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. This rare disease usually becomes apparent in infancy or early childhood, but it can occur at any age. It can affect many parts of the body, most often the brain, muscles, and kidneys. The COQ4 gene mutations associated with this disorder greatly reduce or eliminate the production of the COQ4 protein, which prevents the normal production of coenzyme Q10. Studies suggest that a shortage (deficiency) of coenzyme Q10 impairs oxidative phosphorylation and increases the vulnerability of cells to damage from free radicals. A deficiency of coenzyme Q10 may also disrupt the production of pyrimidines. These changes can cause cells throughout the body to malfunction, which may help explain the variety of organs and tissues that can be affected by primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. "
298,COQ6 ,"coenzyme Q6, monooxygenase","The COQ6 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that carries out one step in the production of a molecule called coenzyme Q10. Coenzyme Q10 has several critical functions in cells throughout the body. In cell structures called mitochondria, coenzyme Q10 plays an essential role in a process called oxidative phosphorylation, which converts the energy from food into a form cells can use. Coenzyme Q10 is also involved in producing pyrimidines, which are building blocks of DNA, its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as ATP and GTP that serve as energy sources in the cell. In cell membranes, coenzyme Q10 acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by unstable oxygen-containing molecules (free radicals), which are byproducts of energy production.","Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency At least seven mutations in the COQ6 gene have been found to cause a disorder known as primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. This rare disease usually becomes apparent in infancy or early childhood, but it can occur at any age. It can affect many parts of the body, most often the brain, muscles, and kidneys. The COQ6 gene mutations associated with this disorder result in a COQ6 enzyme with an abnormal structure that likely impairs its function, leading to reduced production of coenzyme Q10. Studies suggest that a shortage (deficiency) of coenzyme Q10 impairs oxidative phosphorylation and increases the vulnerability of cells to damage from free radicals. A deficiency of coenzyme Q10 may also disrupt the production of pyrimidines. These changes can cause cells throughout the body to malfunction, which may help explain the variety of organs and tissues that can be affected by primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. "
299,COQ8A ,coenzyme Q8A,"The COQ8A gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the production of a molecule called coenzyme Q10, which has several critical functions in cells throughout the body. In cell structures called mitochondria, coenzyme Q10 plays an essential role in a process called oxidative phosphorylation, which converts the energy from food into a form cells can use. Coenzyme Q10 is also involved in producing pyrimidines, which are building blocks of DNA, its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as ATP and GTP that serve as energy sources in the cell. In cell membranes, coenzyme Q10 acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by unstable oxygen-containing molecules (free radicals), which are byproducts of energy production.","Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency At least 36 mutations in the COQ8A gene have been found to cause a disorder known as primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. This rare disease usually becomes apparent in infancy or early childhood, but it can occur at any age. It can affect many parts of the body, most often the brain, muscles, and kidneys. The COQ8A gene mutations associated with this disorder change the structure of the COQ8A protein or prevent its production, which impairs the normal production of coenzyme Q10. Studies suggest that a shortage (deficiency) of coenzyme Q10 impairs oxidative phosphorylation and increases the vulnerability of cells to damage from free radicals. A deficiency of coenzyme Q10 may also disrupt the production of pyrimidines. These changes can cause cells throughout the body to malfunction, which may help explain the variety of organs and tissues that can be affected by primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. "
300,COQ8B ,coenzyme Q8B,"The COQ8B gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the production of a molecule called coenzyme Q10, which has several critical functions in cells throughout the body. In cell structures called mitochondria, coenzyme Q10 plays an essential role in a process called oxidative phosphorylation, which converts the energy from food into a form cells can use. Coenzyme Q10 is also involved in producing pyrimidines, which are building blocks of DNA, its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as ATP and GTP that serve as energy sources in the cell. In cell membranes, coenzyme Q10 acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by unstable oxygen-containing molecules (free radicals), which are byproducts of energy production.","Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency At least 11 mutations in the COQ8B gene have been found to cause a disorder known as primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. This rare disease usually becomes apparent in infancy or early childhood, but it can occur at any age. It can affect many parts of the body, most often the brain, muscles, and kidneys. The COQ8B gene mutations associated with this disorder greatly reduce or eliminate the function of the COQ8B protein, which prevents the normal production of coenzyme Q10. Studies suggest that a shortage (deficiency) of coenzyme Q10 impairs oxidative phosphorylation and increases the vulnerability of cells to damage from free radicals. A deficiency of coenzyme Q10 may also disrupt the production of pyrimidines. These changes can cause cells throughout the body to malfunction, which may help explain the variety of organs and tissues that can be affected by primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. "
301,CP ,ceruloplasmin,"The CP gene provides instructions for making a protein called ceruloplasmin. Ceruloplasmin helps move iron from the organs and tissues of the body into the blood. This protein prepares iron for incorporation into a molecule called transferrin, which transports the iron to red blood cells.There are two forms of ceruloplasmin. One form, serum ceruloplasmin, is made primarily in the liver. It is involved in transporting iron from most of the body, but is unable to enter the brain. The other form of ceruloplasmin, called the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored form, is important for processing iron in the brain and releasing it from brain tissue. This form of ceruloplasmin is made in nervous system cells called glia, which protect and maintain nerve cells (neurons).","Aceruloplasminemia Approximately 40 mutations in the CP gene that cause aceruloplasminemia have been identified. Some of these mutations substitute one protein building block (amino acid) for another amino acid in the ceruloplasmin protein, resulting in an unstable protein that quickly breaks down (degrades). Other mutations result in the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the protein or prevent the protein from being secreted by the cells in which it is made. Absence of functional ceruloplasmin results in iron transport problems that lead to the iron accumulation, neurological dysfunction, and other health problems seen in aceruloplasminemia. "
302,CPOX ,coproporphyrinogen oxidase,"The CPOX gene provides instructions for making an enzyme known as coproporphyrinogen oxidase. This enzyme is involved in the production of a molecule called heme. Heme is vital for all of the body's organs, although it is most abundant in the blood, bone marrow, and liver. Heme is an essential component of iron-containing proteins called hemoproteins, including hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in the blood).The production of heme is a multi-step process that requires eight different enzymes. Coproporphyrinogen oxidase is responsible for the sixth step in this process, the removal of carbon and oxygen atoms from coproporphyrinogen III (the product of the fifth step) to form protoporphyrinogen IX. In subsequent steps, two other enzymes modify protoporphyrinogen IX and incorporate an iron atom to produce heme.","Porphyria At least 45 mutations in the CPOX gene have been found to cause porphyria. Mutations in this gene can cause two types of porphyria: hereditary coproporphyria and a variant known as harderoporphyria.Most CPOX gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in coproporphyrinogen oxidase. A single mutation appears to be responsible for harderoporphyria; this genetic change replaces the amino acid glycine with the amino acid glutamic acid at position 404 (written as Lys404Glu or K404E). Mutations in the CPOX gene reduce the activity of coproporphyrinogen oxidase, allowing compounds called porphyrins to build up in the body. These compounds are formed during the normal process of heme production, but reduced activity of coproporphyrinogen oxidase allows them to accumulate to toxic levels. This buildup, in combination with nongenetic factors such as certain drugs, alcohol, and dieting, leads to the signs and symptoms of hereditary coproporphyria and harderoporphyria. "
303,CPS1 ,carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1,"The CPS1 gene provides instructions for making the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I. This enzyme participates in the urea cycle, a series of reactions that occurs in liver cells. The urea cycle processes excess nitrogen, generated when protein is used by the body, into a compound called urea that is excreted by the kidneys. Excreting the excess nitrogen prevents it from accumulating in the form of ammonia, which is toxic.The specific role of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I is to control the first step of the urea cycle, a reaction in which excess nitrogen compounds are incorporated into the cycle to be processed.","Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency Approximately 10 mutations that cause carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency have been identified in the CPS1 gene. A mutated CPS1 gene may result in a carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I enzyme that is shorter than normal or the wrong shape, or may prevent the enzyme from being produced at all.The shape of an enzyme affects its ability to control a chemical reaction. If the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase enzyme is misshapen or missing, it cannot fulfill its role in the urea cycle. Excess nitrogen is not converted to urea for excretion, and ammonia accumulates in the body. Ammonia is toxic, especially to the nervous system, so this accumulation causes neurological problems and other signs and symptoms of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency. "
304,CPT1A ,carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A,"The CPT1A gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, which is found in the liver. This enzyme is essential for fatty acid oxidation, a multistep process that breaks down (metabolizes) fats and converts them into energy. Fatty acid oxidation takes place within mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers in cells. A group of fats called long-chain fatty acids cannot enter mitochondria unless they are attached to a substance known as carnitine. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A connects carnitine to long-chain fatty acids so they can cross the inner membrane of mitochondria. Once these fatty acids are inside mitochondria, carnitine is removed and they can be metabolized to produce energy. During periods of fasting, long-chain fatty acids are an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.","Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency More than 20 mutations in the CPT1A gene have been found to cause carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) deficiency. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) within carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A. Mutations in the CPT1A gene severely reduce or eliminate the activity of this enzyme. Without enough of this enzyme, carnitine is not attached to long-chain fatty acids. As a result, these fatty acids cannot enter mitochondria and be converted into energy. Reduced energy production can lead to some of the features of CPT I deficiency, such as low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and low levels of the products of fat breakdown (hypoketosis). Fatty acids may also build up in cells and damage the liver, heart, and brain. This abnormal buildup causes the other signs and symptoms of the disorder. "
305,CPT2 ,carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2,"The CPT2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2. This enzyme is essential for fatty acid oxidation, a multistep process that breaks down (metabolizes) fats and converts them into energy. Fatty acid oxidation takes place within mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers in cells. A group of fats called long-chain fatty acids must be attached to a substance known as carnitine to enter mitochondria. Once these fatty acids are inside mitochondria, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 removes the carnitine and adds a substance called coenzyme A. Long-chain fatty acids must be joined to coenzyme A before they can be metabolized to produce energy. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods of fasting, fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.","Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency More than 70 mutations in the CPT2 gene have been found to cause carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) deficiency. These mutations lead to reduced activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2. Mutations that lead to extremely reduced enzyme activity typically cause the more severe forms of CPT II deficiency (a lethal neonatal form and a severe infantile hepatocardiomuscular form), while those that result in partially reduced enzyme activity usually lead to a less severe myopathic form of the disorder. The most common CPT2 gene mutation replaces the protein building block (amino acid) serine with the amino acid leucine at position 113 (written as Ser113Leu or S113L) in the enzyme. This mutation accounts for about 60 percent of the mutations that cause the myopathic form of CPT II deficiency.Without enough functioning carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2, long-chain fatty acids are not properly processed after they enter mitochondria and cannot be metabolized to produce energy. Reduced energy production can lead to some of the features of CPT II deficiency, such as muscle pain and weakness, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), and low levels of the products of fat breakdown (hypoketosis). Fatty acids and long-chain acylcarnitines (fatty acids still attached to carnitine) may also build up in cells and damage the liver, heart, and muscles. This abnormal buildup causes the other signs and symptoms of the disorder. "
306,CRB1 ,"crumbs 1, cell polarity complex component","The CRB1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an essential role in normal vision. This protein is found in the brain and the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color.In the retina, the CRB1 protein appears to be critical for the normal development of light-sensing cells called photoreceptors. Studies suggest that this protein is part of a group (complex) of proteins that help determine the structure and orientation of photoreceptors. The CRB1 protein may also be involved in forming connections between different types of cells in the retina.","Leber congenital amaurosis More than 50 mutations in the CRB1 gene have been found to cause Leber congenital amaurosis. Mutations in this gene account for 9 to 13 percent of all cases of this condition.Most of the CRB1 gene mutations responsible for Leber congenital amaurosis lead to an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the CRB1 protein or significantly reduce the amount of this protein produced in cells. A shortage of the CRB1 protein disrupts the early development of the retina. The retina becomes unusually thick and does not develop the normal layered structure. These changes cause severe visual impairment beginning very early in life. "
307,CREBBP ,CREB binding protein,"The CREBBP gene provides instructions for making CREB binding protein, which regulates the activity of many genes in tissues throughout the body. This protein plays an essential role in controlling cell growth and division and prompting cells to mature and assume specialized functions (differentiate). CREB binding protein appears to be critical for normal development before and after birth. Studies show that this protein is involved in development of the brain and may also be involved in the formation of long-term memories.CREB binding protein carries out its functions by turning on (activating) transcription, which is the first step in the production of proteins from the instructions stored in DNA. The CREB binding protein ensures the DNA is ready for transcription by attaching a small molecule called an acetyl group to proteins called histones (a process called acetylation). Histones are structural proteins that bind DNA and give chromosomes their shape. Acetylation of the histone changes the shape of the chromosome, making genes available for transcription. On the basis of this function, CREB binding protein is called a histone acetyltransferase.In addition, CREB binding protein connects other proteins that start the transcription process (known as transcription factors) with the group of proteins that carries out transcription. On the basis of this function, CREB binding protein is called a transcriptional coactivator.","Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome Mutations in the CREBBP gene have been found to cause Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, a condition characterized by short stature, moderate to severe intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and broad thumbs and first toes. More than 300 mutations have been identified, including the loss (deletion) or addition (insertion) of genetic material in the gene and changes in single DNA building blocks (nucleotides).Because one copy of the CREBBP gene is altered in people with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, their cells make only half of the normal amount of functional CREB binding protein. Although researchers are uncertain how a reduction in the amount of this protein leads to the features of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, it is clear that variations in the CREBBP gene disrupt normal development before and after birth. Problems with development of the brain are thought to underlie intellectual disability in people with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Other features of the condition likely result from abnormal development of other systems.Deletion of genetic material from the short (p) arm of chromosome 16 can cause severe Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, which features an inability to grow or gain weight in infancy, serious infections, and abnormalities of certain organs, such as the heart or spleen, in addition to the classic symptoms of the condition. Multiple genes, including the CREBBP gene, are missing as a result of the deletion. Researchers believe that the loss of multiple genes in this region probably accounts for the serious complications associated with severe Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Some researchers suggest that these cases are a separate condition called chromosome 16p13.3 deletion syndrome. However, a few studies indicate that large deletions in the p arm of chromosome 16 do not always cause severe signs and symptoms, so it is unclear if the disorders are separate. "
308,CRLF1 ,cytokine receptor like factor 1,"The CRLF1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cytokine receptor-like factor 1 (CRLF1). This protein partners with a similar protein called cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1), which is produced from the CLCF1 gene. Together, these two proteins form a unit known as the CRLF1/CLCF1 protein complex. This complex attaches (binds) to a receptor protein known as the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) on the surface of many types of cells. When the CRLF1/CLCF1 protein complex is bound to CNTFR, it triggers signaling inside the cell that affects cell development and function.The CNTFR signaling pathway is primarily involved in the development and maintenance of the nervous system. It promotes the survival of nerve cells (neurons), particularly nerve cells that control muscle movement (motor neurons). The CNTFR pathway also plays a role in a part of the nervous system called the sympathetic nervous system, specifically in the regulation of sweating in response to temperature changes and other factors. This signaling pathway appears to be critical for the normal development and maturation of nerve cells that control the activity of sweat glands.Studies suggest that the CNTFR signaling pathway also has functions outside the nervous system. It may be involved in the body's inflammatory response, which helps fight infection and facilitate tissue repair following an injury. This pathway may also be important for the development and maintenance of bone tissue. However, little is known about the role of CNTFR signaling in these processes.","Cold-induced sweating syndrome At least 10 mutations in the CRLF1 gene have been reported to cause cold-induced sweating syndrome, a rare condition characterized by problems with regulating body temperature and other abnormalities affecting many parts of the body. When this condition is caused by CRLF1 gene mutations, it is known as CISS1.Mutations in the CRLF1 gene lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of the CRLF1 protein or greatly reduce the production of functional CRLF1 protein. Consequently, CRLF1 is unavailable to interact with the CLCF1 protein and bind to CNTFR, which disables the CNTFR signaling pathway.Researchers believe that a failure of CNTFR signaling underlies the major features of cold-induced sweating syndrome. A loss of this signaling pathway during sympathetic nervous system development may help explain the abnormal sweating that is characteristic of this condition, including unusual sweating patterns and related problems with body temperature regulation. The CNTFR pathway's involvement in motor neuron development and bone development provides clues to some of the other signs and symptoms of the disorder, including distinctive facial features, facial muscle weakness, and skeletal abnormalities. However, little is known about how a lack of CNTFR signaling leads to these varied features. "
309,CRPPA ,CDP-L-ribitol pyrophosphorylase A,"The CRPPA gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in a process called glycosylation. Through this chemical process, sugar molecules are added to certain proteins. In particular, the CRPPA protein helps produce a molecule called ribitol 5-phosphate, which is an important component of the chain of sugar molecules added to a protein called alpha (α)-dystroglycan. Glycosylation is critical for the normal function of α-dystroglycan.The α-dystroglycan protein helps anchor the structural framework inside each cell (cytoskeleton) to the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell (extracellular matrix). In skeletal muscles, glycosylated α-dystroglycan helps stabilize and protect muscle fibers. In the brain, it helps direct the movement (migration) of nerve cells (neurons) during early development.","Walker-Warburg syndrome At least 17 mutations in the CRPPA gene have been found to cause Walker-Warburg syndrome, the most severe form of a group of disorders known as congenital muscular dystrophies. Walker-Warburg syndrome causes skeletal muscle weakness and abnormalities of the brain and eyes. Because of the severity of the problems caused by this condition, affected individuals usually do not survive past early childhood.CRPPA gene mutations involved in Walker-Warburg syndrome prevent the normal glycosylation of α-dystroglycan. As a result, α-dystroglycan can no longer effectively anchor cells to the proteins and other molecules that surround them. Without functional α-dystroglycan to stabilize the muscle fibers, they become damaged as they repeatedly contract and relax with use. The damaged fibers weaken and die over time, which affects the development, structure, and function of skeletal muscles in people with Walker-Warburg syndrome.Defective α-dystroglycan also affects the migration of neurons during the early development of the brain. Instead of stopping when they reach their intended destinations, some neurons migrate past the surface of the brain into the fluid-filled space that surrounds it. Researchers believe that this problem with neuronal migration causes a brain abnormality called cobblestone lissencephaly, in which the surface of the brain lacks the normal folds and grooves and instead appears bumpy and irregular. Less is known about the effects of CRPPA gene mutations on other parts of the body. "
310,CRX ,cone-rod homeobox,"The CRX gene provides instructions for making a protein called the cone-rod homeobox protein. This protein is found in the eyes, specifically in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye called the retina. The cone-rod homeobox protein attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. On the basis of this action, this protein is called a transcription factor.In the retina, the cone-rod homeobox protein is necessary for the normal development of light-detecting cells called photoreceptors. Through its actions as a transcription factor, the cone-rod homeobox protein helps photoreceptor cells mature into two types: rods and cones. Rods are needed for vision in low light, while cones are needed for vision in bright light, including color vision. The protein also helps maintain these cells and preserve vision.","Cone-rod dystrophy More than 20 mutations in the CRX gene have been found to cause cone-rod dystrophy. The problems associated with this condition include a loss of visual sharpness (acuity), an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), and impaired color vision. These vision problems worsen over time. Cone-rod dystrophy is caused by mutations that occur in one of the two copies of the CRX gene in each cell. CRX gene mutations are responsible for about one-quarter of the cases of a form of the condition called autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy. These mutations lead to a reduction in the amount of functional cone-rod homeobox protein that is available to regulate other genes in the retina. As a result, maintenance of the rod and cone cells is insufficient and these cells deteriorate over time, leading to the vision problems characteristic of cone-rod dystrophy. Researchers believe that there is enough cone-rod homeobox protein function to allow for photoreceptor cell differentiation, but long-term maintenance of the cells cannot be sustained.Several CRX gene mutations have been found to cause different forms of vision loss in different individuals. It is unclear how mutations in the CRX gene can cause different eye disorders. "
311,CSF1R ,colony stimulating factor 1 receptor,"The CSF1R gene provides instructions for making a protein called the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1 receptor). This protein is found in the outer membrane of certain cell types. When a specific protein called colony stimulating factor 1 attaches (binds) to it, the receptor turns on (activates) a series of proteins inside the cell that are part of multiple signaling pathways. The signaling pathways stimulated by the CSF-1 receptor control many important cellular processes such as cell growth and division (proliferation) and maturation of cells to take on specific functions (differentiation).In the brain, the CSF-1 receptor is abundant in the membrane of specialized cells called glial cells. These cells protect and maintain nerve cells (neurons). The CSF-1 receptor is thought to be involved in the proliferation and differentiation of glial cells, but its exact role in the brain is unclear.","Adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia More than a dozen mutations in the CSF1R gene have been found in people with adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP). ALSP is a severe neurological disorder characterized by damage to a type of brain tissue called white matter. Symptoms of this condition typically begin in adulthood and progress to severe cognitive and movement problems. Most CSF1R gene mutations in ALSP change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the CSF-1 receptor. Other mutations change the sequence of amino acids in other ways. The mutations all occur in the region of the receptor that activates other proteins (called the kinase domain). It is likely that the altered receptor is unable to stimulate cell signaling pathways. However, it is unclear how the gene mutations lead to white matter damage or cognitive and movement problems in people with ALSP. "
312,CST3 ,cystatin C,"The CST3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cystatin C. This protein is part of a family of proteins called cysteine protease inhibitors that help control several types of chemical reactions by blocking (inhibiting) the activity of certain enzymes. Cystatin C inhibits the activity of enzymes called cathepsins that cut apart other proteins in order to break them down.Cystatin C is found in biological fluids, such as blood. Its levels are especially high in the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord (the cerebrospinal fluid or CSF).","Hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy At least one mutation in the CST3 gene has been found to cause hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a condition characterized by stroke and a decline in intellectual function (dementia), which begins in mid-adulthood. The CST3 gene mutation that has been identified causes a form of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy known as the Icelandic type. This mutation replaces the protein building block (amino acid) leucine with the amino acid glutamine at position 68 in the cystatin C protein (written as Leu68Gln or L68Q). This abnormal cystatin C protein is less stable and is more prone to cluster together (aggregate) than the normal protein. The aggregated protein forms clumps called amyloid deposits that accumulate in the blood vessel walls primarily in the brain, but also in blood vessels in other areas of the body such as the skin, spleen, and lymph nodes. The accumulation of these amyloid deposits, known as plaques, does not appear to have any health effects outside of the brain. In the brain, the amyloid plaques replace the muscle fibers and elastic fibers that give blood vessels flexibility, causing them to become weak and prone to breakage. Such a break in the brain causes bleeding (hemorrhagic stroke), which can lead to brain damage and dementia. "
313,CSTB ,cystatin B,"The CSTB gene provides instructions for making a protein called cystatin B. This protein reduces the activity of (inhibits) enzymes called cathepsins. Cathepsins help break down certain proteins in the lysosomes (compartments in the cell that digest and recycle materials). While the specific function of cystatin B is unclear, it may help protect the cells' proteins from cathepsins that leak out of the lysosomes.One region of the CSTB gene has a particular repeating sequence of 12 DNA building blocks (nucleotides) written as CCCCG-CCCCG-CG. This sequence, called a dodecamer repeat, is usually repeated two or three times within a part of the gene that helps regulate cystatin B protein production.","Unverricht-Lundborg disease In almost all affected individuals, Unverricht-Lundborg disease is caused by an increased number of copies (expansion) of the dodecamer repeat in the CSTB gene. Most people with this disorder have more than 30 repeats of the dodecamer sequence in both copies of the CSTB gene.In a small number of individuals, one copy of the CSTB gene has the expanded dodecamer repeat while the second copy carries one of nine other identified mutations. Some of these mutations substitute one protein building block (amino acid) for another amino acid in the cystatin B protein. Others result in a shortened protein that may function improperly or not at all, or cause the protein to be pieced together incorrectly. Only one individual with Unverricht-Lundborg disease has been reported to have mutations other than the dodecamer repeat expansion in both copies of the gene in each cell.The expanded dodecamer repeat in the CSTB gene seems to interfere with the production of cystatin B protein. Levels of cystatin B in affected individuals are only 5 to 10 percent of normal, and cathepsin levels are significantly increased. These changes are believed to cause the signs and symptoms of Unverricht-Lundborg disease, but the specific mechanism is unknown. "
314,CTC1 ,CST telomere replication complex component 1,"The CTC1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in structures known as telomeres, which are found at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres are short, repetitive segments of DNA that help protect chromosomes from abnormally sticking together or breaking down (degrading). In most cells, telomeres become progressively shorter as the cell divides. After a certain number of cell divisions, the telomeres become so short that they trigger the cell to stop dividing or to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis).The CTC1 protein works as part of a group of proteins known as the CST complex, which is involved in the maintenance of telomeres. This complex is part of the special machinery that some cells use to copy (replicate) telomeres so they do not become too short as cells divide. Studies suggest that the CTC1 protein may also have roles in DNA replication unrelated to telomeres, but these functions are not well understood.","Coats plus syndrome At least 20 mutations in the CTC1 gene have been identified in people with Coats plus syndrome. This disorder is characterized by an eye condition called Coats disease plus abnormalities of the brain, bones, gastrointestinal system, and other parts of the body.Most people with Coats plus syndrome have a mutation in one copy of the CTC1 gene in each cell that eliminates the function of the CTC1 protein and a mutation in the other copy of the gene that reduces but does not eliminate the protein's function. This combination of mutations leaves only a small amount of functional CTC1 protein available to work as part of the CST complex. The resulting impairment of this complex affects the replication of telomeres, although the effect on telomere structure and function is unclear. Some studies have found that people with CTC1 gene mutations have abnormally short telomeres, while other studies have found no change in telomere length. Researchers are working to determine how telomeres are different in people with CTC1 gene mutations and how these changes could underlie the varied signs and symptoms of Coats plus syndrome. "
315,CTDP1 ,CTD phosphatase subunit 1,"The CTDP1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called carboxy-terminal domain phosphatase 1. This protein helps regulate the activity of an enzyme called RNA polymerase II. The RNA polymerase II enzyme initiates transcription, which is a key step in using the information carried by genes to direct the production (synthesis) of proteins.","Congenital cataracts, facial dysmorphism, and neuropathy Thus far, everyone with CCFDN has had the same mutation in both copies of the CTDP1 gene in each cell. This mutation, written as IVS6+389C>T, alters the way the gene's instructions are pieced together to produce the carboxy-terminal domain phosphatase 1 protein. The altered instructions introduce a premature stop signal, resulting in an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein that cannot regulate transcription. Defective regulation of the transcription process affects the development and function of many parts of the body. It is not known how nonfunctional carboxy-terminal domain phosphatase 1 protein results in the specific signs and symptoms of CCFDN. "
316,CTNNB1 ,catenin beta 1,"The CTNNB1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called beta-catenin. This protein is present in many types of cells and tissues, where it is primarily found at junctions that connect neighboring cells (adherens junctions). Beta-catenin plays an important role in sticking cells together (cell adhesion) and in communication between cells.The beta-catenin protein is also involved in cell signaling as an essential part of the Wnt signaling pathway. Certain proteins in this pathway attach (bind) to beta-catenin, which triggers a multistep process that allows the protein to move into the cell nucleus. Once in the nucleus, beta-catenin interacts with other proteins to control the activity (expression) of particular genes. The Wnt signaling pathway promotes the growth and division (proliferation) of cells and helps determine the specialized functions a cell will have (differentiation). Wnt signaling is known to be involved in many aspects of development before birth. In adult tissues, this pathway plays a role in the maintenance and renewal of stem cells, which are cells that help repair tissue damage and can give rise to other types of cells.Among its many activities, beta-catenin appears to play an important role in the normal function of hair follicles, which are specialized structures in the skin where hair growth occurs. This protein is active in cells that make up a part of the hair follicle known as the matrix. These cells divide and mature to form the different components of the hair follicle and the hair shaft. As matrix cells divide, the hair shaft is pushed upward and extends beyond the skin.","Desmoid tumor Mutations in the CTNNB1 gene can cause a type of aggressive but noncancerous (benign) growth called a desmoid tumor. CTNNB1 gene mutations are found in about 85 percent of all noninherited (sporadic) desmoid tumors. These rare tumors arise from connective tissue, which provides strength and flexibility to structures such as bones, ligaments, and muscles. The tumors are often found in the abdomen, shoulders, upper arms, or upper legs. The CTNNB1 gene mutations that cause desmoid tumors are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in tumor cells. Somatic mutations are not inherited.The CTNNB1 gene mutations that cause desmoid tumors usually occur in a region of the gene called exon 3. They change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the beta-catenin protein. These mutations lead to an abnormally stable beta-catenin protein that is not broken down when it is no longer needed. As a result, the protein accumulates within cells. Excess beta-catenin promotes the uncontrolled proliferation of cells, allowing the formation of desmoid tumors. "
317,CTNND1 ,catenin delta 1,"The CTNND1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called p120-catenin, also known as delta 1 catenin. This protein and others in the catenin family interact with proteins from another family called cadherins. Catenins and cadherins form protein complexes that help cells stick to neighboring cells (cell adhesion) to form organized tissues. In addition to their role in cell adhesion, catenin and cadherin interactions help transmit chemical signals within cells, control cell maturation and movement, and regulate the activity of certain genes.The p120-catenin protein interacts with a protein called E-cadherin, which is produced from the CDH1 gene. The E-cadherin protein is found within the membrane that surrounds epithelial cells, which are the cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body, including the inside of the eyelids and the mouth. The p120-catenin protein helps keep E-cadherin in its proper place in the cell membrane, preventing it from being taken into the cell through a process called endocytosis and broken down prematurely. Interactions between the two proteins are also important for other cell processes that are involved in the development of the head and face (craniofacial development), including the eyelids and teeth.","Blepharocheilodontic syndrome At least three CTNND1 gene mutations have been identified in people with blepharocheilodontic (BCD) syndrome, a disorder that is present at birth and causes abnormalities mainly affecting the eyelids and mouth. These mutations are thought to prevent the production of the p120-catenin protein or result in an unstable protein that quickly breaks down. A shortage of p120-catenin protein allows E-cadherin to be taken into the cell and destroyed too quickly by endocytosis. A shortage of these proteins disrupts normal development, especially craniofacial development, which is thought to underlie the features of BCD syndrome. "
318,CTNND2 ,catenin delta 2,"The CTNND2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called delta-catenin. This protein is active in the nervous system, where it likely helps cells stick together (cell adhesion) and plays a role in cell movement. In the developing brain, it may help guide nerve cells to their proper positions as part of a process known as neuronal migration.In mature nerve cells, delta-catenin is located in specialized outgrowths called dendrites. Dendrites branch out from the cell and receive information from nearby nerve cells. This information is relayed across synapses, which are junctions between nerve cells where cell-to-cell communication occurs. Delta-catenin appears to play a crucial role in the function of synapses.",Autism spectrum disorder Genetics Home Reference provides information about autism spectrum disorder. 
319,CTNS ,"cystinosin, lysosomal cystine transporter","The CTNS gene provides instructions for making a protein called cystinosin. This protein is located in the membrane of lysosomes, which are compartments in the cell that digest and recycle materials. Proteins digested inside lysosomes are broken down into smaller building blocks, called amino acids. The amino acids are then moved out of lysosomes by transport proteins. Cystinosin is a transport protein that specifically moves the amino acid cystine out of the lysosome.","Cystinosis More than 80 different mutations that are responsible for causing cystinosis have been identified in the CTNS gene. The most common mutation is a deletion of a large part of the CTNS gene (sometimes referred to as the 57-kb deletion), resulting in the complete loss of cystinosin. This deletion is responsible for approximately 50 percent of cystinosis cases in people of European descent. Other mutations result in the production of an abnormally short protein that cannot carry out its normal transport function. Mutations that change very small regions of the CTNS gene may allow the transporter protein to retain some of its usual activity, resulting in a milder form of cystinosis. "
320,CTSA ,cathepsin A,"The CTSA gene provides instructions for making a protein called cathepsin A. Cathepsin A can act as a protease, cutting apart other proteins in order to break them down. Cathepsin A can also act as a protective protein, interacting with other enzymes to prevent them from breaking down prematurely. Based on this protective function, this enzyme is also called protective protein/cathepsin A or PPCA.Cathepsin A is active in cellular compartments called lysosomes. These compartments contain enzymes that digest and recycle materials when they are no longer needed. Cathepsin A interacts with the enzymes β-galactosidase and neuraminidase 1, which play a role in the breakdown of complexes of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) attached to certain proteins (glycoproteins) or fats (glycolipids). Cathepsin A forms a complex with these two enzymes and directs their transport within the cell to the lysosomes. Within lysosomes, cathepsin A activates the enzymes and prevents their breakdown.On the cell surface, cathepsin A forms a complex with neuraminidase 1 and elastin binding protein, forming the elastin binding protein receptor. This receptor complex plays a role in the formation of elastic fibers, which are a component of the connective tissue that forms the body's supportive framework.","Galactosialidosis At least 20 mutations in the CTSA gene have been found to cause galactosialidosis. Most of these mutations change one protein building block (amino acid) in cathepsin A. In the Japanese population, the most common mutation (written as SpDEx7) disrupts how the gene's instructions are used to make the protein.Many CTSA mutations disrupt the protein structure of cathepsin A, impairing its ability to join with neuraminidase 1 and beta-galactosidase or elastin binding protein. As a result, these other enzymes are not functional or they break down prematurely. Most mutations in the CTSA gene cause a lack of functional cathepsin A and a loss of neuraminidase 1, beta-galactosidase, and elastin binding protein. It is not well understood how a lack of these four proteins causes the signs and symptoms of galactosialidosis. "
321,CTSD ,cathepsin D,"The CTSD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called cathepsin D. Cathepsin D is one of a family of cathepsin proteins that act as protease enzymes, which modify proteins by cutting them apart. Cathepsin D is found in many types of cells and is active in lysosomes, which are compartments within cells that digest and recycle different types of molecules. By cutting proteins apart, cathepsin D can break down certain proteins, turn on (activate) other proteins, and regulate self-destruction of the cell (apoptosis).Cathepsin D is produced as an inactive enzyme, called a preproenzyme, which has extra protein segments attached. These segments must be removed, followed by additional processing steps, for the enzyme to become active. The mature, active cathepsin D enzyme is made up of two parts, one light chain and one heavy chain.","CLN10 disease At least seven mutations in the CTSD gene have been found to cause CLN10 disease. The signs and symptoms of CLN10 disease are usually present at birth and include muscle rigidity, respiratory failure, and severe seizures; death typically occurs in infancy. Rarely, CLN10 disease can develop later in life with poor coordination and balance (ataxia), loss of speech, a gradual loss in intellectual functioning (cognitive decline), and vision loss.CTSD gene mutations found to cause CLN10 disease that is present at birth lead to a complete lack of cathepsin D enzyme activity. As a result, proteins and fats are not broken down properly and abnormally accumulate within lysosomes. While these substances accumulate in cells throughout the body, nerve cells appear to be particularly vulnerable to damage caused by the abnormal cell materials. Early and widespread loss of nerve cells in CLN10 disease leads to severe signs and symptoms and death in infancy.In the later-onset cases of CLN10 disease, CTSD gene mutations likely result in the production of a cathepsin D enzyme whose function is greatly reduced but not eliminated. As a result, some proteins and fats are broken down by the enzyme, so it takes longer for these substances to accumulate in lysosomes and cause nerve cell death. "
322,CUBN ,cubilin,"The CUBN gene provides instructions for making a protein called cubilin. This protein is involved in the uptake of vitamin B12 (also called cobalamin) from food into the body. Vitamin B12, which cannot be made in the body and can only be obtained from food, is essential for the formation of DNA and proteins, the production of cellular energy, and the breakdown of fats. This vitamin is involved in the formation of red blood cells and maintenance of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).The cubilin protein is primarily found associated with kidney cells and cells that line the small intestine. Cubilin is anchored to the outer membrane of these cells by its attachment to another protein called amnionless. Cubilin can interact with molecules and proteins passing through the small intestine and kidneys, including vitamin B12. During digestion, vitamin B12 is released from food. As the vitamin passes through the small intestine, cubilin attaches (binds) to it. Amnionless helps transfer the cubilin-vitamin B12 complex into the intestinal cell. From there, the vitamin is released into the blood and transported throughout the body. In the kidneys, cubilin and amnionless are involved in the reabsorption of certain proteins that would otherwise be released in urine.","Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome At least 35 mutations in the CUBN gene have been found to cause a condition called Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome. This condition is characterized by low levels of vitamin B12 in the body, which leads to a blood disorder known as megaloblastic anemia. About half of affected individuals also have excess protein in their urine (proteinuria), and some have neurological problems.The most common CUBN gene mutation, which is found in people of Finnish heritage, changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the cubilin protein; the amino acid proline is replaced by the amino acid leucine at position 1297 (written as Pro1297Leu or P1297L). The protein alteration impairs cubilin's ability to bind to vitamin B12. Instead of being taken up into intestinal cells, the vitamin is released from the body. A shortage of this essential vitamin impairs the proper development of red blood cells, leading to megaloblastic anemia. In addition, low levels of vitamin B12 can affect the central nervous system, causing neurological problems.Other CUBN gene mutations prevent cubilin from attaching to the amnionless protein or lead to a reduction in the amount or function of the cubilin protein. These changes impair cubilin's function in the kidneys as well as in the small intestine. Without amnionless function in the kidneys, proteins are not reabsorbed into the body and are instead released in the urine, leading to proteinuria. Individuals with these mutations develop megaloblastic anemia and proteinuria. "
323,CUL3 ,cullin 3,"The CUL3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cullin-3. This protein plays a role in the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unwanted proteins, called the ubiquitin-proteasome system.Cullin-3 is a core piece of a complex known as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. E3 ubiquitin ligases function as part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system by tagging damaged and excess proteins with molecules called ubiquitin. Ubiquitin serves as a signal to specialized cell structures known as proteasomes, which attach (bind) to the tagged proteins and degrade them. The ubiquitin-proteasome system acts as the cell's quality control system by disposing of damaged, misshapen, and excess proteins. This system also regulates the level of proteins involved in several critical cell activities such as the timing of cell division and growth.E3 ubiquitin ligases containing the cullin-3 protein tag proteins called WNK1 and WNK4 with ubiquitin. These proteins are involved in controlling blood pressure in the body. By regulating the amount of WNK1 and WNK4 available, cullin-3 plays a role in blood pressure control.","Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 At least 17 mutations in the CUL3 gene can cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 (PHA2), a condition characterized by high blood pressure (hypertension) and high levels of potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia). These mutations lead to production of an abnormally short cullin-3 protein that is missing a region. Studies show that this change alters the function of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The change leads to impaired degradation of the WNK4 protein, although the exact mechanism is unclear. The resulting excess of WNK4 protein disrupts normal control of blood pressure, causing hypertension and other features of PHA2. It is unknown if WNK1 is affected by the alterations to the E3 ubiquitin ligase or whether WNK1 plays a role in PHA2 caused by CUL3 gene mutations. "
324,CUL7 ,cullin 7,"The CUL7 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cullin-7. This protein plays a role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unwanted proteins.Cullin-7 helps assemble a complex known as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This complex tags damaged and excess proteins with molecules called ubiquitin. Ubiquitin serves as a signal to specialized cell structures known as proteasomes, which attach (bind) to the tagged proteins and degrade them. The ubiquitin-proteasome system acts as the cell's quality control system by disposing of damaged, misshapen, and excess proteins. This system also regulates the level of proteins involved in several critical cell activities such as the timing of cell division and growth. In particular, cullin-7 is thought to help regulate proteins involved in the body's response to growth hormones, although its specific role in this process is unknown.","3-M syndrome At least 73 mutations in the CUL7 gene have been identified in people with 3-M syndrome, a disorder that causes skeletal anomalies including short stature (dwarfism) and unusual facial features. Most of these mutations substitute one protein building block (amino acid) for another amino acid in the cullin-7 protein or result in a cullin-7 protein that is abnormally short and nonfunctional.Individuals in the Yakut population of the Russian province of Siberia with a variant of 3-M syndrome all have a particular mutation in both copies of the CUL7 gene in each cell. This mutation replaces the amino acid glutamine with a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the cullin-7 protein (written as Gln1553Ter or Q1553X), leading to production of an abnormally short protein.Mutations in the CUL7 gene, including the Gln1553Ter mutation, prevent the cullin-7 protein from bringing together the components of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, interfering with the process of tagging unneeded proteins for degradation. The body's response to growth hormones may be impaired as a result. However, the specific relationship between CUL7 gene mutations and the signs and symptoms of 3-M syndrome are unknown. "
325,CXCR4 ,C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4,"The CXCR4 gene provides instructions for making a receptor protein that spans the outer membrane of cells, specifically white blood cells and cells in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. After attachment of its ligand, called SDF-1, the CXCR4 protein turns on (activates) signaling pathways inside the cell. These pathways help regulate cell growth and division (proliferation), the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and cell survival. Once signaling is stimulated, the CXCR4 protein is removed from the cell membrane (internalized) and broken down so it can no longer activate the signaling pathways.The CXCR4 receptor is also involved in the movement (migration) of cells. Cells that have the CXCR4 protein in their membrane are attracted to SDF-1. High levels of this ligand are found in the bone marrow, which helps certain blood cells migrate to and stay in the bone marrow until they are needed elsewhere in the body. Retention of early blood cells known as hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow is important to ensure that stem cells are available when needed. White blood cells also remain in the bone marrow until they are needed in the body to fight infection.","Waldenström macroglobulinemia Mutations in the CXCR4 gene are found in approximately 30 percent of people with Waldenström macroglobulinemia. This rare form of blood cancer is characterized by an excess of abnormal white blood cells called lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone marrow and overproduction of a protein called IgM. These mutations are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in the abnormal white blood cells. This type of genetic change, called a somatic mutation, is not inherited. Waldenström macroglobulinemia is thought to result from multiple genetic changes, one of which can be a CXCR4 gene mutation.CXCR4 gene mutations involved in Waldenström macroglobulinemia lead to production of an abnormally short CXCR4 protein that cannot be internalized, prolonging signaling activated by the protein. This signaling leads to enhanced survival and proliferation of cells containing the abnormal protein, which may contribute to the abundance of lymphoplasmacytic cells characteristic of Waldenström macroglobulinemia. "
326,CYB5R3 ,cytochrome b5 reductase 3,"The CYB5R3 gene provides instruction for making an enzyme called cytochrome b5 reductase 3. This enzyme is involved in transferring negatively charged particles called electrons from one molecule to another. Two versions (isoforms) of this enzyme are produced from the CYB5R3 gene. The soluble isoform is present only in red blood cells, and the membrane-bound isoform is found in all other cell types.Normal red blood cells contain molecules of iron-containing hemoglobin, which deliver oxygen to the body's tissues. The iron in hemoglobin is ferrous (Fe2+), but it can spontaneously become ferric (Fe3+). Hemoglobin that contains ferric iron is called methemoglobin, and it cannot deliver oxygen. The soluble isoform of cytochrome b5 reductase 3 changes ferric iron back to ferrous iron so hemoglobin can function. Normally, red blood cells contain less than 2 percent methemoglobin.The membrane-bound isoform is embedded in the membranes of various cellular compartments and is widely used in the body. This isoform is necessary for many chemical reactions, including the breakdown and formation of fatty acids, the formation of cholesterol, and the breakdown of various molecules and drugs.","Autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia More than 65 mutations in the CYB5R3 gene have been found to cause autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia types I and II. Most of these CYB5R3 gene mutations cause autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia type I, which is characterized by a lack of oxygen in the body's tissues and bluish appearance of the skin, lips, and nails (cyanosis). The mutations that cause type I usually reduce enzyme activity or stability. As a result, the enzyme cannot efficiently change ferric iron to ferrous iron, leading to a 10 to 50 percent increase in methemoglobin within red blood cells. This increase in methemoglobin and corresponding decrease in normal hemoglobin reduces the amount of oxygen delivered to tissues. The altered enzyme activity affects only red blood cells because other cells can compensate for a decrease in enzyme activity, but red blood cells cannot.The CYB5R3 gene mutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia type II result in the more severe form of the two types. In addition to cyanosis, people with this form have neurological problems. The mutations that cause type II typically result in a complete loss of enzyme activity. Cells cannot compensate for a complete loss of cytochrome b5 reductase 3, which results in a 10 to 70 percent increase in methemoglobin within red blood cells. This increase in methemoglobin and corresponding decrease in normal hemoglobin leads to cyanosis. The lack of enzyme activity in other cells leads to the neurological features associated with type II. Researchers suspect that the neurological problems are caused by impaired fatty acid and cholesterol formation, which reduces the production of a fatty substance called myelin. Myelin insulates nerve cells and promotes the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. This reduced ability to form myelin (hypomyelination) leads to a loss of nerve cells, particularly in the brain. The loss of these cells likely contributes to the encephalopathy and movement disorders characteristic of autosomal recessive congenital methemoglobinemia type II. "
327,CYBA ,cytochrome b-245 alpha chain,"The CYBA gene provides instructions for making a protein called the cytochrome b-245 alpha chain (also known as p22-phox). This protein is one part (subunit) of a group of proteins that forms an enzyme complex called NADPH oxidase, which plays an essential role in the immune system. Within this complex, the cytochrome b-245 alpha chain has a beta chain partner (produced from the CYBB gene). Both alpha and beta chains are required for either to function, and the NADPH oxidase complex requires both chains in order to be functional. NADPH oxidase is primarily active in immune system cells called phagocytes. These cells catch and destroy foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi. NADPH oxidase is also thought to regulate the activity of immune cells called neutrophils. These cells play a role in adjusting the inflammatory response to optimize healing and reduce injury to the body.The presence of foreign invaders stimulates phagocytes and triggers the assembly of NADPH oxidase. This enzyme participates in a chemical reaction that converts oxygen to a toxic molecule called superoxide. Superoxide is used to generate several other compounds, including hydrogen peroxide (a strong disinfectant) and hypochlorous acid (the active ingredient in bleach). These highly reactive, toxic substances are known as reactive oxygen species. Phagocytes use these substances to kill foreign invaders, preventing them from reproducing in the body and causing illness.","Chronic granulomatous disease More than 40 mutations in the CYBA gene have been found to cause chronic granulomatous disease. People with this disorder are at increased risk of developing recurrent episodes of infection and inflammation due to a weakened immune system. Mutations in the CYBA gene cause less than 5 percent of all cases of this condition. Most of these mutations change single building blocks of protein (amino acids) in the cytochrome b-245 alpha chain or cause it to be abnormally short and nonfunctional. An altered protein not only diminishes the function of the alpha chain, but the function of its beta chain partner as well. Without these subunits, NADPH oxidase cannot assemble or function properly. As a result, phagocytes are unable to produce reactive oxygen species to kill foreign invaders, and neutrophil activity is not regulated. A lack of NADPH oxidase leaves affected individuals vulnerable to many types of infection and excessive inflammation. "
328,CYBB ,cytochrome b-245 beta chain,"The CYBB gene provides instructions for making a protein called cytochrome b-245, beta chain (also known as p91-phox). This protein is one part (subunit) of a group of proteins that forms an enzyme complex called NADPH oxidase, which plays an essential role in the immune system. Within this complex, the cytochrome b-245, beta chain has an alpha chain partner (produced from the CYBA gene). Both alpha and beta chains are required for either to function and the NADPH oxidase complex requires both chains in order to be functional. NADPH oxidase is primarily active in immune system cells called phagocytes. These cells catch and destroy foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi. NADPH oxidase is also thought to regulate the activity of immune cells called neutrophils. These cells play a role in adjusting the inflammatory response to optimize healing and reduce injury to the body.The presence of foreign invaders stimulates phagocytes and triggers the assembly of NADPH oxidase.

These highly reactive, toxic substances are known as reactive oxygen species. Phagocytes use these substances to kill foreign invaders, preventing them from reproducing in the body and causing illness.","Chronic granulomatous disease More than 650 mutations in the CYBB gene have been found to cause chronic granulomatous disease. People with this disorder are at increased risk of developing recurrent episodes of infection and inflammation due to a weakened immune system. Mutations in the CYBB gene cause approximately 70 percent of all cases of this condition. Most of these mutations change single building blocks of protein (amino acids) in the cytochrome b-245 beta chain or cause it to be abnormally short and nonfunctional. An altered protein not only diminishes the function of the beta chain, but the function of its alpha chain partner as well. Without these subunits, NADPH oxidase cannot assemble or function properly. As a result, phagocytes are unable to produce reactive oxygen species to kill foreign invaders, and neutrophil activity is not regulated. A lack of NADPH oxidase leaves affected individuals vulnerable to many types of infection and excessive inflammation. "
329,CYLD ,CYLD lysine 63 deubiquitinase,"The CYLD gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps regulate nuclear factor-kappa-B. Nuclear factor-kappa-B is a group of related proteins that help protect cells from self-destruction (apoptosis) in response to certain signals. In regulating the action of nuclear factor-kappa-B, the CYLD protein allows cells to respond properly to signals to self-destruct when appropriate, such as when the cells become abnormal. By this mechanism, the CYLD protein acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it helps prevent cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way.","Brooke-Spiegler syndrome At least 20 CYLD gene mutations have been identified in individuals with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome. This condition is characterized by multiple noncancerous (benign) tumors that develop in structures associated with the skin (skin appendages), such as sweat glands and hair follicles. People with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome may develop several types of skin appendage tumors, including growths called spiradenomas, trichoepitheliomas, and cylindromas. Spiradenomas are tumors of the sweat glands. Trichoepitheliomas arise from the hair follicles. While previously thought to derive from sweat glands, cylindromas are now generally believed to begin in hair follicles.People with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome are born with a mutation in one of the two copies of the CYLD gene in each cell. This mutation prevents the cell from making functional CYLD protein from the altered copy of the gene. However, enough protein is usually produced from the other, normal copy of the gene to regulate cell growth effectively. For tumors to develop, a second mutation or deletion of genetic material involving the other copy of the CYLD gene must occur in certain cells during a person's lifetime. These genetic changes are called somatic mutations and are not inherited.When both copies of the CYLD gene are mutated in a particular cell, that cell cannot produce any functional CYLD protein. The loss of this protein impairs the regulation of nuclear factor-kappa-B, allowing the cell to grow and divide in an uncontrolled way to form a tumor. In people with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, second CYLD mutations typically occur in different types of cells in the skin over an affected person's lifetime, leading to the growth of multiple types of skin appendage tumors. "
330,CYP1B1 ,cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily B member 1,"The CYP1B1 gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme that is a member of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. These enzymes are involved in many processes in the body, such as assisting with reactions that break down drugs and produce certain fats (lipids). The CYP1B1 enzyme participates in biochemical reactions in which an oxygen atom is added to other molecules.The CYP1B1 enzyme is active in many tissues, including structures of the eye. The function of the CYP1B1 enzyme in the development of the eye is unclear, but it may play a role in forming structures at the front of the eye and may also be involved in a process that regulates the secretion of fluid inside the eye.","Early-onset glaucoma More than 140 CYP1B1 gene mutations have been identified to cause early-onset glaucoma. People with this condition experience increased pressure within the eye before the age of 40. This pressure causes damage to the optic nerves connecting the eyes and the brain. Between 20 percent and 40 percent of people with glaucoma before the age of 5 (primary congenital glaucoma) have mutations in the CYP1B1 gene. The mutations that cause early-onset glaucoma may result in an enzyme that is unstable or the wrong shape.It is not well understood how defects in the CYP1B1 enzyme cause signs and symptoms of glaucoma. Recent studies suggest that the defects may interfere with the early development of the trabecular meshwork, which is a network of mesh-like canals that helps drain excess fluid from the eye. If fluid cannot be drained, pressure inside the eye may increase, which is characteristic of glaucoma.The CYP1B1 enzyme may interact with another protein called myocilin, which is produced from the MYOC gene. Individuals with mutations in both the MYOC and CYP1B1 genes may develop glaucoma at an earlier age and have more severe symptoms than do those with mutations in only one of the genes. "
331,CYP2C9 ,cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C member 9,"The CYP2C9 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found in a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein processing and transport. The CYP2C9 enzyme breaks down (metabolizes) compounds including steroid hormones and fatty acids. The CYP2C9 enzyme also plays a major role in breaking down the drug warfarin, which thins the blood and prevents blood clots from forming. This enzyme also assists in metabolizing other drugs such as ibuprofen, which reduces inflammation.","Warfarin sensitivity Certain common CYP2C9 gene variations (polymorphisms) have been associated with warfarin sensitivity, a condition in which individuals require lower doses of the drug warfarin than are usually prescribed. Warfarin is an anticoagulant, which means that it thins the blood, preventing blood clots from forming.The CYP2C9 gene polymorphisms associated with warfarin sensitivity change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the CYP2C9 enzyme. The altered enzyme slows the breakdown (metabolism) of warfarin, allowing the drug to remain active in the body for a longer period of time. People with warfarin sensitivity take longer than usual to metabolize warfarin and may require lower doses of the drug than are usually prescribed.The two most common CYP2C9 polymorphisms in people of European ancestry are known as CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3. Both of these polymorphisms lead to a decrease in warfarin metabolism to such degrees that prescription doses are typically reduced by one-third and one-fifth, respectively. In individuals with African ancestry, the four most common CYP2C9 polymorphisms associated with warfarin sensitivity are known as CYP2C9*5, CYP2C9*6, CYP2C9*8, and CYP2C9*11. These polymorphisms lead to a decrease in warfarin metabolism that would necessitate a reduction in prescription doses by one-third to one-sixth. In other populations, the effects of these polymorphisms are less certain but are an active area of research.In rare cases in which individuals have more than one CYP2C9 polymorphisms, the enzyme activity is severely decreased and metabolism of warfarin is very slow. If people with warfarin sensitivity take the average dose (or more) of warfarin, they are at risk of an overdose, which can cause abnormal bleeding in the brain, gastrointestinal tract, or other tissues, and may lead to serious health problems or death. "
332,CYP2C19 ,cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C member 19,"The CYP2C19 gene is a member of the cytochrome P450 gene family. Enzymes produced from cytochrome P450 genes are involved in the formation and breakdown (metabolism) of various molecules and chemicals within cells. The CYP2C19 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found primarily in liver cells in a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein processing and transport.The CYP2C19 enzyme plays a role in the processing or metabolizing of at least 10 percent of commonly prescribed drugs, including a drug called clopidogrel (also known as Plavix). Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet drug, which means that it prevents blood cells called platelets from sticking together (aggregating) and forming blood clots. The CYP2C19 enzyme converts clopidogrel to its active form, which is necessary for the drug to function in the body. The active drug then stops (inhibits) a receptor protein known as P2RY12 that is found on the surface of platelets. During clot formation, the P2RY12 receptor protein helps platelets cluster together to form a clot in order to seal off damaged blood vessels and prevent blood loss.","Clopidogrel resistance Multiple variations (polymorphisms) in the CYP2C19 gene have been associated with clopidogrel resistance, a condition in which the drug clopidogrel is less effective than normal in people who are treated with it. The polymorphisms that are associated with clopidogrel resistance decrease the enzyme's ability to convert the drug to its active form.The normal version of the gene, written as CYP2C19*1, provides instructions for producing a normally functioning CYP2C19 enzyme. If a person has two copies of the CYP2C19*1 version of the gene in each cell, they are able to convert clopidogrel normally. The two most common CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms associated with clopidogrel resistance (known as CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3) result in the production of a nonfunctional CYP2C19 enzyme that is unable to activate clopidogrel.Individuals with clopidogrel resistance can be classified into two groups: intermediate metabolizers or poor metabolizers. People who have one copy of the CYP2C19*1 version of the gene and one copy of either the CYP2C19*2 or CYP2C19*3 version of the gene have a reduced ability to convert clopidogrel to its active form and are classified as intermediate metabolizers. People who have the CYP2C19*2 or CYP2C19*3 versions of the gene for both copies of the gene can convert very little or none of the drug and are classified as poor metabolizers. Because conversion of clopidogrel to its active form is impaired in people with clopidogrel resistance, the drug is unable to inhibit P2RY12 receptor function. Without active clopidogrel to interfere, the P2RY12 receptor continues to promote platelet aggregation and blood clot formation, which can lead to heart attacks, strokes, and thromboses in individuals with a history of these conditions.It is important to note that not all individuals with CYP2C19 gene mutations have clopidogrel resistance. These individuals who are at increased risk for developing clopidogrel resistance may or may not have a bad reaction when treated with the drug. In addition to changes in specific genes, many other factors, including gender, age, weight, diet, and other medications, play a role in how the body reacts to clopidogrel. "
333,CYP2R1 ,cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily R member 1,"The CYP2R1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 25-hydroxylase. This enzyme carries out the first of two reactions to convert vitamin D to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, also known as calcitriol. Vitamin D can be acquired from foods in the diet or can be made in the body with the help of sunlight exposure. When active, this vitamin is involved in maintaining the proper balance of several minerals in the body, including calcium and phosphate, which are essential for the normal formation of bones and teeth. One of vitamin D's major roles is to control the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the intestines into the bloodstream. Vitamin D is also involved in several processes unrelated to bone and tooth formation.","Vitamin D-dependent rickets At least four mutations in the CYP2R1 gene have been found to cause vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1B (VDDR1B). This disorder of bone development is characterized by low levels of calcium (hypocalcemia) and phosphate (hypophosphatemia) in the blood, which lead to soft, weak bones that are prone to fracture. A common feature of this condition is abnormally curved (bowed) legs.The CYP2R1 gene mutations that cause this condition severely reduce or eliminate the function of 25-hydroxylase. As a result, vitamin D does not get converted to its active form and cannot control mineral absorption. The resulting reduction in calcium and phosphate absorption from the intestines means there is less of these minerals to be deposited in developing bones (bone mineralization), which leads to soft, weak bones and other features of VDDR1B. Hypocalcemia also causes muscle weakness in some affected individuals. "
334,CYP4V2 ,cytochrome P450 family 4 subfamily V member 2,"The CYP4V2 gene provides instructions for making a member of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. These enzymes are involved in the formation and breakdown of various molecules and chemicals within cells. The CYP4V2 enzyme is involved in a multi-step process called fatty acid oxidation in which fats are broken down and converted into energy, but the enzyme's specific function is not well understood.","Bietti crystalline dystrophy At least 42 CYP4V2 gene mutations have been identified in people with Bietti crystalline dystrophy, a disorder in which numerous small, yellow or white crystal-like deposits of fatty (lipid) compounds accumulate in the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (the retina). The deposits damage the retina, resulting in progressive vision loss.CYP4V2 gene mutations that cause Bietti crystalline dystrophy are predicted to change the structure of the CYP4V2 enzyme in a way that reduces or eliminates its activity. The mutations likely affect lipid breakdown; however, it is unknown how they lead to the specific signs and symptoms of Bietti crystalline dystrophy. For unknown reasons, the severity of the signs and symptoms differs significantly among individuals with the same CYP4V2 gene mutation. "
335,CYP7B1 ,cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1,"The CYP7B1 gene is a member of the cytochrome P450 gene family. Enzymes produced from cytochrome P450 genes are involved in the formation and breakdown of various molecules and chemicals within cells. The CYP7B1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called oxysterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase. This enzyme is produced primarily in the liver and the brain. In the liver, oxysterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase is involved in the pathway that breaks down a waxy, fat-like substance called cholesterol to form a bile acid called chenodeoxycholic acid. Bile acids are a component of a digestive fluid called bile that digests fats.In the brain, oxysterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase is also involved in a pathway that converts cholesterol to hormones called neurosteroids. Neurosteroids increase nerve cell activity (excitability) and promote cell survival and communication between nerve cells. The enzyme primarily converts the neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) into 7-hydroxy-DHEA. Oxysterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase helps maintain normal cholesterol levels in the brain and, by producing neurosteroids through altering existing hormones within the pathway, regulates the effects of neurosteroids on the brain.","Spastic paraplegia type 5A At least 37 mutations in the CYP7B1 gene have been found to cause spastic paraplegia type 5A. This condition is characterized by muscle stiffness (spasticity) and severe weakness of the lower limbs (paraplegia), typically beginning in adolescence. Most CYP7B1 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the oxysterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase enzyme. Such changes reduce the enzyme's activity. Other mutations result in a complete loss of functional enzyme.Reduced oxysterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase enzyme activity does not seem to affect cholesterol breakdown or bile acid production in the liver. Another pathway in the liver can perform these functions, which may explain why reduction of oxysterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase activity does not impact liver function.In the brain, a decrease in enzyme activity results in an accumulation of cholesterol and alters neurosteroid production triggered by oxysterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase. Abnormal levels of neurosteroids impairs cell survival, likely leading to nerve cell death. The abnormal buildup of cholesterol in the brain probably also contributes to the death of nerve cells. The loss of these cells results in the deterioration of nervous system functions (neurodegeneration) and causes the movement problems, weakness, and other signs and symptoms characteristic of spastic paraplegia type 5A. "
336,CYP11B1 ,cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily B member 1,"The CYP11B1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 11-beta-hydroxylase. This enzyme is found in the adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys. The 11-beta-hydroxylase enzyme is a member of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. These enzymes are involved in the formation and breakdown of various molecules within cells.The 11-beta-hydroxylase enzyme helps produce hormones called cortisol and corticosterone. Specifically, the enzyme helps convert a molecule called 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol, and helps convert another molecule called 11-deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone. These processes are triggered by the release of a hormone called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain.Cortisol helps maintain blood sugar levels, protects the body from physical stress, and suppresses inflammation. Corticosterone is converted to the hormone aldosterone by the aldosterone synthase enzyme, which is produced from the nearby CYP11B2 gene. Aldosterone helps control blood pressure by maintaining proper salt and fluid levels in the body.","Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency More than 80 mutations in the CYP11B1 gene have been found to cause congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency, a disorder in which the adrenal glands produce excess male sex hormones (androgens). Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the 11-beta-hydroxylase enzyme and decrease the function of the enzyme. CYP11B1 gene mutations that severely reduce or eliminate the function of the enzyme typically result in the classic form of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency. Mutations that allow for some enzyme function usually result in the non-classic form of the disorder.Some mutations that cause the classic form of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency fuse sections of the CYP11B1 gene with sections of a nearby gene called CYP11B2. The added part of the CYP11B2 gene contains a section called a promoter region, which normally controls (regulates) production of the protein made by the CYP11B2 gene. As a result, the CYP11B1 gene is regulated by the CYP11B2 gene promoter region rather than its own promoter region. In addition, the fusion typically deletes parts of the CYP11B1 gene. These changes in the gene's regulation and structure diminish production of 11-beta-hydroxylase.Both types of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency interfere with the production of cortisol and corticosterone. The molecules that are used to form these hormones instead build up in the adrenal gland and are converted to androgens. The excess production of androgens leads to abnormalities of sexual development in people with CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency. A buildup of the molecule 11-deoxycorticosterone, the substance that 11-beta-hydroxylase converts to form corticosterone, increases salt retention, leading to high blood pressure (hypertension) in individuals with the classic form of CAH due to 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency. "
337,CYP11B2 ,cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily B member 2,"The CYP11B2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aldosterone synthase (previously known as corticosterone methyloxidase). This enzyme is found in the adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys. Aldosterone synthase is a member of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. These enzymes are involved in the formation and breakdown of various molecules within cells.Aldosterone synthase helps produce a hormone called aldosterone. Aldosterone helps control blood pressure by maintaining proper salt and fluid levels in the body. The aldosterone synthase enzyme is involved in a series of three chemical reactions that produce aldosterone from other (precursor) molecules: the conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone, the conversion of corticosterone to 18-hydroxycorticosterone, and the conversion of 18-hydroxycorticosterone to aldosterone.","Corticosterone methyloxidase deficiency At least 30 CYP11B2 gene mutations that cause corticosterone methyloxidase deficiency (also known as aldosterone synthase deficiency) have been identified. These mutations lead to insufficient production of aldosterone, which impairs the kidneys' ability to reabsorb salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) into the blood and release potassium in the urine. As a result, excessive amounts of salt in the form of charged atoms (ions) of sodium (Na+) and chlorine (Cl-) leave the body in the urine, while not enough potassium is released. The resulting imbalance of ions in the body underlies the signs and symptoms of this disorder, which include nausea, vomiting, dehydration, low blood pressure, extreme tiredness (fatigue), and muscle weakness. "
338,CYP17A1 ,cytochrome P450 family 17 subfamily A member 1,"The CYP17A1 gene provides instructions for making a member of the cytochrome P450 enzyme family. Like other cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP17A1 is involved in the formation (synthesis) of steroid hormones. This group of hormones includes sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogen, which are needed for normal sexual development and reproduction; mineralocorticoids, which help regulate the body's salt and water balance; and glucocorticoids, which are involved in maintaining blood sugar levels and regulating the body's response to stress.Steroid hormones are synthesized through a series of chemical reactions. The CYP17A1 enzyme performs two important reactions in this process. The enzyme has 17 alpha(α)-hydroxylase activity, converting pregnenalone to 17-hydroxypregnenolone and progesterone to 17-hydroxyprogesterone. These hormone precursors are further processed to produce glucocorticoids and sex hormones. CYP17A1 also has 17,20-lyase activity, which converts 17-hydroxypregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). This reaction is integral to the production of sex hormones.","17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency Dozens of mutations in the CYP17A1 gene have been found to cause 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency. This condition affects the function of certain hormone-producing glands, leading to high blood pressure (hypertension) and abnormal sexual development. Mutations associated with this condition reduce or eliminate both 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activity. Reduction of these activities leads to partial 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency, while total loss of these activities leads to the more severe form of the disorder known as complete 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency.Without 17α-hydroxylase activity, pregnenolone and progesterone are not converted to 17-hydroxypregnenolone or 17-hydroxyprogesterone, impairing production of glucocorticoids. Instead pregnenolone and progesterone are processed to form mineralocorticoids. An excess of these salt-regulating hormones leads to hypertension and low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia).A loss of 17,20-lyase activity impairs sex hormone production. In females, a lack of female sex hormones disrupts development of internal reproductive organs (the ovaries and uterus) and secondary sex characteristics, such as breasts and menstrual periods. In chromosomal males (individuals with an X and a Y chromosome), a lack of male sex hormones leads to abnormal development of external genitalia. Depending on the severity of the condition, these affected individuals can have abnormal male genitalia, genitalia that do not look clearly male or clearly female (ambiguous genitalia), or characteristically female genitalia. "
339,CYP19A1 ,cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A member 1,"The CYP19A1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aromatase. This enzyme converts a class of hormones called androgens, which are involved in male sexual development, to different forms of the female sex hormone estrogen.In cells, aromatase is found in a structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein production, processing, and transport. The activity (expression) of aromatase varies among different cell types depending on the cells' need for estrogen. In females, aromatase is most active in the ovaries, where it guides sexual development. In males, aromatase is most active in fat (adipose) tissue. In both males and females, estrogen plays a role in regulating bone growth and blood sugar levels. During fetal development, aromatase converts androgens to estrogens in the placenta, which is the link between the mother's blood supply and the fetus. This conversion in the placenta prevents androgens from directing sexual development in female fetuses. After birth, the conversion of androgens to estrogens takes place in multiple tissues.","Aromatase deficiency More than 20 mutations in the CYP19A1 gene have been found to cause aromatase deficiency. This condition is characterized by reduced levels of estrogen and increased levels of androgens. These abnormal hormone levels lead to impaired sexual development in affected females and unusual bone growth, insulin resistance, and other signs and symptoms in both males and females with the condition. CYP19A1 gene mutations that cause aromatase deficiency decrease or eliminate aromatase activity. A lack of aromatase function results in an inability to convert androgens to estrogens before birth and throughout life. As a result, there is a decrease in estrogen production and an increase in the levels of androgens, including testosterone. In women who are pregnant with an affected fetus, excess androgens in the placenta pass into the woman's bloodstream, and may cause her to have temporary signs and symptoms of aromatase deficiency. "
340,CYP21A2 ,cytochrome P450 family 21 subfamily A member 2,"The CYP21A2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase, which is part of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in many processes in the body, such as assisting with reactions that break down drugs and helping to produce cholesterol, certain hormones, and fats (lipids).The 21-hydroxylase enzyme is found in the adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys and produce a variety of hormones that regulate many essential functions in the body. 21-hydroxylase plays a role in producing hormones called cortisol and aldosterone. Cortisol helps maintain blood sugar levels, protects the body from stress, and suppresses inflammation. Aldosterone is sometimes called the salt-retaining hormone because it regulates the amount of salt retained by the kidneys. The retention of salt affects fluid levels in the body and blood pressure.","21-hydroxylase deficiency More than 100 mutations in the CYP21A2 gene have been found to cause 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Some of these mutations result from an exchange of genetic material between the CYP21A2 gene and a similar but nonfunctional piece of DNA called a pseudogene, which is located very close to the CYP21A2 gene on chromosome 6. This type of DNA exchange is called a gene conversion. The genetic material from the pseudogene contains errors that, when introduced into the CYP21A2 gene, disrupt the way the gene's instructions are used to make a protein. Other mutations that cause 21-hydroxylase deficiency change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the 21-hydroxylase enzyme or delete or insert pieces of DNA in the CYP21A2 gene.Researchers have described three forms of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Individuals with a form of the disorder called the salt-wasting type have CYP21A2 mutations that result in a completely nonfunctional enzyme. People with the simple virilizing type of this condition have CYP21A2 gene mutations that allow the production of low levels of functional enzyme. Individuals with the non-classic type of this disorder have CYP21A2 mutations that result in the production of reduced amounts of the enzyme, but more enzyme than any of the other types. All types of 21-hydroxylase deficiency interfere with the production of cortisol and aldosterone. The substances that are usually used to form these hormones instead build up in the adrenal glands and are converted to androgens, which are male sex hormones. The excess production of androgens leads to abnormalities of sexual development in people with 21-hydroxylase deficiency. "
341,CYP24A1 ,cytochrome P450 family 24 subfamily A member 1,"The CYP24A1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 24-hydroxylase. This enzyme helps control the amount of active vitamin D available in the body. When active, vitamin D is involved in maintaining the proper balance of several minerals in the body, including calcium and phosphate, which are essential for the normal formation of bones and teeth. One of vitamin D's major roles is to control the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the intestines into the bloodstream. Vitamin D is also involved in several processes in addition to bone and tooth formation.The 24-hydroxylase enzyme breaks down the active form of vitamin D, called 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or calcitriol, to an inactive form when the vitamin is no longer needed. The enzyme also breaks down 25-hydroxyvitamin D (also known as calcidiol), which is the form of vitamin D that is stored in the body.","Idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia More than 20 mutations in the CYP24A1 gene have been found to cause a type of idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia called infantile hypercalcemia 1, which is characterized by high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia) and urine (hypercalciuria) and deposits of calcium in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis). The hypercalcemia typically causes vomiting, poor feeding, and an inability to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive) in infancy, although some affected individuals do not develop signs and symptoms of the condition until adulthood. Features in affected adults, whether they had symptoms in infancy or not, typically include hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and kidney stones (nephrolithiasis), although they may not cause any obvious health problems.The CYP24A1 gene mutations that cause infantile hypercalcemia 1 reduce or eliminate the activity of the 24-hydroxylase enzyme. A shortage of this enzyme's function impairs the breakdown of calcitriol. The resulting excess of calcitriol increases calcium absorption into the bloodstream, causing hypercalcemia. Dysregulation of calcium absorption in the kidneys leads to hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and nephrolithiasis. "
342,CYP27A1 ,cytochrome P450 family 27 subfamily A member 1,"The CYP27A1 gene is a member of the cytochrome P450 gene family. Enzymes produced from the cytochrome P450 genes are involved in the formation and breakdown of various molecules and chemicals within cells. The CYP27A1 gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called sterol 27-hydroxylase. This enzyme is located in the energy-producing centers of cells (mitochondria), where it is involved in the pathway that breaks down cholesterol to form acids used to digest fats (bile acids). Specifically, sterol 27-hydroxylase breaks down cholesterol to form a bile acid called chenodeoxycholic acid. The formation of bile acids from cholesterol is the body's main pathway for cholesterol removal. Sterol 27-hydroxylase plays a key role in maintaining normal cholesterol levels in the body.","Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis At least 90 mutations that cause cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis have been identified in the CYP27A1 gene. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a disorder characterized by abnormal storage of fats (lipids) in many areas of the body. Most CYP27A1 gene mutations change one protein building block (amino acid) in the sterol 27-hydroxylase enzyme. The most common mutation changes the amino acid arginine to the amino acid cysteine at position 362 in the protein (written as Arg362Cys or R362C). Changes in amino acids typically disrupt the normal function of the protein and impair its ability to help form chenodeoxycholic acid. Other mutations cause no functional enzyme to be made. As a result, other molecules are formed by an alternative pathway. A molecule called cholestanol, which is similar to cholesterol, is produced and accumulates in blood and tissues. Cholesterol also accumulates in tissues, but levels in blood are typically normal. The accumulation of cholesterol and cholestanol throughout the body's tissues causes the signs and symptoms of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. "
343,CYP27B1 ,cytochrome P450 family 27 subfamily B member 1,"The CYP27B1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 1-alpha-hydroxylase (1α-hydroxylase). This enzyme carries out the second of two reactions to convert vitamin D to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, also known as calcitriol. Vitamin D can be acquired from foods in the diet or can be made in the body with the help of sunlight exposure. When active, this vitamin is involved in maintaining the proper balance of several minerals in the body, including calcium and phosphate, which are essential for the normal formation of bones and teeth. One of vitamin D's major roles is to control the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the intestines into the bloodstream. Vitamin D is also involved in several processes unrelated to bone and tooth formation.","Vitamin D-dependent rickets At least 70 mutations in the CYP27B1 gene have been found to cause vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1A (VDDR1A), also known as vitamin D 1α-hydroxylase deficiency. This disorder of bone development is characterized by low levels of calcium (hypocalcemia) and phosphate (hypophosphatemia) in the blood, which lead to soft, weak bones that are prone to fracture. A common feature of this condition is abnormally curved (bowed) legs.The CYP27B1 gene mutations that cause this condition reduce or eliminate the function of 1α-hydroxylase. As a result, vitamin D does not get converted to its active form and cannot control mineral absorption. The resulting reduction in calcium and phosphate absorption from the intestines into the blood means there is less of these minerals to be deposited in developing bones (bone mineralization), which leads to soft, weak bones and other features of VDDR1A. Hypocalcemia also causes muscle weakness and seizures in some affected individuals. "
344,D2HGDH ,D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase,"The D2HGDH gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase. This enzyme is found in mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers within cells. Within mitochondria, the enzyme participates in reactions that produce energy for cell activities. Specifically, D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase converts a compound called D-2-hydroxyglutarate to another compound called 2-ketoglutarate. A series of additional enzymes further process 2-ketoglutarate to produce energy.","2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria Researchers have identified more than 30 D2HGDH gene mutations that cause a type of 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria known as D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D-2-HGA) type I. This condition has a variety of signs and symptoms that result primarily from progressive damage to the brain beginning early in life.Some D2HGDH gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase enzyme, which likely impairs its function. Other mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the enzyme. With a shortage of functional enzyme, D-2-hydroxyglutarate is not broken down but instead builds up in cells. At high levels, this compound can damage cells and lead to cell death. Brain cells appear to be the most vulnerable to the toxic effects of this compound, which may explain why the signs and symptoms of D-2-HGA type I primarily involve the brain. "
345,DARS1 ,aspartyl-tRNA synthetase,"The DARS1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. This enzyme is found in all cell types and plays an important role in the production (synthesis) of proteins. During protein synthesis, building blocks (amino acids) are connected together in a specific order, creating a chain of amino acids. A type of RNA called transfer RNA (tRNA) carries a specific amino acid to the growing chain. Enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, including aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, attach a particular amino acid to a specific tRNA. Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase attaches the amino acid aspartate to the correct tRNA, which helps ensure that aspartate is added at the proper place in proteins.In addition to its role in protein synthesis, aspartyl-tRNA synthetase may have other functions that are not fully understood.","Hypomyelination with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and leg spasticity At least 16 mutations in the DARS1 gene have been found to cause a condition called hypomyelination with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and leg spasticity (HBSL). This condition is characterized by abnormalities of the nervous system's white matter, usually involving particular regions of the spinal cord and brainstem (the region of the brain that connects to the spinal cord). The white matter consists of nerve fibers covered by a fatty substance called myelin, which insulates the fibers and promotes the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. In HBSL, the nervous system has a reduced ability to form myelin (hypomyelination). Affected individuals develop muscle stiffness (spasticity) in the legs that worsens over time and impairs walking.Most of the mutations in the DARS1 gene change single amino acids in the aspartyl-tRNA synthetase enzyme. These alterations occur in a region of the enzyme called the active site, where aspartate and the tRNA come together so the amino acid can be transferred. The altered enzyme has difficulty adding the amino acid to the tRNA, which in turn hinders the addition of aspartate to proteins. It is unclear how the gene mutations lead to the signs and symptoms of HBSL. Researchers do not understand why reduced activity of aspartyl-tRNA synthetase affects myelination or why specific parts of the brainstem and spinal cord are involved. "
346,DARS2 ,"aspartyl-tRNA synthetase 2, mitochondrial","The DARS2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. This enzyme is important in the production (synthesis) of proteins in cellular structures called mitochondria, the energy-producing centers in cells. While most protein synthesis occurs in the fluid surrounding the nucleus (cytoplasm), some proteins are synthesized in the mitochondria.During protein synthesis, in either the mitochondria or the cytoplasm, a type of RNA called transfer RNA (tRNA) helps assemble protein building blocks (amino acids) into a chain that forms the protein. Each tRNA carries a specific amino acid to the growing chain. Enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, including mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, attach a particular amino acid to a specific tRNA. Mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase attaches the amino acid aspartic acid to the correct tRNA, which helps ensure that aspartic acid is added at the proper place in the mitochondrial protein.","Leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation At least 25 mutations in the DARS2 gene have been identified in people with leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (LBSL), a condition that affects the brain and spinal cord and causes difficulty walking. The most common mutation that causes this condition disrupts the way genetic information is pieced together to make a blueprint for producing the mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase enzyme. Most copies of the blueprint are pieced together incorrectly, which prevents the enzyme from being produced. However, some copies are pieced together correctly, and a small amount of normal enzyme is made. Other mutations change single amino acids in the enzyme. This type of mutation results in decreased mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase enzyme activity. With reduced activity, the enzyme has difficulty adding aspartic acid to the tRNA, which hinders the addition of this amino acid to mitochondrial proteins.It is unclear how the gene mutations lead to the signs and symptoms of LBSL. Researchers do not understand why reduced activity of mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase specifically affects certain parts of the brain and spinal cord. "
347,DBH ,dopamine beta-hydroxylase,"The DBH gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme dopamine beta (β)-hydroxylase. This enzyme converts dopamine to norepinephrine, both of which are chemical messengers (neurotransmitters) that transmit signals between nerve cells. Norepinephrine plays an important role in the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary body processes such as the regulation of blood pressure and body temperature.","Dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency At least six mutations in the DBH gene have been found to cause dopamine β-hydroxylase deficiency. The most common mutation (usually written as IVS1+2T>C) interferes with the normal processing of dopamine β-hydroxylase. As a result of this mutation, an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the enzyme is produced. A lack of functional dopamine β-hydroxylase leads to a shortage of norepinephrine, which causes difficulty with regulating blood pressure and other autonomic nervous system problems seen in dopamine β-hydroxylase deficiency. "
348,DBT ,dihydrolipoamide branched chain transacylase E2,"The DBT gene provides instructions for making part of a group of enzymes called the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD) enzyme complex. Specifically, the protein produced from the DBT gene forms a critical piece of the enzyme complex called the E2 component.The BCKD enzyme complex is responsible for one step in the normal breakdown of three protein building blocks (amino acids). These amino acids—leucine, isoleucine, and valine—are obtained from the diet. They are present in many kinds of food, particularly protein-rich foods such as milk, meat, and eggs. The BCKD enzyme complex is active in mitochondria, which are specialized structures inside cells that serve as energy-producing centers. The breakdown of leucine, isoleucine, and valine produces molecules that can be used for energy.","Maple syrup urine disease More than 70 mutations in the DBT gene have been identified in people with maple syrup urine disease, most often in individuals with mild variants of the disorder. These variant forms become apparent later in infancy or childhood, and they lead to delayed development and other health problems if not treated.Mutations in the DBT gene include changes in single DNA building blocks (base pairs) and insertions or deletions of a small amount of DNA in the DBT gene. These changes disrupt the normal function of the E2 component, preventing the BCKD enzyme complex from effectively breaking down leucine, isoleucine, and valine. As a result, these amino acids and their byproducts build up in the body. This accumulation is toxic to cells and tissues, particularly in the nervous system. The buildup of these substances can lead to developmental delay and the other health problems associated with maple syrup urine disease. "
349,DCAF17 ,DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 17,"The DCAF17 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. The gene is active (expressed) in several organs and tissues in the body, including the brain, skin, and liver. Within cells, the protein produced from this gene is found in the nucleolus, which is a small region inside the nucleus where cell structures called ribosomes are assembled. It is not clear whether the DCAF17 protein plays a role in this process.","Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome At least 11 DCAF17 gene mutations have been identified in people with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome, a disorder that affects the body's network of hormone-producing glands (the endocrine system) and the nervous system. This condition is characterized by delayed or absent puberty, hair loss, abnormal movements, hearing loss, and intellectual disability.Most of the DCAF17 gene mutations that cause Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome result in a protein that is abnormally short and breaks down quickly or whose usual function is impaired. Loss of DCAF17 protein function likely accounts for the features of Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome, although it is unclear how a shortage of this protein leads to hormone abnormalities and the other signs and symptoms of this condition. "
350,DCC ,DCC netrin 1 receptor,"The DCC gene provides instructions for making a protein called the netrin-1 receptor, which is involved in the development of the nervous system. This receptor has three major parts: an extracellular region that sticks out from the surface of the cell, a transmembrane region that anchors the receptor to the cell membrane, and an intracellular region that transmits signals to the interior of the cell. The extracellular region attaches (binds) to a substance (its ligand) called netrin-1, fitting together like a lock and its key. The binding of netrin-1 triggers signaling via the intracellular region of the receptor that helps direct the growth of specialized nerve cell extensions called axons. Axons transmit nerve impulses that signal muscle movement. Normally, movement signals from each half of the brain control muscles on the opposite side of the body. Binding of netrin-1 to its receptor inhibits axons from developing in ways that would carry movement signals from each half of the brain to the same side of the body.The netrin-1 receptor is also thought to act as a dependence receptor, which means it has different functions in the presence or absence of its ligand. In the case of the netrin-1 receptor, binding to its ligand triggers signaling related to nervous system development, as described above. When not bound to netrin-1, the netrin-1 receptor acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it keeps cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way. Studies suggest that when the netrin-1 receptor is not bound to netrin-1, it triggers cell death (apoptosis).","Congenital mirror movement disorder At least 11 DCC gene mutations have been identified in people with congenital mirror movement disorder, a condition in which intentional movements of one side of the body are mirrored by involuntary movements of the other side. These mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the netrin-1 receptor or introduce a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the protein, resulting in an impaired or missing protein. Insufficient functional netrin-1 receptor protein impairs control of axon growth during nervous system development. As a result, movement signals from each half of the brain are abnormally transmitted to both sides of the body, leading to mirror movements. "
351,DCN ,decorin,"The DCN gene provides instructions for making a protein called decorin. This protein is a component of the extracellular matrix, which is the intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. Decorin is found in the extracellular matrix of a variety of connective tissues, including skin, tendon, bone, and cartilage. Connective tissues support the body's joints and organs.Decorin is involved in the organization of proteins called collagens. Collagens strengthen and support connective tissues throughout the body. Collagens also play an important role in the cornea, which is the clear outer covering of the eye. Bundles of collagen called fibrils must be strictly organized for the cornea to be transparent. Decorin ensures that these collagen fibrils are uniformly sized and regularly spaced.Researchers have proposed several additional functions for decorin. This protein likely helps regulate cell growth and division, the attachment of cells to one another (cell adhesion), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). Studies suggest that decorin plays a role in the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), wound healing, bone development, inflammation, and preventing the growth of cancerous tumors. Decorin also regulates the activity of several growth factors, including transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ). These growth factors control a diverse range of processes important for cell growth.","Congenital stromal corneal dystrophy Several mutations in the DCN gene have been identified in families with congenital stromal corneal dystrophy. Each of the known mutations leads to the production of an abnormally short version of the decorin protein. This abnormal protein interferes with the organization of collagen fibrils in the cornea. As poorly arranged collagen fibrils accumulate, the cornea becomes cloudy. These corneal changes lead to a loss of sharp vision (reduced visual acuity) and other eye abnormalities related to visual impairment. "
352,DCTN1 ,dynactin subunit 1,"The DCTN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called dynactin-1. At least two different versions of this protein are produced in cells. The two versions differ in size; the larger version is called p150-glued, and the smaller version is called p135.Both versions of the dynactin-1 protein interact with several other proteins to form a group (a complex) of proteins called dynactin. The p150-glued version of dynactin-1 is the largest component (subunit) of the dynactin complex. This complex plays a critical role in cell division and the transport of materials within cells. To carry out these roles, the complex's p150-glued subunit attaches (binds) to a protein called dynein, which acts as a motor, and also binds to a track-like system of small tubes called microtubules. The dynactin complex, dynein, and microtubules work together like a conveyer belt to move materials within cells.Researchers believe that the dynactin complex is particularly important for the proper function of axons, which are specialized extensions of nerve cells (neurons). Axons transmit impulses from nerve to nerve and from nerves to muscles. Axons can be quite long; some are more than 3 feet in length. The dynactin complex is a critical part of a rapid transport system that supplies axons with materials to keep them healthy and functioning efficiently.","Perry syndrome At least five mutations in the DCTN1 gene have been found to cause Perry syndrome. This progressive brain disease is characterized by a pattern of movement abnormalities known as parkinsonism, psychiatric changes, weight loss, and abnormally slow breathing (hypoventilation).Most of the mutations that cause Perry syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the dynactin-1 protein. These genetic changes impair the ability of the p150-glued version of dynactin-1 to bind to the dynactin complex and to microtubules. An incomplete dynactin complex has a reduced ability to transport materials within cells. Slow or abnormal transport of materials needed for the normal function of neurons causes these cells to malfunction and ultimately die. A gradual loss of neurons in areas of the brain that regulate movement, emotion, and breathing underlies the signs and symptoms of Perry syndrome. "
353,DCX ,doublecortin,"The DCX gene provides instructions for producing a protein called doublecortin. This protein is involved in the movement of nerve cells (neurons) to their proper locations in the developing brain, a process called neuronal migration. Doublecortin attaches (binds) to microtubules, which are rigid, hollow fibers that make up the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton). The binding of doublecortin promotes the stability of microtubules. Microtubules help propel neurons by forming scaffolding within the cell that elongates in a specific direction, altering the cytoskeleton and moving the neuron.","Isolated lissencephaly sequence More than 70 mutations in the DCX gene have been found to cause isolated lissencephaly sequence (ILS). This condition is characterized by abnormal brain development that results in the brain having a smooth surface (lissencephaly) instead of its normal folds and grooves. Individuals with ILS have severe neurological problems, including severe intellectual disability and recurrent seizures (epilepsy) that begin in infancy. Most of the DCX gene mutations that cause ILS change a single protein building block (amino acid) in doublecortin and usually result in a protein with little or no function. A lack of normal doublecortin affects the stability and organization of microtubules, impairing their ability to move neurons. Neurons in the developing brain are particularly affected, resulting in the neurological problems associated with ILS. "
354,DCXR ,dicarbonyl and L-xylulose reductase,"The DCXR gene provides instructions for making a protein called dicarbonyl and L-xylulose reductase (DCXR), which plays multiple roles in the body. One of its functions is to perform a chemical reaction that converts a sugar called L-xylulose to a molecule called xylitol. This reaction is one step in a process by which the body can use sugars for energy. There are two versions of L-xylulose reductase in the body, known as the major isoform and the minor isoform. The DCXR gene provides instructions for making the major isoform, which converts L-xylulose more efficiently than the minor isoform. It is unclear if the minor isoform is produced from the DCXR gene or another gene.Another function of the DCXR protein is to break down toxic compounds called alpha-dicarbonyl compounds. These compounds, which are byproducts of certain cellular processes or are found in foods in the diet, must be broken down so they do not damage cells.The DCXR protein is also one of several proteins that get attached to the surface of sperm cells as they mature. DCXR is involved in the interaction of a sperm cell with an egg cell during fertilization.","Essential pentosuria At least two mutations in the DCXR gene cause a condition called essential pentosuria, which is found almost exclusively in individuals with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Affected individuals have high levels of L-xylulose in their urine, but they have no associated health problems. The gene mutations involved in this condition lead to the production of altered DCXR proteins that are quickly broken down. Without this protein, L-xylulose is not efficiently converted to xylitol, and the excess sugar is released in the urine. Only the major isoform of L-xylulose reductase is affected by these mutations, but the minor isoform cannot compensate for the loss of DCXR's function in breaking down L-xylulose. It is thought that other processes are able to break down toxic alpha-dicarbonyl compounds, likely accounting for the lack of symptoms in people with essential pentosuria.Males with essential pentosuria appear to have normal reproductive function, despite studies that show that a shortage of DCXR protein attached to sperm cells can be associated with the inability to have biological children (infertility). "
355,DDC ,dopa decarboxylase,"The DDC gene provides instructions for making the aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme, which is important in the brain and nervous system. This enzyme takes part in the pathway that produces dopamine and serotonin, which are chemical messengers that transmit signals between nerve cells (neurotransmitters).Dopamine is produced from the protein building block (amino acid) tyrosine, and serotonin is produced from the amino acid tryptophan. Both neurotransmitters are produced in two-step processes. First, other enzymes control the reactions that convert tyrosine to L-dopa, and tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan. The AADC enzyme then converts L-dopa and 5-hydroxytryptophan to dopamine and serotonin, respectively. To do this, it removes a molecular structure called a carboxyl group, consisting of a carbon atom, two oxygen atoms, and a hydrogen atom.","Aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency Mutations in the DDC gene result in reduced activity of the AADC enzyme. Without enough of this enzyme, nerve cells produce less dopamine and serotonin. Dopamine and serotonin are necessary for normal nervous system function, and changes in the levels of these neurotransmitters contribute to the developmental delay, intellectual disability, abnormal movements, and autonomic dysfunction seen in people with AADC deficiency. "
356,DDX11 ,DEAD/H-box helicase 11,"The DDX11 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called ChlR1, which functions as a helicase. Helicases are enzymes that attach (bind) to DNA and temporarily unwind the two spiral strands (double helix) of the DNA molecule so it can be copied (replicated) in preparation for cell division. ChlR1 is also involved in repairing any errors that are made when DNA is copied. In addition, ChlR1 is involved in other processes leading up to cell division. After replication, the DNA from each chromosome is arranged into two identical structures, called sister chromatids, which the ChlR1 enzyme helps to keep together until they are ready to separate into individual cells. This enzyme also ensures proper separation of chromatids during cell division. By helping repair errors in DNA and ensuring proper DNA replication, the ChlR1 enzyme plays a role in maintaining the stability of a cell's genetic information.","Warsaw breakage syndrome At least three mutations in the DDX11 gene have been found to cause Warsaw breakage syndrome. This condition causes multiple abnormalities that may include impaired growth, distinctive facial features, hearing loss, and heart malformations. The mutations that cause Warsaw breakage syndrome severely reduce or completely eliminate ChlR1 enzyme activity. As a result, the enzyme cannot bind to DNA and cannot unwind the DNA strands to help with DNA replication and repair. A lack of functional ChlR1 impairs cell division and leads to an accumulation of DNA damage. This DNA damage can appear as breaks in the DNA, giving the condition its name. It is unclear how these problems in DNA maintenance lead to the specific abnormalities characteristic of Warsaw breakage syndrome. "
357,DEPDC5 ,DEP domain containing 5,"The DEPDC5 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is one piece of a group of proteins (complex) called GATOR1. This complex is found in cells throughout the body, where it regulates a signaling pathway called the mTOR pathway. The mTOR pathway is involved in cell growth and division (proliferation), the survival of cells, and the creation (synthesis) of new proteins. The role of the GATOR1 complex is to block this pathway by inhibiting (stopping) the activity of a complex called mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) that is integral to the mTOR pathway.In the brain, the mTOR pathway regulates many processes, including the growth and development of nerve cells and their ability to change and adapt over time (plasticity).","Familial focal epilepsy with variable foci More than 80 mutations in the DEPDC5 gene have been found to cause familial focal epilepsy with variable foci (FFEVF), which is an uncommon form of recurrent seizures (epilepsy) that runs in families. Affected individuals experience focal seizures, which are seizures that do not cause a loss of consciousness. Most of the DEPDC5 gene mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short protein that is quickly broken down. As a result, formation of normal GATOR1 complex is reduced, leading to overactivity of mTORC1 and excessive signaling of the mTOR pathway. It is not clear how an abnormally active mTOR pathway leads to the focal seizures of FFEVF. Research suggests that increased mTOR pathway signaling in the brain leads to changes in the connections between nerve cells (synapses) and increased activation (excitation) of nerve cells, which can cause seizures.For unknown reasons, some people with FFEVF caused by a DEPDC5 gene mutation never develop the condition, a situation known as reduced penetrance. It is estimated that 60 percent of individuals with DEPDC5 gene mutations go on to develop FFEVF. "
358,DES ,desmin,"The DES gene provides instructions for making a protein called desmin. Desmin is found in heart (cardiac) muscle and muscles used for movement (skeletal muscle). Within muscle fibers, desmin proteins are important to help maintain the structure of sarcomeres, which are necessary for muscles to tense (contract). The desmin proteins surround rod-like structures called Z-discs that are located within the sarcomere. Desmin connects the Z-discs to one another, linking neighboring sarcomeres and forming myofibrils, the basic unit of muscle fibers. The connection of sarcomeres to each other to form myofibrils is essential for maintaining muscle fiber strength during repeated cycles of contraction and relaxation.","Myofibrillar myopathy More than 40 mutations in the DES gene have been found to cause myofibrillar myopathy. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in desmin. Mutated desmin proteins cluster together with other muscle proteins in the sarcomere to form clumps (aggregates). The aggregates prevent these proteins from functioning normally. A dysfunctional desmin protein cannot properly interact with Z-discs, leading to abnormalities of sarcomere structure and problems with the formation of myofibrils. DES gene mutations that cause myofibrillar myopathy impair the function of muscle fibers, causing weakness and the other features of this condition. People with DES gene mutations are more likely to have a weakened heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) than people with myofibrillar myopathy caused by mutations in other genes. In some cases, cardiomyopathy is the first symptom of this condition. "
359,DGUOK ,deoxyguanosine kinase,"The DGUOK gene provides instructions for making the enzyme deoxyguanosine kinase. This enzyme plays a critical role in mitochondria, which are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Mitochondria each contain a small amount of DNA, known as mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA, which is essential for the normal function of these structures. Deoxyguanosine kinase is involved in producing and maintaining the building blocks of mitochondrial DNA.","Deoxyguanosine kinase deficiency Approximately 40 mutations in the DGUOK gene have been identified in people with deoxyguanosine kinase deficiency. Some of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the deoxyguanosine kinase enzyme. Other mutations result in an abnormally shortened, nonfunctional enzyme or cause the enzyme to be pieced together incorrectly.Mutations in the DGUOK gene reduce or eliminate the activity of the deoxyguanosine kinase enzyme. Reduced enzyme activity leads to problems with the production and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA. A reduction in the amount of mitochondrial DNA (known as mitochondrial DNA depletion) impairs mitochondrial function in many of the body's cells and tissues. These problems lead to the neurological and liver dysfunction associated with deoxyguanosine kinase deficiency. "
360,DHCR7 ,7-dehydrocholesterol reductase,"The DHCR7 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase. This enzyme is responsible for the final step in cholesterol production in many types of cells. Specifically, 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase converts a molecule called 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol.Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is produced in the body and obtained from foods that come from animals (particularly egg yolks, meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products). It has important functions both before and after birth. Cholesterol plays a critical role in embryonic development by interacting with signaling proteins that control early development of the brain, limbs, genital tract, and other structures. It is also a structural component of cell membranes and myelin, the fatty covering that insulates nerve cells. Additionally, cholesterol is used to make certain hormones and is important for the production of acids used in digestion (bile acids).","Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome More than 200 mutations that cause Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome have been identified in the DHCR7 gene. Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is a developmental disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, small head size (microcephaly), intellectual disability or learning problems, and behavioral problems. The most common mutation, which is written as IVS8-1G>C, alters a single DNA building block (nucleotide) in the DHCR7 gene. This change interferes with the normal processing of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, resulting in an abnormally short, nonfunctional enzyme.Most of the known DHCR7 mutations change single amino acids in 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase. These mutations reduce the ability of this enzyme to convert 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol. Other mutations insert or delete nucleotides in the DHCR7 gene or lead to the production of an abnormally short enzyme; these mutations eliminate the activity of the enzyme. Without functional 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, cells are unable to produce enough cholesterol. In addition, toxic byproducts of cholesterol production (such as 7-dehydrocholesterol) can build up in the blood and other tissues. The combination of low cholesterol levels and an accumulation of harmful substances likely disrupts the growth and development of many body systems. It is not completely understood, however, how either abnormality leads to the specific features of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome. "
361,DHCR24 ,24-dehydrocholesterol reductase,"The DHCR24 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase. This enzyme is involved in multiple pathways that produce cholesterol. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that can be obtained from foods that come from animals (particularly egg yolks, meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products). It can also be produced in various tissues in the body. For example, the brain cannot access the cholesterol that comes from food, so brain cells must produce their own. In one pathway, 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase is involved in the final step of cholesterol production (synthesis), converting the fat desmosterol into cholesterol. In a different pathway, 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase converts the fat lanosterol into another fat called 24,25-dihydrolanosterol. The end product of both of these pathways is cholesterol.Cholesterol is necessary for normal embryonic development and has important functions both before and after birth. Cholesterol is an important component of cell membranes and the fatty protective covering that insulates nerves (myelin). Cholesterol also attaches (binds) to certain proteins to turn on (activate) the hedgehog signaling pathway, which is critical for normal development of many parts of the body before birth. Additionally, cholesterol plays a role in the production of certain hormones and digestive acids.","Desmosterolosis At least seven mutations in the DHCR24 gene have been found to cause desmosterolosis. Desmosterolosis is a condition that is characterized by neurological problems, such as brain abnormalities and developmental delay, and can also include other signs and symptoms. The mutations that cause this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase enzyme. As a result, enzyme activity is reduced and cholesterol production is decreased. Because the brain relies solely on cellular production for cholesterol, it is most severely affected. Without adequate cholesterol, cell membranes are not formed properly and nerve cells are not protected by myelin, leading to the death of these cells. In addition, a decrease in cholesterol production has more severe effects before birth than during other periods of development because of the rapid increase in cell number that takes place. Disruption of normal cell formation before birth likely accounts for the additional developmental abnormalities of desmosterolosis. "
362,DHH ,desert hedgehog,"The DHH gene provides instructions for making a member of the hedgehog protein family. Hedgehog proteins are important for early development in many parts of the body. The protein produced from the DHH gene is believed to be involved in male sexual development and in the formation of the perineurium, the protective membrane around each bundle of fibers within a nerve.","Swyer syndrome DHH gene mutations have been identified in a small number of people with Swyer syndrome, a condition affecting sexual development also known as 46,XY complete gonadal dysgenesis or 46,XY pure gonadal dysgenesis. Affected individuals have two mutated copies of the DHH gene in each cell.People usually have 46 chromosomes in each cell. Two of the 46 chromosomes, known as X and Y, are called sex chromosomes because they help determine whether a person will develop male or female sex characteristics. Girls and women typically have two X chromosomes (46,XX karyotype), and boys and men ordinarily have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (46,XY karyotype).Mutations in the DHH gene in people with Swyer syndrome affect the process of sexual differentiation, preventing affected individuals with a 46,XY karyotype from developing male gonads (testes) and causing them to develop female reproductive structures (a uterus and fallopian tubes). "
363,DHODH ,dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (quinone),"The DHODH gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. This enzyme is involved in producing pyrimidines, which are building blocks of DNA, its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as ATP and GTP that serve as energy sources in the cell. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase functions within mitochondria, the energy-producing centers within cells. Specifically, this enzyme converts a molecule called dihydroorotate to a molecule called orotic acid. In subsequent steps, other enzymes modify orotic acid to produce pyrimidines.","Miller syndrome At least 11 mutations in the DHODH gene have been found to cause Miller syndrome. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, which likely impairs the enzyme's ability to function normally. It is unclear exactly how DHODH gene mutations lead to the signs and symptoms of Miller syndrome. "
364,DICER1 ,"dicer 1, ribonuclease III","The DICER1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a role in regulating the activity (expression) of other genes. The Dicer protein aids in the production of a molecule called microRNA (miRNA). MicroRNAs are short lengths of RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. Dicer cuts (cleaves) precursor RNA molecules to produce miRNA.MicroRNAs control gene expression by blocking the process of protein production. In the first step of making a protein from a gene, another type of RNA called messenger RNA (mRNA) is formed and acts as the blueprint for protein production. MicroRNAs attach to specific mRNA molecules and stop the process by which protein is made. Sometimes, miRNAs break down the mRNA, which also blocks protein production. Through this role in regulating the expression of genes, Dicer is involved in many processes, including cell growth and division (proliferation) and the maturation of cells to take on specialized functions (differentiation).","DICER1 syndrome Mutations in the DICER1 gene cause DICER1 syndrome. People with this condition have an increased risk of developing many types of tumors, particularly certain tumors of the lungs (pleuropulmonary blastoma); kidneys (cystic nephroma); ovaries (Sertoli-Leydig tumors); and thyroid, a butterfly-shaped gland in the lower neck (multinodular goiter). Most of these mutations lead to an abnormally short Dicer protein that is likely unable to produce miRNA. Without regulation by miRNA, genes are expressed abnormally, which could cause cells to grow and divide uncontrollably and lead to tumor formation. "
365,DKC1 ,dyskerin pseudouridine synthase 1,"The DKC1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called dyskerin. This protein is involved in maintaining structures called telomeres, which are found at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres help protect chromosomes from abnormally sticking together or breaking down (degrading).In most cells, telomeres become progressively shorter as the cell divides. After a certain number of cell divisions, the telomeres become so short that they trigger the cell to stop dividing or to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis).Telomeres are maintained by two important protein complexes, telomerase and shelterin. Telomerase counteracts the shortening of telomeres by adding small repeated segments of DNA to the ends of chromosomes each time the cell divides. One component of telomerase, called hTR, provides a template for creating the repeated sequence of DNA that telomerase adds to the ends of chromosomes. The dyskerin protein attaches (binds) to hTR and helps stabilize the telomerase complex.In most types of cells, telomerase is either undetectable or active at very low levels. However, telomerase is highly active in cells that divide rapidly, such as cells that line the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, cells in bone marrow, and cells of the developing fetus. Telomerase allows these cells to divide many times without becoming damaged or undergoing apoptosis. Telomerase is also abnormally active in most cancer cells, which grow and divide without control or order.Dyskerin is also involved in the production of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a chemical cousin of DNA. Ribosomal RNA is required for assembling protein building blocks (amino acids) into functioning proteins.","Dyskeratosis congenita More than 40 mutations in the DKC1 gene have been identified in people with dyskeratosis congenita. This disorder is characterized by changes in skin coloring (pigmentation), white patches inside the mouth (oral leukoplakia), and abnormally formed fingernails and toenails (nail dystrophy). People with dyskeratosis congenita have an increased risk of developing several life-threatening conditions, including cancer and a progressive lung disease called pulmonary fibrosis. Many affected individuals also develop a serious condition called aplastic anemia, also known as bone marrow failure, which occurs when the bone marrow does not produce enough new blood cells.Most of the DKC1 gene mutations that cause dyskeratosis congenita change single amino acids in the dyskerin protein. Researchers believe that these changes probably interfere with the dyskerin protein's ability to bind to hTR, resulting in dysfunction of the telomerase complex.Impaired telomerase function prevents the normal maintenance of telomeres and leads to reduced telomere length. Cells that divide rapidly are especially vulnerable to the effects of shortened telomeres. As a result, people with dyskeratosis congenita may experience a variety of problems affecting quickly dividing cells in the body, such as cells of the nail beds, hair follicles, skin, lining of the mouth (oral mucosa), and bone marrow.Breakage and instability of chromosomes resulting from inadequate telomere maintenance may lead to genetic changes that allow cells to divide in an uncontrolled way, resulting in the development of cancer in some people with dyskeratosis congenita. "
366,DLAT ,dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase,"The DLAT gene provides instructions for making the E2 enzyme (also known as dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase), which is part of a large group of proteins called the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This complex comprises multiple copies of three enzymes, including E2, and several related proteins. The E2 enzyme is the core to which the other proteins attach to form the complex.The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex plays an important role in the pathways that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. This complex converts a molecule called pyruvate, which is formed from the breakdown of carbohydrates, into another molecule called acetyl-CoA. The E2 enzyme performs one part of this chemical reaction. The conversion of pyruvate is essential to begin the series of chemical reactions that produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source.","Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency At least two mutations in the DLAT gene have been identified in individuals with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency; mutation of the DLAT gene is a very rare cause of this condition. Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is characterized by a potentially life-threatening buildup of a chemical called lactic acid in the body (lactic acidosis), delayed development, and neurological problems.Mutations in the DLAT gene lead to an abnormal E2 enzyme and reduced activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, although the mechanism is unclear. With decreased activity of this complex, pyruvate builds up and is converted, in another chemical reaction, to lactic acid, causing lactic acidosis. In addition, the production of cellular energy is diminished. The brain, which is especially dependent on this form of energy, is severely affected, resulting in the neurological problems associated with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. "
367,DLD ,dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase,"The DLD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. This enzyme forms one part (subunit), called the E3 component, of several groups of enzymes that work together (enzyme complexes). These complexes are essential for the breakdown of certain molecules to produce energy in cells.Branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase, or BCKD, is one of the enzyme complexes that include dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. The BCKD enzyme complex performs one step in the breakdown of three protein building blocks (amino acids). These amino acids—leucine, isoleucine, and valine—are obtained from the diet. They are present in many kinds of food, particularly protein-rich foods such as milk, meat, and eggs. The breakdown of these amino acids produces molecules that can be used for energy.Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase is also part of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex. This enzyme complex plays an important role in the production of energy for cells. It converts a molecule called pyruvate, which is formed from the breakdown of carbohydrates, into another molecule called acetyl-CoA. Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase performs one step of this chemical reaction. The conversion of pyruvate is essential to begin the series of chemical reactions that ultimately produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source.Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase is part of a third enzyme complex involved in cellular energy production. This complex, called alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (αKGDH), converts a molecule called α-ketoglutarate to another molecule called succinyl-CoA. Further steps in this process generate ATP for cells to use as energy.","Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency At least 17 mutations in the DLD gene have been found to cause dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency. The signs and symptoms of this severe condition vary widely, but they most commonly include a potentially life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in the tissues (lactic acidosis), neurological problems, and liver disease.Most DLD mutations change single amino acids in dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, which prevents the BCKD, PDH, and αKGDH enzyme complexes from functioning normally. Impairment of BCKD function leads to a buildup of valine, isoleucine, and leucine and their byproducts in the body. This accumulation is toxic to cells and tissues, particularly in the nervous system, and contributes to neurological problems in people with dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency. A reduction in pyruvate dehydrogenase function results in buildup of pyruvate, which is converted in another chemical reaction to lactic acid, contributing to lactic acidosis in affected individuals. Impairment of αKGDH leads to the accumulation of alpha-ketoglutarate and likely also contributes to lactic acidosis. Reduced function of these three enzyme complexes also diminishes the production of cellular energy. The brain, which requires especially large amounts of energy, is severely affected, resulting in the neurological problems associated with dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency. Liver problems are likely also related to decreased energy production in cells. The degree of impairment of each complex contributes to the variability in the features of this condition. "
368,DLL3 ,delta like canonical Notch ligand 3,"The DLL3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control (regulate) the Notch pathway, an important pathway in embryonic development. The Notch pathway plays a critical role in the development of vertebrae. Specifically, the DLL3 protein and the Notch pathway are involved in separating future vertebrae from one another during early development, in a complex process called somite segmentation. Although the exact mechanism of somite segmentation is unclear, it appears to require the activity of several proteins in the Notch pathway, including the NOTCH1 protein, to be turned on and off (oscillate) in a specific pattern.The DLL3 protein regulates the activity of the NOTCH1 protein. The DLL3 protein attaches (binds) to the inactive NOTCH1 protein and isolates (sequesters) it or marks it to be broken down so that it cannot be activated.","Spondylocostal dysostosis At least 20 mutations in the DLL3 gene have been found to cause spondylocostal dysostosis type 1, the most common type of spondylocostal dysostosis. This condition is characterized by the abnormal development of bones in the spine and ribs. The known mutations in the DLL3 gene prevent the production of any protein or lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein. When the DLL3 protein is nonfunctional or absent, the NOTCH1 protein is abnormally active and does not oscillate, so somite segmentation does not occur properly. This results in the malformation and fusion of the bones of the spine and ribs seen in spondylocostal dysostosis type 1. "
369,DLL4 ,delta like canonical Notch ligand 4,"The DLL4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of a signaling pathway known as the Notch pathway, which is important for normal development of many tissues throughout the body. The DLL4 protein attaches to a receptor protein called Notch1, fitting together like a key into its lock. When a connection is made between DLL4 and Notch1, a series of signaling reactions is launched (the Notch pathway), affecting cell functions. In particular, signaling stimulated by DLL4 plays a role in development of blood vessels before birth and growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) throughout life.","Adams-Oliver syndrome At least nine DLL4 gene mutations have been found in people with Adams-Oliver syndrome, a condition characterized by areas of missing skin (aplasia cutis congenita), usually on the scalp, and malformations of the hands and feet. Some of these mutations lead to production of an abnormally short protein that is likely broken down quickly, causing a shortage of DLL4. Other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the DLL4 protein. These changes are thought to alter the structure of the protein, impairing its ability to function. Loss of DLL4 function may underlie blood vessel abnormalities in people with Adams-Oliver syndrome; however, some people with DLL4-related Adams-Oliver syndrome do not have these abnormalities. It is not clear how loss of DLL4 function leads to the scalp and limb abnormalities characteristic of the condition. Researchers suggest these features may be due to abnormal blood vessel development before birth. "
370,DMD ,dystrophin,"DMD, the largest known human gene, provides instructions for making a protein called dystrophin. This protein is located primarily in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles) and in heart (cardiac) muscle. Small amounts of dystrophin are present in nerve cells in the brain.In skeletal and cardiac muscles, dystrophin is part of a group of proteins (a protein complex) that work together to strengthen muscle fibers and protect them from injury as muscles contract and relax. The dystrophin complex acts as an anchor, connecting each muscle cell's structural framework (cytoskeleton) with the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell (extracellular matrix). The dystrophin complex may also play a role in cell signaling by interacting with proteins that send and receive chemical signals.Little is known about the function of dystrophin in nerve cells. Research suggests that the protein is important for the normal structure and function of synapses, which are specialized connections between nerve cells where cell-to-cell communication occurs.","Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy More than 2,000 mutations in the DMD gene have been identified in people with the Duchenne and Becker forms of muscular dystrophy. These conditions occur almost exclusively in males and are characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) and a heart condition called dilated cardiomyopathy. Most of the mutations that cause these conditions delete part of the DMD gene. Other mutations abnormally duplicate part of the gene or change a small number of DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the gene.Mutations that cause Becker muscular dystrophy, which typically has milder features and appears at a later age than Duchenne muscular dystrophy, usually lead to an abnormal version of dystrophin that retains some function. Mutations that cause the more severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy typically prevent any functional dystrophin from being produced.Skeletal and cardiac muscle cells without enough functional dystrophin become damaged as the muscles repeatedly contract and relax with use. The damaged cells weaken and die over time, causing the characteristic muscle weakness and heart problems seen in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy. "
371,DMPK ,DM1 protein kinase,"The DMPK gene provides instructions for making a protein called myotonic dystrophy protein kinase. Although the specific function of this protein is unknown, it appears to play an important role in muscle, heart, and brain cells. This protein may be involved in communication within cells. It also appears to regulate the production and function of important structures inside muscle cells by interacting with other proteins. For example, myotonic dystrophy protein kinase has been shown to turn off (inhibit) part of a muscle protein called myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase is an enzyme that plays a role in muscle tensing (contraction) and relaxation.One region of the DMPK gene contains a segment of three DNA building blocks (nucleotides) that is repeated multiple times. This sequence, which is written as CTG, is called a triplet or trinucleotide repeat. In most people, the number of CTG repeats in this gene ranges from 5 to 34.","Myotonic dystrophy Type 1 myotonic dystrophy results from a mutation in the DMPK gene known as a trinucleotide repeat expansion. This mutation increases the size of the repeated CTG segment in the DMPK gene. People with type 1 myotonic dystrophy have from 50 to 5,000 CTG repeats in most cells. The number of repeats may be even greater in certain types of cells, such as muscle cells.The mutated DMPK gene produces an altered version of messenger RNA, which is a molecular blueprint of the gene that is normally used to guide the production of proteins. Researchers have found that the altered messenger RNA traps proteins to form clumps within the cell. The clumps interfere with the production of many other proteins. These changes prevent muscle cells and cells in other tissues from functioning properly, leading to muscle weakness and the other features of type 1 myotonic dystrophy.The size of the trinucleotide repeat expansion is associated with the severity of signs and symptoms. People with the classic features of type 1 myotonic dystrophy, including muscle weakness and wasting beginning in adulthood, usually have between 100 and 1,000 CTG repeats. People born with the more severe congenital form of type 1 myotonic dystrophy tend to have a larger number of CTG repeats, often more than 2,000. This form of the condition is apparent in infancy and may involve life-threatening health problems.As the altered DMPK gene is passed from one generation to the next, the size of the CTG repeat expansion often increases in size. People with 35 to 49 CTG repeats have not been reported to develop type 1 myotonic dystrophy, but their children are at risk of having the disorder if the number of CTG repeats increases. Repeat lengths from 35 to 49 are called premutations. "
372,DNAH5 ,dynein axonemal heavy chain 5,"The DNAH5 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of a group (complex) of proteins called dynein. This complex functions within cell structures called cilia. Cilia are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. Coordinated back and forth movement of cilia can move the cell or the fluid surrounding the cell. Dynein produces the force needed for cilia to move.Within the core of cilia (the axoneme), dynein complexes are part of structures known as inner dynein arms (IDAs) or outer dynein arms (ODAs) depending on their location. Coordinated movement of the dynein arms causes the entire axoneme to bend back and forth. IDAs and ODAs have different combinations of protein components (subunits) that are classified by weight as heavy, intermediate, or light chains. The DNAH5 gene provides instructions for making heavy chain 5, which is found in ODAs. Other subunits are produced from different genes.","Primary ciliary dyskinesia More than 80 mutations in the DNAH5 gene have been found to cause primary ciliary dyskinesia, which is a condition characterized by respiratory tract infections, abnormal organ placement, and an inability to have children (infertility). DNAH5 gene mutations result in an absent or abnormal heavy chain 5. Without a normal version of this subunit, the ODAs cannot form properly and may be shortened or absent. As a result, cilia cannot produce the force needed to bend back and forth. Defective cilia lead to the features of primary ciliary dyskinesia. "
373,DNAI1 ,dynein axonemal intermediate chain 1,"The DNAI1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of a group (complex) of proteins called dynein. This complex functions within cell structures called cilia. Cilia are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. Coordinated back and forth movement of cilia can move the cell or the fluid surrounding the cell. Dynein produces the force needed for cilia to move.Within the core of cilia (the axoneme), dynein complexes are part of structures known as inner dynein arms (IDAs) and outer dynein arms (ODAs) depending on their location. Coordinated movement of the dynein arms causes the entire axoneme to bend back and forth. IDAs and ODAs have different combinations of protein components (subunits) that are classified by weight as heavy, intermediate, or light chains. The DNAI1 gene provides instructions for making intermediate chain 1, which is found in ODAs. Other subunits are produced from different genes.","Primary ciliary dyskinesia At least 21 mutations in the DNAI1 gene have been found to cause primary ciliary dyskinesia, which is a condition characterized by respiratory tract infections, abnormal organ placement, and an inability to have children (infertility). DNAI1 gene mutations result in an absent or abnormal intermediate chain 1. Without a normal version of this subunit, the ODAs cannot form properly and may be shortened or absent. As a result, cilia cannot produce the force needed to bend back and forth. Defective cilia lead to the features of primary ciliary dyskinesia. "
374,DNAJC5 ,DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C5,"The DNAJC5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cysteine string protein alpha (CSPα). This protein is found near nerve cells in the brain, where it plays a role in the transmission of nerve impulses. Specifically, CSPα is part of a group (complex) of proteins that is found on the membrane of sac-like structures called synaptic vesicles. Synaptic vesicles are found close to the ends of nerve cells and contain chemical messengers that transmit signals from one nerve cell to another. CSPα is involved in recycling proteins that are involved in nerve impulse transmission by re-folding misshapen proteins so that they can be used in additional transmissions.","CLN4 disease At least two mutations in the DNAJC5 gene have been found to cause CLN4 disease. CLN4 disease is an inherited disorder that primarily affects the nervous system. This condition usually begins in adulthood with problems with movement and intellectual function that worsen over time.One of the DNAJC5 gene mutations replaces the protein building block (amino acid) leucine with the amino acid arginine at position 115 in the CSPα protein (written as L115R). The other mutation deletes the amino acid leucine at position 116 in the protein (written as L116del). Affected individuals have one of these mutations in one copy of the DNAJC5 gene in each cell, which leads to the production of an altered protein that cannot associate with the membrane of synaptic vesicles. The resulting reduction in protein recycling leads to a shortage (deficiency) of functional proteins, which impairs the efficiency of nerve impulse transmission. The abnormal CSPα protein may also bind to the functional CSPα protein that is produced from the normal copy of the DNAJC5 gene and prevent it from associating with synaptic vesicles, further impairing impulse transmission. Without communication between nerve cells, neurological functions are impaired, contributing to the features of CLN4 disease.CLN4 disease is characterized by the accumulation of proteins and other substances in lysosomes, which are compartments in the cell that digest and recycle materials. These accumulations occur in cells throughout the body; however, nerve cells seem to be particularly vulnerable to their effects. The accumulations can cause cell damage leading to cell death. The progressive death of nerve cells in the brain and other tissues contributes to the decline of neurological function in CLN4 disease. However, it is unclear how mutations in the DNAJC5 gene are involved in the buildup of substances in lysosomes. "
375,DNAJC19 ,DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C19,"The DNAJC19 gene provides instructions for producing a protein found in structures called mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers of cells. While the exact function of the DNAJC19 protein is unclear, researchers believe that it helps transport other proteins into and out of mitochondria. The DNAJC19 protein may also assist in the proper assembly and disassembly of certain proteins.","Dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia syndrome At least two mutations in the DNAJC19 gene have been found to cause dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia (DCMA) syndrome. This condition is characterized by heart problems, movement difficulties, slow growth, genital abnormalities in males, and other features affecting multiple body systems. DNAJC19 gene mutations lead to the production of an abnormally shortened protein that likely has impaired function. In the Dariusleut Hutterite population of Canada, where DCMA syndrome is most frequently seen, the condition results from a mutation (written as IVS3-1G>C) that causes a disruption in the way the gene's instructions are used to make the DNAJC19 protein, resulting in deletion of part of the protein.Researchers speculate that a lack of functional DNAJC19 protein alters the transport of proteins into and out of the mitochondria. When too many or too few proteins move in and out of the mitochondria, energy production and mitochondrial survival can be reduced. Tissues that have high energy demands, such as the heart and the brain, are especially susceptible to decreases in cellular energy production. This loss of cellular energy likely damages these and other tissues, leading to heart problems, movement difficulties, and other features of DCMA syndrome. "
376,DNM2 ,dynamin 2,"The DNM2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called dynamin 2. Dynamin 2 is present in cells throughout the body. It is involved in endocytosis, which is a process that brings substances into the cell. During endocytosis, the cell membrane folds around a substance (such as a protein) outside the cell to form a sac-like structure called a vesicle. The vesicle is drawn into the cell and is pinched off from the cell membrane. Dynamin 2 is thought to play a key role in altering the cell membrane to form these vesicles.Dynamin 2 is also involved in the cell's structural framework (cytoskeleton). The protein interacts with multiple parts of the cytoskeleton, including tube-like structures called microtubules and proteins called actin, which organize into filaments to provide structure. These parts of the cytoskeleton are involved in movement of molecules within the cells, cell shape, cell mobility, and attachment of cells to one another.","Centronuclear myopathy At least 25 mutations in the DNM2 gene have been found to cause centronuclear myopathy, a condition that is characterized by muscle weakness (myopathy) in the skeletal muscles, which are the muscles used for movement. Most of these mutations change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in regions of the gene known as exon 8, exon 11, and exon 16. These mutations lead to a change in the structure of dynamin 2. DNM2 gene mutations that cause centronuclear myopathy are described as ""gain-of-function"" because they appear to enhance the activity of dynamin 2, affecting endocytosis and leading to disorganization of structures similar to microtubules, called transverse tubules (T tubules), which are found within the membrane of muscle fibers. The T tubules are necessary for normal muscle tensing (contractions) and relaxation. As a result of the DNM2 gene mutations, the structure of muscle cells becomes abnormal and they cannot contract and relax normally, leading to the muscle weakness that is characteristic of centronuclear myopathy. "
377,DNMT1 ,DNA methyltransferase 1,"The DNMT1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called DNA methyltransferase 1. This enzyme is involved in DNA methylation, which is the addition of methyl groups, consisting of one carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms, to DNA molecules. In particular, the enzyme helps add methyl groups to DNA building blocks (nucleotides) called cytosines.DNA methylation is important in many cellular functions. These include determining whether the instructions in a particular segment of DNA are carried out or suppressed (gene silencing), regulating reactions involving proteins and fats (lipids), and controlling the processing of chemicals that relay signals in the nervous system (neurotransmitters). DNA methyltransferase 1 is active in the adult nervous system. Although its specific function is not well understood, the enzyme may help regulate nerve cell (neuron) maturation and specialization (differentiation), the ability of neurons to move (migrate) and connect with each other, and neuron survival.","Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, deafness, and narcolepsy At least four DNMT1 gene mutations have been identified in people with a nervous system disorder called autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, deafness, and narcolepsy (ADCADN). Features of this disorder include difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), hearing loss caused by abnormalities of the inner ear (sensorineural deafness), and excessive daytime sleepiness (narcolepsy). Cognitive decline occurs as the disorder progresses. Numbness, tingling, or pain in the arms and legs (sensory neuropathy) can also occur. Affected individuals usually survive into their forties or fifties.The DNMT1 gene mutations associated with this disorder affect a region of the DNA methyltransferase 1 enzyme, known as the targeting sequence, that helps direct the methylation process to the correct segments of DNA. As a result of these mutations, methylation is abnormal, which affects the expression of multiple genes. Maintenance of the neurons that make up the nervous system is disrupted, leading to the signs and symptoms of ADCADN. "
378,DNMT3A ,DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha,"The DNMT3A gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha. This enzyme is involved in DNA methylation, which is the addition of methyl groups, consisting of one carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms, to DNA molecules. In particular, the enzyme helps add methyl groups to DNA building blocks (nucleotides) called cytosines.DNA methylation is important in many cellular functions. These include determining whether the instructions in a particular segment of DNA are carried out or suppressed (gene silencing), regulating reactions involving proteins and fats, and controlling the processing of chemicals that relay signals in the nervous system (neurotransmitters). DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha is particularly important for establishing DNA methylation patterns during development before birth. The enzyme also functions in early cells that can give rise to more mature cell types. In early blood cells, called hematopoietic stem cells, the methylation patterns established by DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha promote maturation (differentiation) into different blood cell types.","DNMT3A overgrowth syndrome At least 16 mutations in the DNMT3A gene have been found to cause DNMT3A overgrowth syndrome. This condition is characterized by faster than normal growth before and after birth, a distinctive facial appearance, and intellectual disability.DNMT3A gene mutations that cause DNMT3A overgrowth syndrome are found in all of the body's cells and lead to a decrease in normal enzyme function. Some of these DNMT3A gene mutations lead to a decrease in normal enzyme function. As a result, there is a reduction in DNA methylation, particularly affecting DNA methylation before birth. It is unclear how other mutations affect protein function. Decreased DNA methylation likely disrupts the normal regulation of important developmental genes, although how these change cause the specific features of DNMT3A overgrowth syndrome is unknown.At least one DNMT3A gene alteration that causes DNMT3A overgrowth syndrome deletes the entire DNMT3A gene and multiple neighboring genes. While this deletion leads to the signs and symptoms of DNMT3A overgrowth syndrome, it is difficult to determine what role the other missing genes have in contributing to the development of health problems in affected individuals. "
379,DOCK6 ,dedicator of cytokinesis 6,"The DOCK6 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). GEFs turn on (activate) proteins called GTPases, which play an important role in chemical signaling within cells. Often referred to as molecular switches, GTPases can be turned on and off. GTPases are turned off (inactivated) when they are attached (bound) to a molecule called GDP and are activated when they are bound to another molecule called GTP. The DOCK6 protein activates GTPases known as Cdc42 and Rac1 by exchanging GTP for the attached GDP. Once Cdc42 and Rac1 are active, they transmit signals that are critical for various aspects of embryonic development. The DOCK6 protein appears to regulate these GTPases specifically during development of the limbs, skull, and heart. DOCK6 also plays a role in the development of fibers (axons) that extend from nerve cells.","Adams-Oliver syndrome Mutations in the DOCK6 gene cause Adams-Oliver syndrome, a condition characterized by areas of missing skin (aplasia cutis congenita), usually on the scalp, and malformations of the hands and feet. Neurological abnormalities, such as brain or eye malformations and intellectual disability, are more common in DOCK6-related Adams-Oliver syndrome than in cases associated with other genes. Most DOCK6 gene mutations involved in this condition lead to production of an abnormally short DOCK6 protein that is likely unable to function. Other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the DOCK6 protein, which impairs the protein's normal function. The inability of DOCK6 to turn on Cdc42 or Rac1 leads to a reduction in their signaling, which impairs proper development of certain tissues, including the skin on the top of the head and the bones in the hands and feet. "
380,DOCK8 ,dedicator of cytokinesis 8,"The DOCK8 gene provides instructions for making a member of the DOCK family of proteins. The proteins in this family act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). GEFs turn on (activate) proteins called GTPases, which play an important role in chemical signaling within cells. Signaling stimulated by DOCK family proteins are typically involved in the arrangement of the structural framework inside cells (the cytoskeleton). By controlling the shape of the cytoskeleton, DOCK family proteins play a role in cell structure and movement (migration).The DOCK8 protein is found most abundantly in cells of the immune system. This protein plays a critical role in the survival and function of several types of immune system cells, including T cells, NK cells, and B cells. T cells and NK cells recognize and attack foreign invaders, such as viruses, to prevent infection. B cells produce proteins called antibodies, which attach to foreign particles and germs and mark them for destruction.Through its function as a GEF, the DOCK8 protein helps maintain the structure and integrity of T cells and NK cells. It also aids in the movement of these immune system cells to sites of infection, particularly the skin. The DOCK8 protein is also involved in chemical signaling pathways that stimulate B cells to mature and produce antibodies. The protein is also involved in the normal development and survival of other types of immune system cells.","DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome More than 130 mutations in the DOCK8 gene have been found to cause DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome (also called autosomal recessive hyper-IgE syndrome or AR-HIES). DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome is an immune system disorder that causes recurrent severe infections of the skin and respiratory tract. Affected individuals may have other immune system problems, such as allergies, asthma, or an inflammatory skin disorder called eczema. Most of the mutations involved in DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome delete regions of DNA from the DOCK8 gene. These deletions and other DOCK8 gene mutations lead to production of an abnormally short protein or production of no protein. As a result, affected individuals have little or no functional DOCK8 protein.A shortage of DOCK8 protein impairs normal immune cell development and function. It is thought that T cells lacking DOCK8 protein cannot maintain their shape as they move through dense spaces, such as those found within the skin. The abnormal cells die too easily, resulting in reduced numbers of these cells. A shortage of T cells impairs the immune response to foreign invaders, accounting for the severe skin infections common in DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome. A lack of DOCK8 protein also impairs B cell maturation and the production of certain antibodies. Impairment of this type of immune response leads to recurrent respiratory tract infections in people with this disorder.For unknown reasons, a reduction of DOCK8 protein results in higher-than-normal production of an immune system protein known as immunoglobulin E (IgE), which plays a role in allergic reactions. As a result, people with DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome have an increased risk of food and environmental allergies. "
381,DOK7 ,docking protein 7,"The DOK7 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is necessary for the formation of connections between nerve cells and muscle cells, which occur in the neuromuscular junction. The neuromuscular junction is the area between the ends of nerve cells and muscle cells where signals are relayed to trigger muscle movement. The Dok-7 protein participates in turning on (activating) a protein called MuSK that plays a key role in organizing the various proteins important for the development and maintenance of the neuromuscular junction. In particular, the MuSK protein is involved in concentrating a protein called the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in the muscle membrane at the neuromuscular junction."" The AChR protein is critical for signaling between nerve and muscle cells, which is necessary for movement.","Congenital myasthenic syndrome At least 45 mutations in the DOK7 gene have been found to cause congenital myasthenic syndrome. A mutation that frequently occurs is the addition of four DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the DOK7 gene (written as 1124_1127dupTGCC). Mutations in this gene lead to the production of a defective Dok-7 protein that cannot activate the MuSK protein. As a result, less AChR is present in the neuromuscular junction, which reduces signaling between nerve and muscle cells. These signaling abnormalities lead to decreased muscle movement and the muscle weakness characteristic of congenital myasthenic syndrome. For reasons that are unclear, people with mutations in the DOK7 gene tend to have muscle weakness in the shoulders, hips, and limbs, known as limb-girdle muscle weakness. "
382,DOLK ,dolichol kinase,"The DOLK gene provides instructions for making the dolichol kinase enzyme, which facilitates the final step of the production of a compound called dolichol phosphate. This compound is critical for a process called glycosylation, which attaches groups of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) to proteins. Glycosylation changes proteins in ways that are important for their functions.Dolichol kinase is found in the membrane of a cell compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein processing and transport. This enzyme adds a phosphate group (a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms) to the compound dolichol to produce dolichol phosphate. During glycosylation, sugars are added to dolichol phosphate to build the oligosaccharide chain. Once the chain is formed, dolichol phosphate transports the oligosaccharide to the protein that needs to be glycosylated and attaches it to a specific site on the protein.Dolichol phosphate is also needed for the formation of GPI anchors. These are complexes that attach (bind) to proteins and then bind to the outer surface of the cell membrane to ensure that the protein is available on the cell surface when needed.","DOLK-congenital disorder of glycosylation At least six mutations in the DOLK gene have been found to cause DOLK-congenital disorder of glycosylation (DOLK-CDG, formerly known as congenital disorder of glycosylation type Im). This condition often causes the heart to be weakened and enlarged (dilated cardiomyopathy), but it can also result in neurological problems as well as other signs and symptoms.DOLK gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the dolichol kinase enzyme, leading to an enzyme with reduced or absent activity. Without properly functioning dolichol kinase, dolichol phosphate is not produced and glycosylation cannot proceed normally. In particular, a protein known to stabilize heart muscle fibers, called alpha-dystroglycan, has been shown to have reduced glycosylation in people with DOLK-CDG. Impaired glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan disrupts its normal function, which damages heart muscle fibers as they repeatedly contract and relax. Over time, the fibers weaken and break down, leading to dilated cardiomyopathy. The other signs and symptoms of DOLK-CDG are likely due to the abnormal glycosylation of additional proteins in other organs and tissues. "
383,DPY19L2 ,dpy-19 like 2,"The DPY19L2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in developing sperm cells. The DPY19L2 protein plays a role in the development of the acrosome, a cap-like structure in the head of sperm cells. The acrosome contains enzymes that break down the outer membrane of egg cells, allowing the sperm to fertilize an egg.The developing acrosome is attached to the nucleus of the cell. The DPY19L2 protein, which is found within the membrane of the nucleus, helps attach the forming acrosome to the nuclear membrane. As the acrosome develops and the sperm cell matures, the acrosome moves to the tip of the head of the sperm, which helps the head elongate into an oval shape.","Globozoospermia At least 17 DPY19L2 gene mutations have been found in men with globozoospermia, a condition characterized by abnormal sperm cells that have a round head and no acrosome. Approximately 70 percent of men with this condition have mutations in DPY19L2. Most of these mutations delete large regions of the gene or the whole gene. Others change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the DPY19L2 protein. These mutations lead to a loss of functional DPY19L2 protein. Without this protein, the forming acrosome is not attached to the nucleus and is removed from the cell. As a result, sperm cells have no acrosome and the head of the sperm does not elongate. The abnormal sperm are unable to get through the outer membrane of an egg cell to fertilize it, leading to an inability to father biological children (infertility) in affected men. Researchers have described other characteristics of the abnormal sperm cells that make fertilization of an egg cell difficult, although it is not clear how changes in the DPY19L2 gene are involved in development of these characteristics. "
384,DPYD ,dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase,"The DPYD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, which is involved in the breakdown of molecules called uracil and thymine when they are not needed. Uracil and thymine are pyrimidines, which are one type of nucleotide. Nucleotides are building blocks of DNA, its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as ATP and GTP that serve as energy sources in the cell.Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase is involved in the first step of the breakdown of pyrimidines. This enzyme converts uracil to another molecule called 5,6-dihydrouracil and converts thymine to 5,6-dihydrothymine. The molecules created when pyrimidines are broken down are excreted by the body or used in other cellular processes.","Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency More than 50 mutations in the DPYD gene have been identified in people with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency. DPYD gene mutations interfere with the breakdown of uracil and thymine and result in excess quantities of these molecules in the blood, urine, and the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid). It is unclear how the excess uracil and thymine are related to the specific neurological problems that affect some people with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency.Mutations in the DPYD gene also interfere with the breakdown of drugs with structures similar to the pyrimidines, such as the cancer drugs 5-fluorouracil and capecitabine. As a result, these drugs accumulate in the body and cause the severe reactions that can occur in people with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency. "
385,DPYS ,dihydropyrimidinase,"The DPYS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called dihydropyrimidinase. This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of molecules called pyrimidines, which are building blocks of DNA and its chemical cousin RNA. The dihydropyrimidinase enzyme is involved in the second step of the three-step process that breaks down pyrimidines. This step opens the ring-like structures of molecules called 5,6-dihydrothymine and 5,6-dihydrouracil. Further breakdown of these molecules leads to the production of other molecules called beta-aminoisobutyric acid and beta-alanine, which are thought to play roles in the nervous system. Beta-aminoisobutyric acid increases the production and release (secretion) of a protein called leptin, which has been found to help protect brain cells from damage caused by toxins, inflammation, and other factors. Beta-alanine is thought to be involved in sending signals between nerve cells (synaptic transmission) and in controlling the level of a chemical messenger (neurotransmitter) called dopamine.The dihydropyrimidinase enzyme also helps break down certain drugs called fluoropyrimidines that are used to treat cancer. Common examples of these drugs are 5-fluorouracil and capecitabine.","Dihydropyrimidinase deficiency At least 23 DPYS gene mutations have been identified in people with dihydropyrimidinase deficiency, a disorder that can cause neurological and gastrointestinal problems in some affected individuals. Other people with dihydropyrimidinase deficiency have no signs or symptoms related to the disorder, and in these individuals the condition can be diagnosed only by laboratory testing. People with dihydropyrimidinase deficiency, including those who otherwise exhibit no symptoms, may be vulnerable to severe, potentially life-threatening toxic reactions to fluoropyrimidines. These drugs may not be broken down efficiently and can build up to toxic levels in the body (fluoropyrimidine toxicity), leading to drug reactions including gastrointestinal problems, blood abnormalities, and other signs and symptoms.The DPYS gene mutations that cause dihydropyrimidinase deficiency greatly reduce or eliminate dihydropyrimidinase enzyme function. As a result, the enzyme is unable to begin the breakdown of 5,6-dihydrothymine and 5,6-dihydrouracil. Excessive amounts of these molecules accumulate in the blood and in the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord (the cerebrospinal fluid or CSF) and are released in the urine.The relationship between the inability to break down 5,6-dihydrothymine and 5,6-dihydrouracil and the specific features of dihydropyrimidinase deficiency is unclear. Failure to complete this step in the breakdown of pyrimidines also impedes the final step of the process, which produces beta-aminoisobutyric acid and beta-alanine. Reduced production of these molecules may impair their function in the nervous system, leading to neurological problems in some people with dihydropyrimidinase deficiency. Because fluoropyrimidine drugs are broken down by the same three-step process as pyrimidines, deficiency of the dihydropyrimidinase enzyme can lead to the drug buildup that causes fluoropyrimidine toxicity.It is unknown why some people with dihydropyrimidinase deficiency do not develop health problems related to the condition; other genetic and environmental factors likely help determine the effects of this disorder. "
386,DRD5 ,dopamine receptor D5,"The DRD5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called dopamine receptor D5, which is found in the brain. This protein works together with a chemical messenger (neurotransmitter) called dopamine. Dopamine fits into the D5 receptor like a key in a lock, which triggers chemical reactions within nerve cells. Dopamine signaling has many critical functions in the brain, including regulation of attention, mood, memory, learning, and movement.","Benign essential blepharospasm Several studies have examined a possible relationship between a common variation (polymorphism) in the DRD5 gene and benign essential blepharospasm. The results of these studies have been mixed. Some research has suggested that the polymorphism, a short repeated segment of DNA known as allele 2, occurs more often in people with benign essential blepharospasm than in people without the disorder. However, other studies have found no connection between this polymorphism and benign essential blepharospasm. Researchers are still working to clarify whether variants in the DRD5 gene are associated with this disorder. "
387,DSC2 ,desmocollin 2,"The DSC2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called desmocollin-2. This protein is found in many tissues, although it appears to be particularly important in the heart muscle and skin. Desmocollin-2 is a major component of specialized structures called desmosomes. These structures help hold neighboring cells together, which provides strength and stability to tissues. Desmosomes may also be involved in other critical cell functions, including chemical signaling pathways, the process by which cells mature to perform specific functions (differentiation), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).","Keratoderma with woolly hair At least one mutation in the DSC2 gene has been found to cause a form of keratoderma with woolly hair classified as type III. It is characterized by thick, calloused skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (palmoplantar keratoderma); coarse, dry, fine, and tightly curled hair; and a potentially life-threatening form of heart disease called arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC).The known mutation, which is written as 1841delG, deletes one DNA building block (base pair) from the DSC2 gene. The resulting abnormal version of the desmocollin-2 protein alters the structure of desmosomes, preventing cells from attaching to one another effectively. Researchers suspect that the impaired connections between cells make the skin, hair, and heart muscle more fragile. Over time, as these tissues are exposed to mechanical stress (for example, friction on the surface of the skin or the constant contraction and relaxation of the heart muscle), they become damaged and can no longer function normally. This mechanism probably underlies the skin, hair, and heart problems that occur in keratoderma with woolly hair type III. Studies suggest that abnormal cell signaling may also contribute to cardiomyopathy in people with this condition.Several other mutations in the DSC2 gene cause ARVC without palmoplantar keratoderma or woolly hair. It is unclear why some mutations in this gene affect the skin and hair, while others do not. "
388,DSG4 ,desmoglein 4,"The DSG4 gene provides instructions for making a protein called desmoglein 4 (DSG4). This protein is found in specialized structures called desmosomes that are located in the membrane surrounding certain cells. Desmosomes help attach cells to one another and play a role in communication between cells. The DSG4 protein is found in cells in certain regions of hair follicles, including the inner compartment of the hair strand (shaft) known as the cortex. Hair growth occurs at the hair follicle when cells divide and the hair shaft is pushed upward and extends beyond the skin.Desmosomes provide strength to the hair and are involved in signaling between neighboring cells within the hair shaft. The DSG4 protein may play a role in communicating the signals for cells to mature (differentiate) and form the hair shaft. In addition, the DSG4 protein is found in the upper layers of the skin where it provides strength and communicates signals for the skin cells to mature.","Autosomal recessive hypotrichosis At least 10 mutations in the DSG4 gene have been found to cause autosomal recessive hypotrichosis, a condition that results in sparse hair growth (hypotrichosis) on the scalp, and less frequently, other parts of the body. A particular mutation that deletes a piece of genetic material in the DSG4 gene (written as Ex5_8) is a common cause of the condition in individuals of Pakistani ancestry. This mutation impairs the protein's ability to help cells attach to one another. Other DSG4 gene mutations result in the production of abnormal DSG4 proteins that cannot communicate signals between cells within hair follicles or skin. As a result, hair follicles are structurally abnormal and often underdeveloped. Irregular hair follicles alter the structure and growth of hair shafts, leading to fragile hair that breaks easily. A lack of normal DSG4 protein function may weaken the skin and contribute to the skin problems sometimes seen in individuals with autosomal recessive hypotrichosis. "
389,DSP ,desmoplakin,"The DSP gene provides instructions for making a protein called desmoplakin. This protein is found primarily in cells of the heart and skin, where it is a major component of specialized structures called desmosomes. These structures help hold neighboring cells together, which provides strength and stability to tissues. Desmosomes may also be involved in other critical cell functions, including chemical signaling pathways, the process by which cells mature to perform specific functions (differentiation), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).","Keratoderma with woolly hair Several mutations in the DSP gene have been found to cause a form of keratoderma with woolly hair classified as type II. This form of the condition is also known as Carvajal syndrome. It is characterized by thick, calloused skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (palmoplantar keratoderma); coarse, dry, fine, and tightly curled hair; and a potentially life-threatening form of heart disease called dilated left ventricular cardiomyopathy.The DSP gene mutations that cause keratoderma with woolly hair type II lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the desmoplakin protein. The abnormal protein alters the structure of desmosomes, preventing cells from attaching to one another effectively. Researchers suspect that the impaired connections between cells make the skin, hair, and heart muscle more fragile. Over time, as these tissues are exposed to mechanical stress (for example, friction on the surface of the skin or the constant contraction and relaxation of the heart muscle), they become damaged and can no longer function normally. This mechanism probably underlies the skin, hair, and heart problems that occur in keratoderma with woolly hair type II. Studies suggest that abnormal cell signaling may also contribute to cardiomyopathy in people with this condition. "
390,DSPP ,dentin sialophosphoprotein,"The DSPP gene provides instructions for making a protein called dentin sialophosphoprotein. Soon after it is produced, this protein is cut into two smaller proteins: dentin sialoprotein and dentin phosphoprotein. These proteins are components of dentin, which is a bone-like substance that makes up the protective middle layer of each tooth. A third smaller protein produced from dentin sialophosphoprotein, called dentin glycoprotein, was identified in pigs but has not been found in humans.Although the exact functions of the DSPP-derived proteins are unknown, these proteins appear to be essential for normal tooth development. Dentin phosphoprotein is thought to be involved in the normal hardening of collagen, the most abundant protein in dentin. Specifically, dentin phosphoprotein may play a role in the deposition of mineral crystals among collagen fibers (mineralization).The DSPP gene is also active in the inner ear, although it is unclear whether it plays a role in normal hearing.","Dentinogenesis imperfecta More than 20 mutations in the DSPP gene have been identified in people with dentinogenesis imperfecta. These genetic changes are responsible for two forms of this disorder, type II and type III. Mutations in this gene also cause dentin dysplasia type II, a disorder with signs and symptoms very similar to those of dentinogenesis imperfecta. However, dentin dysplasia type II affects the primary (baby) teeth much more than the permanent teeth. Some researchers believe that this type of dentin dysplasia and dentinogenesis imperfecta types II and III are actually forms of a single disorder.About half of DSPP gene mutations affect dentin sialoprotein, altering its transport in cells. The remaining mutations affect dentin phosphoprotein, interfering with its normal production and/or secretion. As a result of these abnormalities of DSPP-related proteins, teeth have abnormally soft dentin. Teeth with defective dentin are discolored, weak, and prone to breakage and decay.Although the DSPP gene is active in the inner ear, it is unclear whether DSPP gene mutations are related to the hearing loss found in a few older individuals with dentinogenesis imperfecta type II. "
391,DUOX2 ,dual oxidase 2,"The DUOX2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called dual oxidase 2. This enzyme is found in the thyroid gland, which is a butterfly-shaped tissue in the lower neck. The enzyme is also found in salivary glands, the digestive tract, and airways in the throat and lungs. Dual oxidase 2 helps generate a chemical called hydrogen peroxide. In the thyroid, hydrogen peroxide is required for one of the final steps in the production of thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones play an important role in regulating growth, brain development, and the rate of chemical reactions in the body (metabolism).","Congenital hypothyroidism Researchers have identified several DUOX2 gene mutations that cause congenital hypothyroidism, a condition characterized by a reduction of thyroid hormone levels that is present from birth. Most of these mutations result in an abnormally small version of the dual oxidase 2 enzyme. The remaining mutations change one of the building blocks (amino acids) used to make the enzyme, which probably alters the enzyme's structure. All DUOX2 gene mutations limit the enzyme's ability to generate hydrogen peroxide. Without sufficient hydrogen peroxide, thyroid hormone production is disrupted. In some cases, the thyroid gland is enlarged (goiter) in an attempt to compensate for reduced thyroid hormone production. Because cases caused by mutations in the DUOX2 gene are due to a disruption of thyroid hormone synthesis, they are classified as thyroid dyshormonogenesis.The reduction in thyroid hormone production is affected by the number of DUOX2 genes with a mutation. Each cell in the body has two copies of the DUOX2 gene. If both copies of the gene have a mutation, cells in the thyroid gland generate very little hydrogen peroxide. As a result, thyroid hormone levels are extremely low, causing severe congenital hypothyroidism. If only one copy of the DUOX2 gene is mutated, some hydrogen peroxide is produced. As a result, thyroid hormone levels are slightly reduced, causing mild congenital hypothyroidism. Sometimes, mild congenital hypothyroidism is temporary (transient), and thyroid hormone levels that are low during infancy increase with age. "
392,DUX4 ,double homeobox 4,"The DUX4 gene is located near the end of chromosome 4 in a region known as D4Z4. This region consists of 11 to more than 100 repeated segments, each of which is about 3,300 DNA base pairs (3.3 kb) long. The entire D4Z4 region is normally hypermethylated, which means that it has a large number of methyl groups (consisting of one carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms) attached to the DNA. The addition of methyl groups turns off (silences) genes, so hypermethylated regions of DNA tend to have fewer genes that are turned on (active).Each of the repeated segments in the D4Z4 region contains a copy of the DUX4 gene; the copy closest to the end of chromosome 4 is called DUX4, while the other copies are described as ""DUX4-like"" or DUX4L. Hypermethylation of the D4Z4 region keeps the DUX4-like genes silenced all the time. No protein is produced from these genes. The DUX4 gene is also silenced in most adult cells and tissues, although it is active during early development and in the testes of adult males. Little is known about the function of the protein produced from the active DUX4 gene; it appears to help control the activity of other genes.The DUX4 gene (the copy closest to the end of chromosome 4) is located next to a regulatory region of DNA known as a pLAM sequence, which is necessary for the production of the DUX4 protein. Some copies of chromosome 4 have a functional pLAM sequence, while others do not. Copies of chromosome 4 with a functional pLAM sequence are described as 4qA or ""permissive."" Those without a functional pLAM sequence are described as 4qB or ""non-permissive."" Without a functional pLAM sequence, no DUX4 protein is made. Because there are two copies of chromosome 4 in each cell, individuals may have two ""permissive"" copies of chromosome 4, two ""non-permissive"" copies, or one of each.","Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy Changes in the D4Z4 region of chromosome 4, which contains the DUX4 gene, cause facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. This disorder is characterized by muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) that worsens slowly over time. Two types of the disorder have been described: type 1 (FSHD1) and type 2 (FSHD2). Both types result from hypomethylation of the D4Z4 region, in which the DNA has fewer methyl groups attached than normal. In FSHD1, hypomethylation occurs because the D4Z4 region is abnormally shortened (contracted), containing between 1 and 10 repeats instead of the usual 11 to 100 repeats. In FSHD2, hypomethylation most often results from mutations in a gene called SMCHD1, which normally hypermethylates the D4Z4 region.Hypomethylation of the D4Z4 region prevents the DUX4 gene from being silenced in cells and tissues where it is usually turned off, such as adult muscle cells. However, hypomethylation of the D4Z4 region results in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy only when it occurs with a ""permissive"" chromosome 4. The ""permissive"" chromosome contains a working pLAM sequence, which allows protein to be produced from the abnormally active DUX4 gene. Researchers believe that the protein influences the activity of other genes, particularly in muscle cells. However, it is unknown how presence of the DUX4 protein damages or destroys these cells, leading to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. "
393,DVL1 ,dishevelled segment polarity protein 1,"The DVL1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in development before birth. It is one of three DVL genes in humans (DVL1, DVL2, and DVL3). The proteins produced from these genes work together in chemical signaling pathways known as Wnt signaling. These pathways control the activity of certain genes and regulate the interactions between cells during embryonic development. Signaling involving the DVL proteins appears to be important for the normal development of the brain, skeleton, and many other parts of the body.","Robinow syndrome At least 15 mutations in the DVL1 gene have been found to cause the autosomal dominant form of Robinow syndrome, a condition that affects the development of many parts of the body, particularly the skeleton. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. DVL1 gene mutations underlie a variant type of autosomal dominant Robinow syndrome called the osteosclerotic form, which features increased bone mineral density (osteosclerosis) affecting the bones of the skull.All of the identified DVL1 gene mutations occur in a region of the gene known as exon 14. Each mutation is predicted to remove a segment of protein building blocks (amino acids) from the end of the DVL1 protein and add more than 100 new amino acids. Researchers are working to determine how these changes affect the protein's function. The changes may have a dominant-negative effect, which means that the altered protein produced from one copy of the DVL1 gene interferes with the function of the normal protein produced from the other copy of the gene. Alternately, the changes may have a gain-of-function effect, giving the altered protein a new, as-yet-undetermined function. Either way, the abnormal DVL1 protein likely impairs Wnt signaling. Problems with Wnt signaling pathways disrupt the development of many organs and tissues, leading to the features of Robinow syndrome. It is unclear how DVL1 gene mutations cause osteosclerosis in addition to the other signs and symptoms of the condition. "
394,DVL3 ,dishevelled segment polarity protein 3,"The DVL3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in development before birth. It is one of three DVL genes in humans (DVL1, DVL2, and DVL3). The proteins produced from these genes work together in chemical signaling pathways known as Wnt signaling. These pathways control the activity of certain genes and regulate the interactions between cells during embryonic development. Signaling involving the DVL proteins appears to be important for the normal development of the brain, skeleton, and many other parts of the body.","Robinow syndrome At least six mutations in the DVL3 gene have been found to cause the autosomal dominant form of Robinow syndrome, a condition that affects the development of many parts of the body, particularly the skeleton. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.All of the identified DVL3 gene mutations occur near one end of the gene and are predicted to shorten the DVL3 protein. Researchers are working to determine how these changes affect the protein's function. The changes may have a dominant-negative effect, which means that the altered protein produced from one copy of the DVL3 gene interferes with the function of the normal protein produced from the other copy of the gene. Alternately, the changes may have a gain-of-function effect, giving the altered protein a new, as-yet-undetermined function. Either way, the abnormal DVL3 protein likely impairs Wnt signaling. Problems with Wnt signaling pathways disrupt the development of many organs and tissues before birth, leading to Robinow syndrome. "
395,DYNC1H1 ,dynein cytoplasmic 1 heavy chain 1,"The DYNC1H1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of a group (complex) of proteins called dynein. This complex is found in the fluid inside cells (cytoplasm). Dynein is turned on (activated) by attaching (binding) to another complex called dynactin. This dynein-dynactin complex binds to various materials within cells. Using energy provided by molecules called ATP, the dynein-dynactin complex moves material along a track-like system of small tubes called microtubules, similar to a conveyer belt. The dynein-dynactin complex is necessary for protein transport, positioning of cell compartments, movement of structures within the cell, and many other cell processes. Dynein helps neighboring nerve cells (neurons) communicate by transporting sac-like structures called synaptic vesicles that contain chemical messengers. When synaptic vesicles are passed from one neuron to another, the dynein-dynactin complex transports the vesicle from the edge of the cell to the nucleus, where the chemical message is received.The parts (subunits) of a dynein complex are classified by weight as heavy, intermediate, light intermediate, or light chains. Two heavy chain proteins bind together to form the core of the dynein complex. Combinations of intermediate, light intermediate, and light chains make up the rest of the complex. The protein produced from the DYNC1H1 gene is a heavy chain. Other subunits are produced from different genes.",Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Genetics Home Reference provides information about Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. 
396,DYNC2H1 ,dynein cytoplasmic 2 heavy chain 1,"The DYNC2H1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of a group (complex) of proteins called dynein-2. The dynein-2 complex is found in cell structures known as cilia. Cilia are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. Dynein-2 is involved in a process called intraflagellar transport (IFT), by which materials are carried within cilia. Specifically, dynein-2 is a motor that uses energy from the molecule ATP to power the transport of materials from the tip of cilia to the base.IFT is essential for the assembly and maintenance of cilia. These cell structures play central roles in many different chemical signaling pathways, including a series of reactions called the Sonic Hedgehog pathway. These pathways are important for the growth and division (proliferation) and maturation (differentiation) of cells. In particular, Sonic Hedgehog appears to be essential for the proliferation and differentiation of cells that ultimately give rise to cartilage and bone.","Asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy More than 50 mutations in the DYNC2H1 gene have been identified in people with asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy, an inherited disorder of bone growth characterized by a small chest, short ribs, and shortened bones in the arms and legs. Mutations in this gene account for up to half of all cases of this condition. Most of the known mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the DYNC2H1 protein. The dynein-2 complex made with the altered protein cannot function normally, which disrupts IFT from the tip of cilia to the base and causes a buildup of materials at the tip. Researchers speculate that these changes in IFT alter certain signaling pathways, including the Sonic Hedgehog pathway, which may underlie the abnormalities of bone growth characteristic of asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy.In some affected individuals, asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy is also associated with abnormalities of the kidneys, liver, retinas, and other tissues. However, when the disorder results from DYNC2H1 gene mutations, its features are usually limited to problems with bone growth. The reasons for this difference are unknown. "
397,DYRK1A ,dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A,"The DYRK1A gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is important in the development of the nervous system. The DYRK1A enzyme is a kinase, which means that it adds a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) to other proteins through a process called phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of proteins helps to control (regulate) their activity.The proteins whose activity the DYRK1A enzyme helps regulate are involved in various processes in cells, including cell growth and division (proliferation) and the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation). In nerve cells (neurons), the DYRK1A enzyme is involved in the formation and maturation of dendritic spines from dendrites. Dendrites are specialized extensions from neurons that are essential for the transmission of nerve impulses. Dendritic spines are small outgrowths from dendrites that further help transmit nerve impulses and increase communication between neurons.","Autism spectrum disorder At least 11 DYRK1A gene mutations have been identified in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a varied condition characterized by impaired social skills, communication problems, and repetitive behaviors. Most people with ASD associated with DYRK1A gene mutations also have other signs and symptoms. In some cases, they have a particular combination of additional features, including intellectual disability, speech problems, anxiety, and an unusually small head (microcephaly). Other signs and symptoms that may occur in these individuals include recurrent seizures (epilepsy), characteristic facial features, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), foot abnormalities, and walking problems (gait disturbance). This pattern of signs and symptoms is sometimes called DYRK1A-related intellectual disability syndrome.DYRK1A gene mutations result in loss of the DYRK1A enzyme or an enzyme that does not function properly. Impaired or absent DYRK1A enzyme function likely leads to abnormal regulation of gene expression and disrupts proper neural development. However, the specific relationship between DYRK1A gene mutations and the signs and symptoms of ASD, as well as the other features that may occur in people with these mutations, is unclear. "
398,DYSF ,dysferlin,"The DYSF gene provides instructions for making a protein called dysferlin. This protein is found in the thin membrane called the sarcolemma that surrounds muscle fibers. Dysferlin is thought to aid in repairing the sarcolemma when it becomes damaged or torn due to muscle strain. Researchers suggest that dysferlin may also be involved in the formation of new muscle fibers (regeneration) and in inflammation, but little is known about these functions.","Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy More than 140 mutations in the DYSF gene that can cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B have been identified. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is a group of related disorders characterized by muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy), particularly in the shoulders, hips, thighs, and upper arms. Muscle problems caused by DYSF gene mutations, such as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and others (see below), are called dysferlinopathies.DYSF gene mutations may disrupt the function of the dysferlin protein and interfere with the muscle repair process. Studies suggest that inefficient repair of damaged muscle fibers may lead to inflammation and degeneration of muscles, resulting in muscle weakness. "
399,EARS2 ,"glutamyl-tRNA synthetase 2, mitochondrial","The EARS2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called mitochondrial glutamyl-tRNA synthetase. This enzyme is important in the production (synthesis) of proteins in cellular structures called mitochondria, the energy-producing centers in cells. While most protein synthesis occurs in the fluid surrounding the cell nucleus (cytoplasm), some proteins are synthesized in the mitochondria.During protein synthesis, in either the mitochondria or the cytoplasm, a type of RNA called transfer RNA (tRNA) helps assemble protein building blocks called amino acids into a chain that forms the protein. Each tRNA carries a specific amino acid to the growing chain. Enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, including mitochondrial glutamyl-tRNA synthetase, attach a particular amino acid to a specific tRNA. Mitochondrial glutamyl-tRNA synthetase attaches the amino acid glutamate to the correct tRNA, which helps ensure that glutamate is added at the proper place in the mitochondrial protein.","Leukoencephalopathy with thalamus and brainstem involvement and high lactate At least 23 mutations in the EARS2 gene have been found in individuals with leukoencephalopathy with thalamus and brainstem involvement and high lactate (LTBL), a condition characterized by abnormalities in certain brain regions, including the thalamus and the brainstem (the part of the brain that connects to the spinal cord), and a high level of a substance called lactate in the brain and elsewhere in the body. Affected individuals typically have problems with thinking and motor abilities and with controlling muscle function.The EARS2 gene mutations involved in LTBL likely reduce the amount of mitochondrial glutamyl-tRNA synthetase. A shortage of this protein is thought to prevent the normal assembly of new proteins within mitochondria. Researchers speculate that impaired protein assembly disrupts mitochondrial energy production. However, it is unclear exactly how EARS2 gene mutations lead to the features of LTBL. "
400,EBP ,"EBP, cholestenol delta-isomerase","The EBP gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 3β-hydroxysteroid-Δ8,Δ7-isomerase. This enzyme is responsible for one of the final steps in the production of cholesterol. Specifically, it converts a molecule called 8(9)-cholestenol to lathosterol. Other enzymes then modify lathosterol to produce cholesterol.Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is produced in the body and obtained from foods that come from animals (particularly egg yolks, meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products). Although too much cholesterol is a risk factor for heart disease, this molecule is necessary for normal embryonic development and has important functions both before and after birth. It is a structural component of cell membranes and plays a role in the production of certain hormones and acids used in digestion (bile acids).","X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 2 More than 55 mutations in the EBP gene have been found to cause X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 2, a condition that occurs almost exclusively in females and is characterized by bone, skin, and eye abnormalities. Some of the mutations responsible for this condition in females insert or delete a small amount of genetic material from the EBP gene, while others change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the 3β-hydroxysteroid-Δ8,Δ7-isomerase enzyme. All of these mutations impair the normal function of the enzyme, preventing cells from producing enough cholesterol. A shortage of this enzyme also allows potentially toxic byproducts of cholesterol production to build up in the body. The combination of low cholesterol levels and an accumulation of other substances likely disrupts the growth and development of many body systems. It is not known, however, how this disturbance in cholesterol production leads to the specific features of X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 2.Rarely, a severe form of X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 2 has been reported in males. These cases result from changes involving single amino acids in the 3β-hydroxysteroid-Δ8,Δ7-isomerase enzyme. Affected males have some of the same features as affected females, as well as changes in the structure of the brain, moderately to profoundly delayed development, and other birth defects. "
401,ECM1 ,extracellular matrix protein 1,"The ECM1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in most tissues within the extracellular matrix, which is an intricate lattice that forms in the space between cells and provides structural support. The ECM1 protein can attach (bind) to numerous structural proteins and is involved in the growth and maturation (differentiation) of cells, including skin cells called keratinocytes. The protein may also regulate the formation of blood vessels (angiogenesis).Four different versions (isoforms) of the ECM1 protein are produced from the ECM1 gene. These isoforms vary in length and in the tissues where they are found. The most abundant and widespread version is known as ECM1a.","Lipoid proteinosis At least 55 mutations in the ECM1 gene have been found to cause lipoid proteinosis, a condition that results from numerous, small clumps (deposits) of proteins and other molecules that form in various tissues throughout the body. Affected individuals typically have a hoarse voice, skin abnormalities, and neurological and respiratory problems.Typically, mutations that cause lipoid proteinosis occur in areas of the ECM1 gene known as exon 6 and exon 7. One mutation that deletes a single DNA building block (nucleotide) from exon 6 of the ECM1 gene (written 507delT) has been found in multiple individuals around the world. Another mutation that occurs in exon 7 of the gene is common in affected individuals in South Africa and results in a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the protein (written as Gln276Ter or Q276X). The ECM1 gene mutations that cause lipoid proteinosis result in the production of a nonfunctional protein or no protein at all.A lack of functional ECM1 protein reduces binding between ECM1 and other proteins, leading to an unstable extracellular matrix. Without adequate support from the extracellular matrix, cells in the skin and other tissues are weakened. However, the cause of the deposits in skin and other tissues is not clear. The unstable extracellular matrix may cause neighboring cells to overproduce proteins and other materials. It is possible that, as these excess substances accumulate in tissues, they create the deposits characteristic of lipoid proteinosis. "
402,EDA ,ectodysplasin A,"The EDA gene provides instructions for making a protein called ectodysplasin A. This protein is part of a signaling pathway that plays an important role in development before birth. Specifically, it is critical for interactions between two embryonic cell layers called the ectoderm and the mesoderm. In the early embryo, these cell layers form the basis for many of the body's organs and tissues. Ectoderm-mesoderm interactions are essential for the formation of several structures that arise from the ectoderm, including the skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands.One version of the ectodysplasin A protein, known as ectodysplasin A1, interacts with a protein called the ectodysplasin A receptor (produced from the EDAR gene). On the cell surface, ectodysplasin A1 attaches to this receptor like a key in a lock. When these two proteins are connected, they trigger a series of chemical signals that affect cell activities such as division, growth, and maturation. Starting before birth, this signaling pathway controls the formation of ectodermal structures such as hair follicles, sweat glands, and teeth.","Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia More than 300 mutations in the EDA gene have been found to cause hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, the most common form of ectodermal dysplasia. Starting before birth, ectodermal dysplasias result in the abnormal development of the skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands. Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is characterized by a reduced ability to sweat (hypohidrosis), sparse scalp and body hair (hypotrichosis), and several missing teeth (hypodontia) or teeth that are malformed. EDA gene mutations are the most frequent cause of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, accounting for more than half of all cases.Some mutations in the EDA gene change single DNA building blocks (base pairs), whereas other mutations insert or delete a larger section of DNA. These changes lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of the ectodysplasin A1 protein. A shortage of functional ectodysplasin A1 prevents the protein from interacting effectively with its receptor, which impairs chemical signaling needed for interactions between the ectoderm and the mesoderm in early development. Without these signals, hair follicles, teeth, sweat glands, and other ectodermal structures do not form properly, which leads to the characteristic features of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia. "
403,EDAR ,ectodysplasin A receptor,"The EDAR gene provides instructions for making a protein called the ectodysplasin A receptor. This protein is part of a signaling pathway that plays an important role in development before birth. Specifically, it is critical for interactions between two embryonic cell layers called the ectoderm and the mesoderm. In the early embryo, these cell layers form the basis for many of the body's organs and tissues. Ectoderm-mesoderm interactions are essential for the formation of several structures that arise from the ectoderm, including the skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands.The ectodysplasin A receptor interacts with a protein called ectodysplasin A1 (produced from the EDA gene). On the cell surface, ectodysplasin A1 attaches to this receptor like a key in a lock. When these two proteins are connected, they trigger a series of chemical signals that affect cell activities such as division, growth, and maturation. Starting before birth, this signaling pathway controls the formation of ectodermal structures such as hair follicles, sweat glands, and teeth.Studies suggest that common variations (polymorphisms) in the EDAR gene are associated with the thickness and straightness of scalp hair, particularly in East Asian populations. EDAR appears to be one of many genes that influence these hair traits.","Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia More than 50 mutations in the EDAR gene have been found to cause hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, the most common form of ectodermal dysplasia. Starting before birth, ectodermal dysplasias result in the abnormal development of the skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands. Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is characterized by a reduced ability to sweat (hypohidrosis), sparse scalp and body hair (hypotrichosis), and several missing teeth (hypodontia) or teeth that are malformed. EDAR gene mutations account for about 10 percent of all cases of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia.Most of the EDAR gene mutations associated with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the receptor protein. Some of the mutations that cause this condition lead to the production of an abnormal version of the ectodysplasin A receptor. Other mutations prevent cells from producing any functional receptor. All of these genetic changes prevent the receptor from interacting with ectodysplasin A1, which impairs chemical signaling needed for interactions between the ectoderm and the mesoderm in early development. Without these signals, hair follicles, teeth, sweat glands, and other ectodermal structures do not form properly, which leads to the characteristic features of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia. "
404,EDARADD ,EDAR associated death domain,"The EDARADD gene provides instructions for making a protein called the EDAR-associated death domain protein. This protein is part of a signaling pathway that plays an important role in development before birth. Specifically, it is critical for interactions between two embryonic cell layers called the ectoderm and the mesoderm. In the early embryo, these cell layers form the basis for many of the body's organs and tissues. Ectoderm-mesoderm interactions are essential for the formation of several structures that arise from the ectoderm, including the skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands.The EDARADD protein interacts with another protein, called the ectodysplasin A receptor, which is produced from the EDAR gene. This interaction occurs at a region called the death domain that is present in both proteins. The EDARADD protein acts as an adapter, which means it assists the ectodysplasin A receptor in triggering chemical signals within cells. These signals affect cell activities such as division, growth, and maturation. Starting before birth, this signaling pathway controls the formation of ectodermal structures such as hair follicles, sweat glands, and teeth.","Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia Fewer than 10 mutations in the EDARADD gene have been found to cause hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, the most common form of ectodermal dysplasia. Starting before birth, ectodermal dysplasias result in the abnormal development of the skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands. Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is characterized by a reduced ability to sweat (hypohidrosis), sparse scalp and body hair (hypotrichosis), and several missing teeth (hypodontia) or teeth that are malformed. EDARADD gene mutations are an infrequent cause of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, accounting for only about 1 percent of all cases.Most of the EDARADD gene mutations associated with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the receptor protein. These changes occur in or near the death domain, preventing the EDARADD protein from interacting effectively with the ectodysplasin A receptor. As a result, the receptor cannot trigger the signals needed for ectoderm-mesoderm interactions in early development. Without these signals, hair follicles, teeth, sweat glands, and other ectodermal structures do not form properly, which leads to the characteristic features of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia. "
405,EDN3 ,endothelin 3,"The EDN3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called endothelin 3. Proteins in the endothelin family are produced in various cells and tissues, where they are involved in the development and function of blood vessels, the production of certain hormones, and the stimulation of cell growth and division.Endothelin 3 functions by interacting with another protein, endothelin receptor type B (produced from the EDNRB gene), on the surface of cells. During early development before birth, endothelin 3 and endothelin receptor type B together play an important role in neural crest cells. These cells migrate from the developing spinal cord to specific regions in the embryo, where they give rise to many different types of cells. In particular, endothelin 3 and its receptor are essential for the formation of nerves in the intestine (enteric nerves) and for the production of specialized cells called melanocytes. Melanocytes produce melanin, a pigment that contributes to skin, hair, and eye color. Melanin is also involved in the normal function of the inner ear.","Hirschsprung disease About 10 mutations in the EDN3 gene have been found to cause Hirschsprung disease, a disorder that causes severe constipation or blockage of the intestine. Although Hirschsprung disease is a feature of another disorder called Waardenburg syndrome type IV (described below), EDN3 gene mutations can also cause Hirschsprung disease in people without Waardenburg syndrome. These mutations change one DNA building block (nucleotide) or insert an additional nucleotide in the gene. Changes in the EDN3 gene disrupt the normal function of endothelin 3, preventing it from playing its usual role in the development of enteric nerves. As a result, these cells do not form normally during embryonic development. A lack of enteric nerves prevents stool from being moved through the intestine normally, leading to severe constipation or intestinal blockage. "
406,EDNRB ,endothelin receptor type B,"The EDNRB gene provides instructions for making a protein called endothelin receptor type B. This protein is located on the surface of cells and functions as a signaling mechanism, transmitting information from outside the cell to inside the cell. The receptor interacts with proteins called endothelins to regulate several critical biological processes, including the development and function of blood vessels, the production of certain hormones, and the stimulation of cell growth and division.Endothelin 3 (produced from the EDN3 gene) is one of the proteins that interacts with endothelin receptor type B. During early development before birth (embryonic development), endothelin 3 and endothelin receptor type B together play an important role in neural crest cells. These cells migrate from the developing spinal cord to specific regions in the embryo, where they give rise to many different types of cells. In particular, endothelin 3 and endothelin receptor type B are essential for the formation of nerves in the intestine (enteric nerves) and for the production of specialized cells called melanocytes. Melanocytes produce melanin, a pigment that contributes to skin, hair, and eye color. Melanin is also involved in the normal function of the inner ear.","Hirschsprung disease More than 30 mutations in the EDNRB gene have been found to cause Hirschsprung disease, a disorder that causes severe constipation or blockage of the intestine. Although Hirschsprung disease is a feature of another condition called Waardenburg syndrome type IV (described below), EDNRB gene mutations can also cause Hirschsprung disease in people without Waardenburg syndrome. People with a mutation in one of the two copies of the EDNRB gene tend to develop Hirschsprung disease, while people with mutations in both copies of the gene usually develop Waardenburg syndrome type IV. Most of these mutations change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the gene. Changes in the EDNRB gene disrupt the normal function of endothelin receptor type B, preventing it from playing its usual role in the development of enteric nerves. As a result, these cells do not form normally during embryonic development. A lack of enteric nerves prevents stool from being moved through the intestine normally, leading to severe constipation or intestinal blockage. "
407,EFEMP2 ,EGF containing fibulin extracellular matrix protein 2,"The EFEMP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called EGF-containing fibulin extracellular matrix protein 2, which is also known as fibulin-4. This protein is part of a group of proteins called fibulins. Fibulins have a variety of functions in the extracellular matrix, which is the intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells.Little is known about the function of fibulin-4 in the extracellular matrix. It appears to play a critical role in the assembly of elastic fibers, which are slender bundles of protein that provide strength and flexibility to connective tissue (tissue that supports the body's joints and organs). Fibulin-4 is found in tissues and organs that are rich in elastic fibers, including the blood vessels, heart valves, lungs, and skin.","Cutis laxa At least three mutations in the EFEMP2 gene have been identified in people with cutis laxa. EFEMP2 mutations cause a form of the disorder called autosomal recessive cutis laxa type I, which is characterized by loose and sagging skin, a lung disease called emphysema, and severe abnormalities involving the heart and blood vessels.Mutations in the EFEMP2 gene likely prevent cells from producing any functional fibulin-4. Without this protein, elastic fibers cannot be assembled normally in the extracellular matrix. A shortage of normal elastic fibers weakens connective tissue in the skin, blood vessels, lungs, and other organs. These defects in connective tissue underlie the major features of cutis laxa. "
408,EFHC1 ,EF-hand domain containing 1,"The EFHC1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called EF-hand domain containing protein 1 (EFHC1). The EFHC1 protein interacts with another protein that acts as a calcium channel, allowing positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) to cross the cell membrane. The movement of these ions is critical for normal signaling between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and other parts of the nervous system. The role of the EFHC1 protein is not well understood, although it is thought to help regulate the balance of calcium ions inside the cell (calcium homeostasis). Studies also show that the EFHC1 protein may stimulate the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).","Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy Mutations in the EFHC1 gene have been identified in a small number of people with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. This condition typically begins in childhood or adolescence and causes recurrent myoclonic seizures, which are characterized by rapid, uncontrolled muscle jerks. Affected individuals can also have other types of seizures called generalized tonic-clonic seizures (or grand mal seizures) and absence seizures. Most gene mutations associated with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the EFHC1 protein. The function of the altered protein is thought to be reduced. Although it is unclear how EFHC1 gene mutations lead to juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, researchers have suggested that a decrease in EFHC1 protein function reduces apoptosis, leading to more neurons than normal, and disrupts calcium homeostasis. Together, these changes may lead to overstimulation of the neurons, causing seizures characteristic of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. "
409,EFNB1 ,ephrin B1,"The EFNB1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ephrin B1. This protein spans the membrane that surrounds the cell. The portion outside the cell attaches (binds) to proteins called Eph receptor kinases on the surface of neighboring cells. Together, these proteins form Eph/ephrin complexes, which help cells stick to one another (cell adhesion) and communicate. Communication between the attached cells plays a critical role in the normal shaping (patterning) of many tissues and organs before birth. In the brain, Eph/ephrin complexes also play a part in the development of nerve cells (neurons) and in the ability of the connections between neurons (synapses) to change and adapt over time in response to experience (synaptic plasticity).","Craniofrontonasal syndrome More than 115 mutations in the EFNB1 gene have been found to cause craniofrontonasal syndrome. This rare condition is characterized by the premature closure of certain bones of the skull (craniosynostosis) during development, which affects the shape of the head and face. Females with craniofrontonasal syndrome typically have more severe signs and symptoms than affected males, who often have one or two features of the condition.Mutations in the EFNB1 gene result in a shortage (deficiency) of ephrin B1 protein. Most of these mutations lead to an abnormally short version of the molecule that acts as the genetic blueprint used to make the ephrin B1 protein. The shortened molecules are quickly broken down before protein can be produced. A deficiency of ephrin B1 protein prevents the adhesion and communication between cells that aids in proper development , which disrupts normal patterning in tissues before birth. Abnormal development of the skull and other facial structures leads to the signs and symptoms of craniofrontonasal syndrome. "
410,EFTUD2 ,elongation factor Tu GTP binding domain containing 2,"The EFTUD2 gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of two complexes called the major and minor spliceosomes. Spliceosomes help process messenger RNA (mRNA), which is a chemical cousin of DNA that serves as a genetic blueprint for making proteins. The spliceosomes recognize and then remove regions called introns to help produce mature mRNA molecules.","Mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly More than 50 EFTUD2 gene mutations have been identified in people who have mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly (MFDM). This disorder causes malformations of the head and face, intellectual disability, and abnormalities affecting other areas of the body. These abnormalities include esophageal atresia, which is a blockage of the esophagus, and tracheoesophageal fistula, which is an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the trachea that allows fluids from the esophagus to get into the airways and interfere with breathing.The EFTUD2 gene mutations that cause MFDM result in the production of little or no functional enzyme from one copy of the gene in each cell. A shortage of this enzyme likely impairs mRNA processing. The relationship between these mutations and the specific symptoms of MFDM is not well understood. "
411,EGFR ,epidermal growth factor receptor,"The EGFR gene provides instructions for making a receptor protein called the epidermal growth factor receptor, which spans the cell membrane so that one end of the protein remains inside the cell and the other end projects from the outer surface of the cell. This positioning allows the receptor to attach (bind) to other proteins, called ligands, outside the cell and to receive signals that help the cell respond to its environment. Ligands and receptors fit together like keys into locks. Epidermal growth factor receptor binds to at least seven different ligands. The binding of a ligand to epidermal growth factor receptor allows the receptor to attach to another nearby epidermal growth factor receptor protein (dimerize), turning on (activating) the receptor complex. As a result, signaling pathways within the cell are triggered that promote cell growth and division (proliferation) and cell survival.","Lung cancer At least eight mutations in the EGFR gene have been associated with lung cancer. Lung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Lung cancer may not cause signs or symptoms in its early stages. Nearly all these EGFR gene mutations occur during a person's lifetime (somatic) and are present only in cancer cells.Somatic mutations in the EGFR gene most often occur in a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer, specifically a form called adenocarcinoma. These mutations are most common in people with the disease who have never smoked. Somatic EGFR gene mutations occur more frequently in Asian populations than in white populations, occurring in 30 to 40 percent of affected Asians compared to 10 to 15 percent of whites with lung cancer.Most of the somatic EGFR gene mutations that are associated with lung cancer delete genetic material in a part of the gene known as exon 19 or change DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in another region called exon 21. These gene changes result in a receptor protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated), even when it is not bound to a ligand. As a result, cells constantly receive signals to proliferate and survive, leading to tumor formation. When these genetic changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer can develop. Additional genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors contribute to a person's cancer risk.Lung cancers with EGFR gene mutations tend to respond to treatments that specifically target the overactive epidermal growth factor receptor protein that allows cancer cells to constantly grow and divide. "
412,EGLN1 ,egl-9 family hypoxia inducible factor 1,"The EGLN1 gene, often known as PHD2, provides instructions for making an enzyme called prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 (PHD2). The PHD2 enzyme interacts with a protein called hypoxia-inducible factor 2-alpha (HIF-2α). This protein is one part (subunit) of a larger HIF protein complex that plays a critical role in the body's ability to adapt to changing oxygen levels. HIF controls several important genes involved in cell division, the formation of new blood vessels, and the production of red blood cells. It is the major regulator of a hormone called erythropoietin, which controls red blood cell production.The PHD2 enzyme's primary job is to target HIF-2α to be broken down (degraded) so it does not build up when it is not needed. When enough oxygen is available, the PHD2 enzyme is highly active to stimulate the breakdown of HIF-2α. However, when oxygen levels are lower than normal (hypoxia), the PHD2 enzyme becomes less active. As a result, HIF-2α is degraded more slowly, leaving more HIF available to stimulate the formation of new blood vessels and red blood cells. These activities help maximize the amount of oxygen that can be delivered to the body's organs and tissues.Studies suggest that the EGLN1 gene is involved in the body's adaptation to high altitude. At higher altitudes, such as in mountainous regions, air pressure is lower and less oxygen enters the body through the lungs. Over time, the body compensates for the lower oxygen levels by changing breathing patterns and producing more red blood cells and blood vessels.Researchers suspect that the EGLN1 gene may also act as a tumor suppressor gene because of its role in regulating cell division and other processes through its interaction with HIF. Tumor suppressors prevent cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way, which could lead to the development of a tumor.","Familial erythrocytosis At least 10 mutations in the EGLN1 gene have been found to cause familial erythrocytosis, an inherited condition characterized by an increased number of red blood cells and an elevated risk of abnormal blood clots. When familial erythrocytosis results from EGLN1 gene mutations, it is often designated ECYT3.Some EGLN1 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the PHD2 enzyme, while others lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the enzyme. Any of these genetic changes disrupt the enzyme's ability to interact with HIF-2α and target it for destruction. Consequently, HIF accumulates in cells even when adequate oxygen is available. The presence of extra HIF leads to the production of red blood cells when no more are needed, resulting in an excess of these cells in the bloodstream.At least one of the known EGLN1 gene mutations has been associated with both familial erythrocytosis and a tumor called a paraganglioma in the same individual. Paragangliomas are noncancerous (benign) tumors of the nervous system. The mutation, written as His374Arg or H374R, replaces the amino acid histidine with the amino acid arginine at position 374 in the PHD2 enzyme. This genetic change alters the interaction between the PHD2 enzyme and HIF-2α, which leads to the production of excess red blood cells. However, it is unclear how the mutation may be associated with the development of paragangliomas. "
413,EHMT1 ,euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 1,"The EHMT1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called euchromatic histone methyltransferase 1. Histone methyltransferases are enzymes that modify proteins called histones. Histones are structural proteins that attach (bind) to DNA and give chromosomes their shape. By adding a molecule called a methyl group to histones, histone methyltransferases can turn off (suppress) the activity of certain genes, which is essential for normal development and function.","Kleefstra syndrome Kleefstra syndrome, a disorder affecting many parts of the body, is caused by the loss of the EHMT1 gene or by mutations that disable its function.Most people with Kleefstra syndrome are missing a sequence of about 1 million DNA building blocks (base pairs) on one copy of chromosome 9 in each cell. The deletion occurs near the end of the long (q) arm of the chromosome at a location designated q34.3, a region containing the EHMT1 gene. Some affected individuals have shorter or longer deletions in the same region.The loss of the EHMT1 gene from one copy of chromosome 9 in each cell is believed to be responsible for the characteristic features of Kleefstra syndrome in people with the 9q34.3 deletion. However, the loss of other genes in the same region may lead to additional health problems in some affected individuals.About 25 percent of individuals with Kleefstra syndrome do not have a deletion of genetic material from chromosome 9; instead, these individuals have mutations in the EHMT1 gene. Some of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in euchromatic histone methyltransferase 1. Others create a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the enzyme or alter the way the gene's instructions are pieced together to produce the enzyme. These changes generally result in an enzyme that is unstable and decays rapidly, or that is disabled and cannot function properly.Either a deletion or a mutation affecting the EHMT1 gene results in a lack of functional euchromatic histone methyltransferase 1 enzyme. A lack of this enzyme impairs proper control of the activity of certain genes in many of the body's organs and tissues, resulting in the abnormalities of development and function characteristic of Kleefstra syndrome. "
414,EIF2AK4 ,eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4,"The EIF2AK4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps direct a cell's response to changes that could damage the cell. This protein is found in several tissues throughout the body, including blood vessel walls. The EIF2AK4 protein can turn on (activate) another protein called eIF2 alpha (eIF2α), which helps control protein production. When cells are under stress, for example when the level of protein building blocks (amino acids) is too low, EIF2AK4 activates eIF2α. When turned on, eIF2α stimulates processes that reduce protein production, which helps conserve amino acids. In addition, activated eIF2α can trigger production of certain proteins called transcription factors, which control gene activity. The transcription factors regulated by eIF2α control the activity of genes involved in processes that help reduce the stress on the cell.","Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease Mutations in the EIF2AK4 gene are the primary genetic cause of a condition called pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD); at least 22 mutations in this gene have been found in affected individuals. In PVOD, excess fibrous tissue builds up in the small vessels in the lungs that carry oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart (the pulmonary veins). This buildup narrows (occludes) the vessels and impairs blood flow. Because blood flow through the lungs is difficult, pressure rises in the vessels that carry blood that needs to be oxygenated to the lungs from the heart (pulmonary arteries). Increased pressure in these vessels is known as pulmonary arterial hypertension.The EIF2AK4 gene mutations involved in PVOD likely lead to a complete loss of functional protein. It is not known how absence of EIF2AK4 protein function leads to the pulmonary vein abnormalities characteristic of PVOD. "
415,EIF2B1 ,eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B subunit alpha,"The EIF2B1 gene provides instructions for making one of five parts of a protein called eIF2B, specifically the alpha subunit of this protein. The eIF2B protein helps regulate overall protein production (synthesis) in the cell by interacting with another protein, eIF2. The eIF2 protein is called an initiation factor because it is involved in starting (initiating) protein synthesis.Under some conditions, eIF2B increases protein synthesis by helping to recycle molecules called GTP, which carry energy to the initiation factor. Under other conditions, it slows protein synthesis by binding tightly to the initiation factor, which converts the eIF2B protein into an inactive form and prevents recycling of GTP.Proper regulation of protein synthesis is vital for ensuring that the correct levels of protein are available for the cell to cope with changing conditions. For example, cells must synthesize protein much faster if they are multiplying than if they are in a resting state.","Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter Mutations in the EIF2B1 gene have been identified in a few people with leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter. These mutations cause partial loss of eIF2B function. Impairment of eIF2B function makes it more difficult for the body's cells to regulate protein synthesis and deal with changing conditions and stress. Researchers believe that cells in the white matter (nerve fibers covered by a fatty substance called myelin that insulates and protects nerves) may be particularly affected by an abnormal response to stress, resulting in the signs and symptoms of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter. "
416,EIF2B2 ,eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B subunit beta,"The EIF2B2 gene provides instructions for making one of five parts of a protein called eIF2B, specifically the beta subunit of this protein. The eIF2B protein helps regulate overall protein production (synthesis) in the cell by interacting with another protein, eIF2. The eIF2 protein is called an initiation factor because it is involved in starting (initiating) protein synthesis.Under some conditions, eIF2B increases protein synthesis by helping to recycle molecules called GTP, which carry energy to the initiation factor. Under other conditions, it slows protein synthesis by binding tightly to the initiation factor, which converts the eIF2B protein into an inactive form and prevents recycling of GTP.Proper regulation of protein synthesis is vital for ensuring that the correct levels of protein are available for the cell to cope with changing conditions. For example, cells must synthesize protein much faster if they are multiplying than if they are in a resting state.","Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter Mutations in the EIF2B2 gene have been identified in a few people with leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter, including some affected females with a variant of the disorder in which the neurological features are accompanied by ovarian failure (ovarioleukodystrophy). These mutations cause partial loss of eIF2B function. Impairment of eIF2B function makes it more difficult for the body's cells to regulate protein synthesis and deal with changing conditions and stress. Researchers believe that cells in the white matter (nerve fibers covered by a fatty substance called myelin that insulates and protects nerves) may be particularly affected by an abnormal response to stress, resulting in the signs and symptoms of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter. "
417,EIF2B3 ,eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B subunit gamma,"The EIF2B3 gene provides instructions for making one of five parts of a protein called eIF2B, specifically the gamma subunit of this protein. The eIF2B protein helps regulate overall protein production (synthesis) in the cell by interacting with another protein, eIF2. The eIF2 protein is called an initiation factor because it is involved in starting (initiating) protein synthesis.Under some conditions, eIF2B increases protein synthesis by helping to recycle molecules called GTP, which carry energy to the initiation factor. Under other conditions, it slows protein synthesis by binding tightly to the initiation factor, which converts the eIF2B protein into an inactive form and prevents recycling of GTP.Proper regulation of protein synthesis is vital for ensuring that the correct levels of protein are available for the cell to cope with changing conditions.

These mutations cause partial loss of eIF2B function. Impairment of eIF2B function makes it more difficult for the body's cells to regulate protein synthesis and deal with changing conditions and stress. Researchers believe that cells in the white matter (nerve fibers covered by a fatty substance called myelin that insulates and protects nerves) may be particularly affected by an abnormal response to stress, resulting in the signs and symptoms of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter. "
418,EIF2B4 ,eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B subunit delta,"The EIF2B4 gene provides instructions for making one of five parts of a protein called eIF2B, specifically the delta subunit of this protein. The eIF2B protein helps regulate overall protein production (synthesis) in the cell by interacting with another protein, eIF2. The eIF2 protein is called an initiation factor because it is involved in starting (initiating) protein synthesis.Under some conditions, eIF2B increases protein synthesis by helping to recycle molecules called GTP, which carry energy to the initiation factor. Under other conditions, it slows protein synthesis by binding tightly to the initiation factor, which converts the eIF2B protein into an inactive form and prevents recycling of GTP.Proper regulation of protein synthesis is vital for ensuring that the correct levels of protein are available for the cell to cope with changing conditions. For example, cells must synthesize protein much faster if they are multiplying than if they are in a resting state.","Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter Mutations in the EIF2B4 gene have been identified in a few people with leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter, including some affected females with a variant of the disorder in which the neurological features are accompanied by ovarian failure (ovarioleukodystrophy). These mutations cause partial loss of eIF2B function.

Researchers believe that cells in the white matter (nerve fibers covered by a fatty substance called myelin that insulates and protects nerves) may be particularly affected by an abnormal response to stress, resulting in the signs and symptoms of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter. "
419,EIF2B5 ,eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B subunit epsilon,"The EIF2B5 gene provides instructions for making one of five parts of a protein called eIF2B, specifically the epsilon subunit of this protein. The eIF2B protein helps regulate overall protein production (synthesis) in the cell by interacting with another protein, eIF2. The eIF2 protein is called an initiation factor because it is involved in starting (initiating) protein synthesis.Under some conditions, eIF2B increases protein synthesis by helping to recycle molecules called GTP, which carry energy to the initiation factor. Under other conditions, it slows protein synthesis by binding tightly to the initiation factor, which converts the eIF2B protein into an inactive form and prevents recycling of GTP.Proper regulation of protein synthesis is vital for ensuring that the correct levels of protein are available for the cell to cope with changing conditions. For example, cells must synthesize protein much faster if they are multiplying than if they are in a resting state.","Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter Mutations in the EIF2B5 gene have been identified in about 65 percent of people with leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter, including those with a severe, early-onset form that is seen among the Cree and Chippewayan populations of Quebec and Manitoba (Cree leukoencephalopathy) and some affected females with a variant of the disorder in which the neurological features are accompanied by ovarian failure (ovarioleukodystrophy). These mutations cause partial loss of eIF2B function. Impairment of eIF2B function makes it more difficult for the body's cells to regulate protein synthesis and deal with changing conditions and stress. Researchers believe that cells in the white matter (nerve fibers covered by a fatty substance called myelin that insulates and protects nerves) may be particularly affected by an abnormal response to stress, resulting in the signs and symptoms of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter. "
420,ELANE ,"elastase, neutrophil expressed","The ELANE gene provides instructions for making a protein called neutrophil elastase. This protein is found in neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that plays a role in inflammation and in fighting infection. When the body starts an immune response to fight an infection, neutrophils release neutrophil elastase. This protein then modifies the function of certain cells and proteins to fight the infection.","Cyclic neutropenia More than 15 mutations in the ELANE gene have been found to cause cyclic neutropenia, a condition characterized by episodes of neutrophil shortages (neutropenia) and increased risk of infection. ELANE gene mutations that cause cyclic neutropenia change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in neutrophil elastase. These mutations are thought to create an abnormal protein that retains some function. However, neutrophils that produce abnormal neutrophil elastase proteins appear to have a shorter lifespan than normal. The shorter neutrophil lifespan is thought to be responsible for the cyclic nature of this condition. When the affected neutrophils die early, there is a period in which there is a shortage of neutrophils because it takes time for the body to replenish its supply. For most affected individuals, neutropenia recurs every 21 days. "
421,ELN ,elastin,"The ELN gene provides instructions for making a protein called tropoelastin. Multiple copies of the tropoelastin protein attach to one another and are processed to form a mature protein called elastin. Elastin is the major component of elastic fibers, which are slender bundles of proteins that provide strength and flexibility to connective tissue (tissue that supports the body's joints and organs). Elastic fibers are found in the intricate lattice that forms in the spaces between cells (the extracellular matrix), where they give structural support to organs and tissues such as the heart, skin, lungs, ligaments, and blood vessels.","Cutis laxa At least 16 mutations in the ELN gene have been identified in people with a skin disorder called cutis laxa. ELN gene mutations cause a form of the disorder called autosomal dominant cutis laxa, which is characterized by loose, sagging skin; an increased risk of an abnormal bulging (an aneurysm) in a large blood vessel called the aorta; and a lung disease called emphysema, which can make it difficult to breathe.The ELN mutations that cause autosomal dominant cutis laxa lead to the production of an abnormally long version of the tropoelastin protein. The abnormal protein likely interferes with the formation of mature elastin and the assembly of elastic fibers, which weakens connective tissue in the skin and blood vessels. This defect in connective tissue underlies the major features of cutis laxa. "
422,ELOVL4 ,ELOVL fatty acid elongase 4,"The ELOVL4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found primarily in the retina, the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. Within the retina, the ELOVL4 protein is produced in specialized light receptor cells (photoreceptors). The ELOVL4 protein is also found in the brain and skin, but less is known about its activity (expression) in these structures.Inside photoreceptor cells, this protein is located in a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum that is involved in protein production, processing, and transport. The ELOVL4 protein plays a role in making a group of fats called very long-chain fatty acids. The protein helps add carbon molecules to long-chain fatty acids, making them very long-chain fatty acids. The function of the very long-chain fatty acids produced by the ELOVL4 protein is unknown.","Stargardt macular degeneration At least three mutations in the ELOVL4 gene have been found to cause Stargardt macular degeneration. These mutations create a premature stop signal in the instructions used to make the ELOVL4 protein. As a result, the protein cannot be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum of photoreceptor cells. Instead, the ELOVL4 protein forms clumps (aggregates). These aggregates cannot make very long-chain fatty acids and may interfere with cell functions, ultimately leading to cell death. The loss of photoreceptor cells causes progressive vision loss in people with Stargardt macular degeneration. Mutations in the ELOVL4 gene are a rare cause of this condition. "
423,ELP1 ,elongator complex protein 1,"The ELP1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called elongator complex protein 1 (ELP1). This protein is found in a variety of cells throughout the body, including brain cells. It is part of a six-protein complex called the elongator complex. The elongator complex plays a key role in transcription, the process that transfers information in genes to the cell machinery that makes proteins. Researchers believe that the elongator complex is important for the transcription of proteins that affect the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton) and cell movement (motility). The cytoskeleton and cell motility are essential for the growth and development of cells. For example, the cytoskeleton plays a critical role in the growth of nerve cells, particularly the specialized extensions called axons and dendrites that are required for the transmission of nerve impulses. Cell motility is crucial for the movement of nerve cells to their proper locations in the brain.","Familial dysautonomia Nearly all individuals with familial dysautonomia have two copies of the same mutation in each cell. This mutation can disrupt how information in the ELP1 gene is spliced together during transcription. As a result of this splicing error, a reduced amount of ELP1 protein is produced. This mutation behaves inconsistently, however. Some cells produce near normal amounts of ELP1 protein, and other cells—particularly brain cells—have very little of the protein.In a small number of reported familial dysautonomia cases, researchers have identified other mutations that change one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ELP1 protein. In these cases, the amino acid arginine is replaced by the amino acid proline at position 696 (written as Arg696Pro), or the amino acid proline is replaced by the amino acid leucine at position 914 (written as Pro914Leu). People with one of these improper amino acid substitutions also have the splicing mutation. Together, these mutations impair the ELP1 protein.It is unclear how ELP1 gene mutations lead to the signs and symptoms of familial dysautonomia. Reduced amounts of ELP1 protein may impair the growth and development of nerve cells by disrupting the cytoskeleton and cell motility. "
424,EMD ,emerin,"The EMD gene provides instructions for making a protein called emerin. Although this protein is produced in many tissues, it appears to be particularly important for the normal function of muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles) and the heart (cardiac muscle).Within cells, emerin is a component of the nuclear envelope. The nuclear envelope is a structure that surrounds the nucleus, acting as a barrier between the nucleus and the surrounding fluid (cytoplasm) inside the cell. The nuclear envelope has several functions, including regulating the movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus.Emerin interacts with several other proteins on the inner surface of the nuclear envelope. Together, these proteins are involved in regulating the activity of certain genes, controlling cell division and chemical signaling, and maintaining the structure and stability of the nucleus. Emerin and related proteins also play a role in assembling the nucleus during the process of cell division.","Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy More than 100 mutations in the EMD gene have been reported in people with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. This condition affects skeletal and cardiac muscle, causing joint deformities called contractures, which restrict the movement of certain joints; muscle weakness and wasting that worsen over time; and heart problems, including an increased risk of sudden death.Almost all of the EMD gene mutations prevent cells from producing any emerin protein. Researchers have not determined how a lack of this protein leads to the skeletal and cardiac muscle abnormalities characteristic of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Studies suggest, however, that an absence of emerin could disrupt the functions of other proteins in the nuclear envelope. These changes may alter the activity of certain genes or weaken the structure of the nucleus, making cells more fragile.In rare cases, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy results from EMD mutations that change a single building block (amino acid) in the emerin protein. These mutations lead to the production of an abnormal version of emerin that is unable to interact with other proteins or cannot be correctly inserted into the nuclear envelope. This type of mutation may be responsible for some cases of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy with unusually mild signs and symptoms. "
425,EMG1 ,"EMG1, N1-specific pseudouridine methyltransferase","The EMG1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the production of cellular structures called ribosomes, which process the cell's genetic instructions to create new proteins. Ribosomes are assembled in a cell compartment called the nucleolus.The EMG1 protein is involved in the assembly of a part of the ribosome called the small subunit (SSU). In this role, the EMG1 protein functions as part of a protein complex called the SSU processome. In addition to helping to assemble the SSU, the SSU processome is involved in the maturation of a molecule called 18S rRNA, which is a chemical cousin of DNA that is incorporated into the SSU.","Bowen-Conradi syndrome An EMG1 gene mutation common in the Hutterite population of the United States and Canada causes Bowen-Conradi syndrome, a disorder that affects many parts of the body and is usually fatal in the first few months of life. The mutation that causes Bowen-Conradi syndrome, written as Asp86Gly or D86G, changes the protein building block (amino acid) aspartic acid to the amino acid glycine at position 86 in the EMG1 protein. Studies suggest that the mutation makes the protein unstable, resulting in a decrease in the amount of EMG1 protein that is available in the nucleolus. A shortage of this protein in the nucleolus would impair ribosome production, which may reduce cell growth and division (proliferation); however, it is unknown how EMG1 gene mutations lead to the particular signs and symptoms of Bowen-Conradi syndrome. "
426,ENAM ,enamelin,"The ENAM gene provides instructions for making a protein called enamelin, which is essential for normal tooth development. Enamelin is involved in the formation of enamel, which is the hard, white material that forms the protective outer layer of each tooth. Enamel is composed mainly of mineral crystals. These microscopic crystals are arranged in organized bundles that give enamel its strength and durability. Although the exact function of enamelin is not well understood, this protein plays a key role in the formation and growth of crystals in developing enamel.","Amelogenesis imperfecta At least 14 mutations in the ENAM gene have been identified in people with a disorder of tooth development called amelogenesis imperfecta. Mutations in this gene cause autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of this condition.In the autosomal dominant form, one copy of the ENAM gene in each cell is altered. These mutations have a variety of effects on enamel formation. Some of these mutations reduce the amount of enamelin produced from one copy of the gene. Other mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short version of enamelin that is missing critical regions. A reduced amount of enamelin or an altered version of the protein can lead to severe problems with developing enamel or cause milder defects such as shallow pits or horizontal grooves in the teeth.In the autosomal recessive form of amelogenesis imperfecta, two copies of the ENAM gene in each cell are altered. These mutations result in the production of an abnormal version of enamelin that prevents enamel from developing properly. People who inherit two mutated copies of the ENAM gene have severe defects in their enamel; as a result, this protective covering may be very thin or completely absent. "
427,ENG ,endoglin,"The ENG gene provides instructions for making a protein called endoglin. This protein is found on the surface of cells, especially in the lining of developing arteries. It forms a complex with growth factors and other proteins involved in the development of blood vessels. In particular, this complex is involved in the specialization of new blood vessels into arteries or veins.","Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia Dozens of mutations in the ENG gene have been found to cause hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1. Many ENG gene mutations substitute one protein building block (amino acid) for another amino acid in the endoglin protein, which impairs the protein's function. Other mutations prevent production of the endoglin protein or result in an abnormally small protein that cannot function. The shortage of functional endoglin appears to interfere with the development of boundaries between arteries and veins, resulting in the signs and symptoms of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1. "
428,ENPP1 ,ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1,"The ENPP1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1). The ENPP1 protein helps break down a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP), specifically when it is found outside the cell (extracellular). Extracellular ATP is quickly broken down into other molecules called adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate. Pyrophosphate is important in preventing the accumulation of abnormal deposits of calcium (calcification) and other minerals (mineralization) in the body.The ENPP1 protein also plays a role in controlling cell signaling in response to the hormone insulin, through interaction between a part of the ENPP1 protein called the SMB2 domain and the insulin receptor. The insulin receptor is a protein that attaches (binds) to insulin and initiates cell signaling.Insulin plays many roles in the body, including regulating blood sugar levels by controlling how much sugar (in the form of glucose) is passed from the bloodstream into cells to be used as energy. Cell signaling in response to insulin is also important for the maintenance of the outer layer of skin (the epidermis). It helps control the transport of the pigment melanin from the cells in which it is produced (melanocytes) to epidermal cells called keratinocytes, and it is also involved in the development of keratinocytes.","Cole disease At least three ENPP1 gene mutations have been identified in people with Cole disease. People with this disorder have areas of unusually light-colored skin (hypopigmentation), typically on the arms and legs, and spots of thickened skin on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet (punctate palmoplantar keratoderma).The ENPP1 gene mutations that cause Cole disease change the structure of the SMB2 domain, which alters its interaction with the insulin receptor and affects cell signaling. The resulting impairment of ENPP1's role in melanin transport and keratinocyte development leads to hypopigmentation and keratoderma. The mutations may also impair the protein's ability to control calcification, which likely accounts for the abnormal calcium deposits that occur in some people with this disorder. For reasons that are unclear, the changes in insulin signaling resulting from these ENPP1 gene mutations do not seem to affect blood sugar control. "
429,EOGT ,EGF domain specific O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase,"The EOGT gene provides instructions for making a protein that modifies certain other proteins by transferring a molecule called N-acetylglucosamine to them. This change, called an O-GlcNAc modification, can affect protein stability and regulate several cellular processes, such as signaling in cells and the first step in the production of proteins from genes (transcription). Little is known about the proteins altered by the EOGT protein or what effect the O-GlcNAc modification has on them. Studies suggest that Notch proteins may be modified by EOGT. Notch proteins stimulate signaling pathways important during the development of several tissues throughout the body, including the bones, heart, liver, muscles, and blood cells, among others.","Adams-Oliver syndrome At least three mutations in the EOGT gene have been found in individuals with Adams-Oliver syndrome. This condition is characterized by areas of missing skin (aplasia cutis congenita), usually on the scalp, and malformations of the hands and feet. The most common EOGT gene mutation involved in this condition, which is found in the Arab population, leads to an abnormally short protein. The other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the EOGT protein. Research suggests that the EOGT gene mutations reduce or eliminate the protein's ability to transfer N-acetylglucosamine. It is unknown what effect this impairment has on cells or how it leads to the features of Adams-Oliver syndrome. "
430,EP300 ,E1A binding protein p300,"The EP300 gene provides instructions for making a protein called p300, which regulates the activity of many genes in tissues throughout the body. This protein plays an essential role in controlling cell growth and division and prompting cells to mature and take on specialized functions (differentiate). The p300 protein appears to be critical for normal development before and after birth.The p300 protein carries out its functions by turning on (activating) transcription, which is the first step in the production of protein from the instructions stored in DNA. The p300 protein ensures the DNA is ready for transcription by attaching a small molecule called an acetyl group (a process called acetylation) to proteins called histones. Histones are structural proteins that bind DNA and give chromosomes their shape. Acetylation of the histone changes the shape of the chromosome, making genes available for transcription. On the basis of this function, the p300 protein is called a histone acetyltransferase.In addition, the p300 protein connects other proteins that start the transcription process (known as transcription factors) with the group of proteins that carries out transcription. On the basis of this function, the p300 protein is called a transcriptional coactivator.","Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome More than 80 mutations in the EP300 gene have been identified in people with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, a condition characterized by short stature, moderate to severe intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and broad thumbs and first toes. Genetic changes in the EP300 gene cause a small percentage of cases of this condition. Some mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the p300 protein, while other mutations prevent one copy of the gene from making any protein at all. These genetic changes all result in the loss of one functional copy of the EP300 gene in each cell, which reduces the amount of p300 protein by half. Although researchers are uncertain how a reduction in the amount of this protein leads to the specific features of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, it is clear that changes in the EP300 gene disrupt normal development before and after birth. Problems with development of multiple systems are thought to underlie the features of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. "
431,EPAS1 ,endothelial PAS domain protein 1,"The EPAS1 gene, often known as HIF2A, provides instructions for making a protein called hypoxia-inducible factor 2-alpha (HIF-2α). This protein is one part (subunit) of a larger protein complex called HIF, which plays a critical role in the body's ability to adapt to changing oxygen levels. HIF controls several important genes involved in cell division, the formation of new blood vessels, and the production of red blood cells. It is the major regulator of a hormone called erythropoietin, which controls red blood cell production.HIF-2α is constantly produced in the body. When adequate oxygen is available, other proteins target HIF-2α to be broken down (degraded) so it does not build up. However, when oxygen levels are lower than normal (hypoxia), HIF-2α is degraded at a slower rate. Consequently, more HIF is available to stimulate the formation of new blood vessels and the production of red blood cells. These activities help maximize the amount of oxygen that can be delivered to the body's organs and tissues.Studies suggest that the EPAS1 gene is involved in the body's adaptation to high altitude. At higher altitudes, such as in mountainous regions, air pressure is lower and less oxygen enters the body through the lungs. Over time, the body compensates for the lower oxygen levels by changing breathing patterns and producing more red blood cells and blood vessels.","Familial erythrocytosis At least five mutations in the EPAS1 gene have been found to cause familial erythrocytosis, an inherited condition characterized by an increased number of red blood cells and an elevated risk of abnormal blood clots. When familial erythrocytosis results from EPAS1 gene mutations, it is often designated ECYT4.Mutations in the EPAS1 gene change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the HIF-2α protein. These changes prevent HIF-2α from interacting normally with the proteins that target it for degradation. As a result, HIF-2α is not degraded efficiently, and HIF accumulates in cells even when adequate oxygen is available. The presence of extra HIF leads to the production of red blood cells when no more are needed, resulting in an excess of these cells in the bloodstream. "
432,EPCAM ,epithelial cell adhesion molecule,"The EPCAM gene provides instructions for making a protein known as epithelial cellular adhesion molecule (EpCAM). This protein is found in epithelial cells, which are the cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body. The EpCAM protein is found spanning the membrane that surrounds epithelial cells, where it helps cells stick to one another (cell adhesion). In addition, the protein in the cell membrane can be cut at a specific location, releasing a piece called the intracellular domain (EpICD), which helps relay signals from outside the cell to the nucleus of the cell. EpICD travels to the nucleus and associates with other proteins, forming a group (complex) that regulates the activity of several genes that are involved in cell growth and division (proliferation), maturation (differentiation), and movement (migration), all of which are important processes for the proper development of cells and tissues.","Lynch syndrome Certain mutations in the EPCAM gene are associated with Lynch syndrome, a condition that increases the risk of developing many types of cancer, particularly cancers of the large intestine (colon) and the rectum (collectively called colorectal cancer). These mutations account for up to 6 percent of Lynch syndrome cases. On chromosome 2, the EPCAM gene lies next to another gene called MSH2. Each gene provides instructions for making an individual messenger RNA (mRNA), which serves as the genetic blueprint for making the protein. The EPCAM gene mutations involved in Lynch syndrome remove a region that signals the end of the gene, which leads to formation of a long mRNA that includes both EPCAM and MSH2.For unknown reasons, these EPCAM gene mutations cause the MSH2 gene to be turned off (inactivated) by a mechanism known as promoter hypermethylation. The promoter is a region of DNA near the beginning of the gene that controls gene activity (expression). Hypermethylation occurs when too many small molecules called methyl groups are attached to the promoter region. The extra methyl groups attached to the MSH2 promoter reduce the expression of the MSH2 gene, which means that less protein is produced in epithelial cells.The MSH2 protein plays an essential role in repairing errors in DNA; loss of this protein prevents proper DNA repair, and errors accumulate as the cells continue to divide. These errors can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and increase the risk of cancer. "
433,EPG5 ,ectopic P-granules autophagy protein 5 homolog,"The EPG5 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in a cellular process called autophagy. This process recycles worn-out or unnecessary cell parts and breaks down certain proteins when they are no longer needed. Autophagy also helps cells use materials most efficiently when energy demands are high. During autophagy, materials to be recycled or removed are isolated in compartments called autophagosomes. The autophagosomes are then transported to cell structures called lysosomes that break down the materials. The EPG5 protein is important for the interaction between autophagosomes and lysosomes that allows the transfer of materials.In addition to its role in autophagy, the EPG5 protein aids in the cell's ability to recognize infection from foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. The protein transports molecules from these invaders within cells so they can interact with immune system proteins that trigger reactions to fight the infection.","Vici syndrome At least 60 mutations in the EPG5 gene have been found to cause Vici syndrome, a severe condition that primarily affects the brain, immune system, heart, skin, and eyes. Most of these mutations lead to an abnormally short EPG5 protein that does not function. Without EPG5 protein activity, foreign invaders cannot trigger immune reactions, which leads to recurrent infections. In addition, autophagy is impaired. Researchers speculate that problems with autophagy disrupt the normal development and survival of cells in the brain and other organs and tissues that require large amounts of energy; however, they do not fully understand how the impairment leads to signs and symptoms of Vici syndrome. "
434,EPM2A ,"EPM2A, laforin glucan phosphatase","The EPM2A gene provides instructions for making a protein called laforin. Although this protein is active in cells throughout the body, it appears to play a critical role in the survival of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain.Studies suggest that laforin has multiple functions within cells. To carry out these functions, laforin interacts with several other proteins, including malin (which is produced from the NHLRC1 gene). These proteins are part of complex networks that transmit chemical signals and break down unneeded or abnormal proteins. Additionally, laforin may act as a tumor suppressor protein, which means that it keeps cells from growing and dividing in an uncontrolled way.Laforin and malin likely play a critical role in regulating the production of a complex sugar called glycogen. Glycogen is a major source of stored energy in the body. The body stores this sugar in the liver and muscles, breaking it down when it is needed for fuel. Researchers believe that laforin and malin may prevent a potentially damaging buildup of glycogen in tissues that do not normally store this molecule, such as those of the nervous system.","Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy More than 50 mutations in the EPM2A gene have been identified in people with Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Many of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the laforin protein. Other mutations delete or insert genetic material in the EPM2A gene. Almost all mutations in this gene prevent cells from producing any laforin or lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of the protein.It is unclear how mutations in the EPM2A gene lead to the major features of Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Studies suggest that a loss of laforin prevents cells from regulating the production of glycogen. As a result, distinctive clumps called Lafora bodies form within many types of cells. Lafora bodies are made up of an abnormal form of glycogen (called polyglucosan) that cannot be broken down and used for fuel. Instead, polyglucosans build up to form clumps that can damage cells. Neurons appear to be particularly vulnerable to this type of damage. Although Lafora bodies are found in many of the body's tissues, the signs and symptoms of Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy are limited to the nervous system.Researchers are uncertain how a loss of functional laforin contributes to the formation of Lafora bodies. However, a lack of this protein ultimately results in the death of neurons, which interferes with the brain's normal functions. The degeneration of neurons likely underlies the seizures, movement abnormalities, intellectual decline, and other neurological problems seen with Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy. "
435,EPOR ,erythropoietin receptor,"The EPOR gene provides instructions for making a protein called the erythropoietin receptor. Erythropoietin is a hormone that directs the production of new red blood cells (erythrocytes) in the bone marrow. Red blood cells make up about half of total blood volume, and their primary function is to carry oxygen from the lungs to tissues and organs throughout the body. New red blood cells are constantly being produced by the body as worn-out red blood cells are broken down. To trigger the production of red blood cells, erythropoietin attaches (binds) to the erythropoietin receptor. This binding turns on (activates) the receptor, which stimulates several signaling pathways (particularly a cascade of signals known as the JAK/STAT pathway) that lead to the formation and maturation of red blood cells.","Familial erythrocytosis At least 16 mutations in the EPOR gene have been found to cause familial erythrocytosis, an inherited condition characterized by an increased number of red blood cells and an elevated risk of abnormal blood clots. When familial erythrocytosis results from EPOR gene mutations, it is often designated ECYT1.Most of the identified mutations in the EPOR gene lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the erythropoietin receptor. A few mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the receptor. All of these mutations alter the structure of the receptor, causing it to remain activated for an abnormally long time after binding to erythropoietin. The overactive receptor signals the production of red blood cells even when no more are needed, which leads to an excess of these cells in the bloodstream. "
436,EPX ,eosinophil peroxidase,"The EPX gene provides instructions for making a protein called eosinophil peroxidase. This protein is found within certain white blood cells called eosinophils. During a normal immune response, eosinophils are activated (turned on), and they travel to the area of injury or inflammation. The cells then release proteins and other compounds that have a toxic effect on severely damaged cells or invading organisms. One of these proteins is called eosinophil peroxidase. This protein helps form molecules that are highly toxic to bacteria and parasites. These toxic molecules also play a role in regulating inflammation by fighting microbial invaders.The eosinophil peroxidase protein is produced as a long strand that is cut (cleaved) into two smaller pieces. The shorter piece is known as the light chain and the longer piece is known as the heavy chain. These two pieces are attached to each other to form functional eosinophil peroxidase.","Eosinophil peroxidase deficiency At least three mutations have been found to cause eosinophil peroxidase deficiency. This condition affects eosinophils but causes no health problems in affected individuals. These mutations reduce or prevent eosinophil peroxidase production or result in a protein that is unstable and nonfunctional. As a result, eosinophils have severely reduced amounts of eosinophil peroxidase or none at all. The cells lacking eosinophil peroxidase are smaller and may have structural changes, but the other proteins within affected eosinophils are normal and the loss of eosinophil peroxidase does not appear to impair the function of these cells. "
437,ERAP1 ,endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1,"The ERAP1 gene (also known as ERAAP and ARTS1) provides instructions for making a protein called endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1. As its name suggests, this protein is active in a cellular structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein processing and transport. This protein is an aminopeptidase, which is an enzyme that cuts (cleaves) other proteins into smaller fragments called peptides.Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 has two major functions, both of which are important for normal immune system function. First, endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 cleaves several proteins called cytokine receptors on the surface of cells. Cleaving these receptors reduces their ability to transmit chemical signals into the cell, which affects the process of inflammation.Second, endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 cleaves many types of proteins into small peptides that can be recognized by the immune system. These peptides are exported to the cell surface, where they attach to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins. MHC class I proteins display the peptides to the immune system. If the immune system recognizes the peptides as foreign (such as viral or bacterial peptides), it responds by triggering the infected cell to self-destruct.","Ankylosing spondylitis Several variations (polymorphisms) in the ERAP1 gene have been found to influence the risk of ankylosing spondylitis. Each of these variations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1. Little is known about the effects of these variations, although researchers believe that changes in the protein's structure could alter either of its two major functions. It is unclear how these changes contribute to a person's risk of ankylosing spondylitis. Other genetic and environmental factors, many of which are unknown, also affect the chance of developing this condition. "
438,ERCC2 ,"ERCC excision repair 2, TFIIH core complex helicase subunit","The ERCC2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called XPD. This protein is an essential part (subunit) of a group of proteins known as the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex. The TFIIH complex has two major functions: it is involved in a process called gene transcription, and it helps repair damaged DNA.Gene transcription is the first step in protein production. By controlling gene transcription, the TFIIH complex helps regulate the activity of many different genes. The XPD protein appears to stabilize the TFIIH complex. Studies suggest that the XPD protein works together with XPB, another protein in the TFIIH complex that is produced from the ERCC3 gene, to start (initiate) gene transcription.The TFIIH complex also plays an important role in repairing damaged DNA. DNA can be damaged by ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun and by toxic chemicals, radiation, and unstable molecules called free radicals. DNA damage occurs frequently, but normal cells are usually able to fix it before it can cause problems. One of the major mechanisms that cells use to fix DNA is known as nucleotide excision repair (NER). As part of this repair mechanism, the TFIIH complex separates the section of double-stranded DNA that surrounds the damage. The XPD protein helps with this process by acting as a helicase, which is an enzyme that attaches to particular regions of DNA and temporarily unwinds the two spiral strands. Once the damaged region has been exposed, other proteins snip out (excise) the abnormal section and replace the damaged area with the correct DNA.","Trichothiodystrophy At least 20 mutations in the ERCC2 gene have been found to cause trichothiodystrophy. Mutations in this gene are the most common cause of the photosensitive form of the condition, which is characterized by an extreme sensitivity to UV rays from sunlight.Studies suggest that the ERCC2 gene mutations responsible for trichothiodystrophy reduce the amount of functional TFIIH complex in cells. Without enough of this complex, cells cannot effectively repair DNA damage caused by UV radiation. These problems with DNA repair cause people with the photosensitive form of trichothiodystrophy to be extremely sensitive to sunlight. Other features of the condition, such as slow growth, intellectual disability, and brittle hair, probably result from problems with the transcription of genes needed for normal development before and after birth.Unlike xeroderma pigmentosum (described below), trichothiodystrophy is not associated with an increased risk of skin cancer. Researchers are working to determine why some mutations in the ERCC2 gene affect a person's cancer risk and others do not. "
439,ERCC3 ,"ERCC excision repair 3, TFIIH core complex helicase subunit","The ERCC3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called XPB. This protein is an essential part (subunit) of a group of proteins known as the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex. The TFIIH complex has two major functions: it is involved in a process called gene transcription, and it helps repair damaged DNA.Gene transcription is the first step in protein production.

One of the major mechanisms that cells use to fix DNA is known as nucleotide excision repair (NER). As part of this repair mechanism, the TFIIH complex unwinds the section of double-stranded DNA that surrounds the damage. Studies suggest that the XPB protein may act as a wedge, holding open the two strands of DNA so other proteins can snip out (excise) the abnormal section and replace the damaged area with the correct DNA.","Trichothiodystrophy Mutations in the ERCC3 gene appear to be a rare cause of trichothiodystrophy. At least one mutation in this gene can cause the photosensitive form of the condition, which is characterized by an extreme sensitivity to UV rays from sunlight.The single ERCC3 gene mutation known to cause trichothiodystrophy changes one protein building block (amino acid) in the XPB protein; specifically, it replaces the amino acid threonine with the amino acid proline at protein position 119 (written as Thr119Pro or T119P). This mutation probably makes the TFIIH complex unstable and reduces its ability to repair DNA damage caused by UV radiation. Problems with DNA repair cause people with the photosensitive form of trichothiodystrophy to be extremely sensitive to sunlight. Other features of the condition, such as slow growth, intellectual disability, and brittle hair, likely result from problems with the transcription of genes needed for normal development before and after birth.Unlike xeroderma pigmentosum (described below), trichothiodystrophy is not associated with an increased risk of skin cancer. Researchers are working to determine why some mutations in the ERCC3 gene affect a person's cancer risk and others do not. "
440,ERCC6 ,"ERCC excision repair 6, chromatin remodeling factor","The ERCC6 gene provides instructions for making a protein called Cockayne syndrome B (CSB). This protein is involved in repairing damaged DNA and appears to assist with gene transcription, which is the first step in protein production.DNA can be damaged by ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun and by toxic chemicals, radiation, and unstable molecules called free radicals. If left uncorrected, DNA damage accumulates, which causes cells to malfunction and can lead to cell death. Although DNA damage occurs frequently, cells are usually able to fix it before it can cause problems. Cells have several mechanisms to correct DNA damage; one such mechanism involves the CSB protein. This protein specializes in repairing damaged DNA within active genes (those genes undergoing gene transcription). When DNA in active genes is damaged, the enzyme that carries out gene transcription (RNA polymerase) gets stuck, and the process stalls. Researchers think that the CSB protein helps remove RNA polymerase from the damaged site, so the DNA can be repaired. The CSB protein may also assist in restarting gene transcription after the damage is corrected.","Cockayne syndrome More than 60 ERCC6 gene mutations that cause Cockayne syndrome have been identified. This rare condition includes a variety of features, including an abnormally small head size (microcephaly), very slow growth resulting in short stature, delayed development, and an increased sensitivity to sunlight (photosensitivity).Many of the ERCC6 gene mutations that cause Cockayne syndrome lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the CSB protein that cannot function properly. Other mutations change single building blocks (amino acids) in the CSB protein, which also results in a malfunctioning protein.The mechanism by which ERCC6 gene mutations lead to Cockayne syndrome is not well understood. The altered CSB protein probably hinders DNA repair and may be unable to assist with gene transcription. As a result, damaged DNA is not fixed, which disrupts gene transcription and prevents the normal production of proteins. These abnormalities impair cell function and eventually lead to the death of cells in many organs and tissues. Faulty DNA repair underlies photosensitivity in affected individuals, and researchers suspect that it also contributes to the other features of Cockayne syndrome. It is unclear how ERCC6 gene mutations cause all of the varied features of this condition. "
441,ERCC8 ,"ERCC excision repair 8, CSA ubiquitin ligase complex subunit","The ERCC8 gene provides instructions for making a protein called Cockayne syndrome A (CSA), which is involved in repairing damaged DNA. DNA can be damaged by ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun and by toxic chemicals, radiation, and unstable molecules called free radicals. The damage caused by these agents can block vital cell activities such as gene transcription, which is the first step in protein production. If left uncorrected, DNA damage accumulates, which causes cells to malfunction and can lead to cell death.Although DNA damage occurs frequently, cells are usually able to fix it before it can cause problems. Cells have several mechanisms to correct DNA damage; one such mechanism involves the CSA protein. This protein specializes in repairing damaged DNA within active genes (those genes undergoing gene transcription). However, its specific role in this process is unclear. The CSA protein interacts with other proteins, probably to identify areas of damaged DNA.","Cockayne syndrome Researchers have identified more than 30 ERCC8 gene mutations that can cause Cockayne syndrome. This rare condition includes a variety of features, including an abnormally small head size (microcephaly), very slow growth resulting in short stature, delayed development, and an increased sensitivity to sunlight (photosensitivity).Some of the ERCC8 gene mutations result in the production of an abnormally short version of the CSA protein that cannot function properly. Other mutations change one of the building blocks (amino acids) used to make the CSA protein, which also results in a malfunctioning protein.The mechanism by which ERCC8 gene mutations lead to Cockayne syndrome is not well understood. The altered CSA protein probably disrupts DNA repair. As a result, damaged DNA is not fixed, which disrupts gene transcription and prevents the normal production of proteins. These abnormalities impair cell function and eventually lead to the death of cells in many organs and tissues. Faulty DNA repair underlies photosensitivity in affected individuals, and researchers suspect that it also contributes to the other features of Cockayne syndrome. It is unclear how ERCC8 gene mutations cause all of the varied features of this condition. "
442,ESCO2 ,establishment of sister chromatid cohesion N-acetyltransferase 2,"The ESCO2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is important for proper chromosome separation during cell division. Before cells divide, they must copy all of their chromosomes. The copied DNA from each chromosome is arranged into two identical structures, called sister chromatids. The ESCO2 protein plays an important role in establishing the glue that holds the sister chromatids together until the chromosomes are ready to separate.","Roberts syndrome At least 30 ESCO2 gene mutations have been found to cause Roberts syndrome, which is characterized by limb and facial abnormalities and slow growth before and after birth. These mutations prevent the cell from producing any functional ESCO2 protein. Some mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids), while others result in an abnormally short protein. The absence of functional ESCO2 protein causes some of the glue between sister chromatids to be missing around the chromosome's constriction point (centromere). In Roberts syndrome, cells respond to abnormal sister chromatid attachment by delaying cell division. Delayed cell division can be a signal that the cell should undergo self-destruction. The signs and symptoms of Roberts syndrome may be due to the loss of cells from various tissues during early development.Researchers originally suspected that the varying severity of Roberts syndrome was caused by different types of mutations in the ESCO2 gene. They predicted that people with the mild form of the disorder would have mutations that reduced the activity of the ESCO2 protein, while those with the severe form would have mutations that completely eliminated the protein's function. However, all known mutations in the ESCO2 gene prevent the production of any functional ESCO2 protein. The underlying cause of the variation in disease severity remains unknown. Researchers suspect that other genetic and environmental factors may be involved. "
443,ETFA ,electron transfer flavoprotein subunit alpha,"The ETFA gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha subunit) of an enzyme called electron transfer flavoprotein. This enzyme is normally active in the mitochondria, the energy-producing centers in cells. Electron transfer flavoprotein is involved in the process by which fats and proteins are broken down to produce energy.","Glutaric acidemia type II Some mutations in the ETFA gene prevent the production of the electron transfer flavoprotein enzyme. Other mutations result in the production of a defective enzyme that cannot fulfill its role in the series of reactions (metabolic pathways) that break down fats and proteins. This enzyme deficiency allows these nutrients, as well as compounds created as the nutrients are partially broken down, to build up to abnormal levels, especially when the body is under stress. Toxic products of incomplete metabolism damage cells in many body systems, resulting in the signs and symptoms of glutaric acidemia type II. "
444,ETFB ,electron transfer flavoprotein subunit beta,"The ETFB gene provides instructions for making one part (the beta subunit) of an enzyme called electron transfer flavoprotein. This enzyme is normally active in the mitochondria, the energy-producing centers in cells. Electron transfer flavoprotein is involved in the process by which fats and proteins are broken down to produce energy.","Glutaric acidemia type II Some mutations in the ETFB gene prevent the production of the electron transfer flavoprotein enzyme. Other mutations result in the production of a defective enzyme that cannot fulfill its role in the series of reactions (metabolic pathways) that break down fats and proteins. This enzyme deficiency allows these nutrients, as well as compounds created as the nutrients are partially broken down, to build up to abnormal levels, especially when the body is under stress. Toxic products of incomplete metabolism damage cells in many body systems, resulting in the signs and symptoms of glutaric acidemia type II. "
445,ETFDH ,electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase,"The ETFDH gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase. This enzyme is normally active in the mitochondria, the energy-producing centers in cells. Electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase is involved in the process by which fats and proteins are broken down to produce energy.","Glutaric acidemia type II Some mutations in the ETFDH gene prevent the production of the electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase enzyme.

Toxic products of incomplete metabolism damage cells in many body systems, resulting in the signs and symptoms of glutaric acidemia type II. "
446,ETHE1 ,"ETHE1, persulfide dioxygenase","The ETHE1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is active in mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers in cells. The ETHE1 enzyme is part of a pathway that breaks down a molecule called sulfide (H2S) in mitochondria. Sulfide is produced in the body's tissues as part of normal cell processes, and it is also released by bacteria living in the gastrointestinal system (gut).At low levels, sulfide is critical for normal cell functioning. However, this molecule becomes toxic at high levels, interfering with numerous cell activities. For example, excess sulfide interferes with mitochondrial energy production by blocking (inhibiting) an enzyme complex called cytochrome C oxidase (COX). This complex normally carries out one of the final steps in the process of energy production in mitochondria.","Ethylmalonic encephalopathy More than 30 mutations in the ETHE1 gene have been identified in people with ethylmalonic encephalopathy. This rare condition affects many parts of the body, including the nervous system, blood vessels, and intestines. Signs and symptoms include delayed development, abnormal movements, rashes of tiny red spots under the skin (petechiae), blue discoloration of the hands and feet (acrocyanosis), and chronic diarrhea.Most of the mutations that cause ethylmalonic encephalopathy lead to the production of nonfunctional versions of the ETHE1 enzyme or prevent cells from making any of this enzyme. A shortage of functional enzyme prevents sulfide from being broken down normally, allowing this molecule to accumulate in cells. The buildup of sulfide inhibits the activity of COX, which disrupts mitochondrial energy production and damages tissues and organs throughout the body. Researchers believe that the effects of excess sulfide in the brain, muscles, blood vessels, and lining of the intestines underlie most of the major features of ethylmalonic encephalopathy. "
447,ETV6 ,ETS variant 6,"The ETV6 gene provides instructions for producing a protein that functions as a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and controls the activity of certain genes. The ETV6 protein is found in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it turns off (represses) gene activity. It plays a key role in development before birth and in regulating blood cell formation.","PDGFRB-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia PDGFRB-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia, a type of cancer of blood-forming cells, can be caused by a genetic rearrangement known as a translocation that brings together part of the ETV6 gene and part of another gene called PDGFRB, creating the ETV6-PDGFRB fusion gene. The translocation that leads to the ETV6-PDGFRB fusion gene is a somatic mutation, which is acquired during a person's lifetime and occurs initially in a single cell. This cell continues to grow and divide, producing a group of cells with the same mutation (a clonal population).The protein produced from the ETV6-PDGFRB fusion gene, called ETV6/PDGFRβ, functions differently than the proteins normally produced from the individual genes. Unlike the normal PDGFRβ protein, the fusion protein is always active, which means certain cell signaling pathways are constantly turned on. The fusion protein is unable to repress gene activity regulated by the normal ETV6 protein, so gene activity is increased. The overactive signaling pathways and abnormal gene activity increase the proliferation and survival of cells. When the ETV6-PDGFRB fusion gene mutation occurs in cells that develop into blood cells, the growth of white blood cells called eosinophils (and occasionally other white blood cells, such as neutrophils and mast cells) is poorly controlled, leading to PDGFRB-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia. It is unclear why eosinophils are preferentially affected by this genetic change. "
448,EVC ,EvC ciliary complex subunit 1,"The EVC gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unclear. However, it appears to be important for normal growth and development, particularly the development of bones and teeth. The EVC protein is found in primary cilia, which are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells and are involved in signaling pathways that transmit information between cells. In particular, the EVC protein is thought to help regulate a signaling pathway known as Sonic Hedgehog, which plays roles in cell growth, cell specialization, and the normal shaping (patterning) of many parts of the body.EVC and another gene, EVC2, are located very close together on chromosome 4. Researchers believe that the two genes may have related functions and that their activity may be coordinated.","Ellis-van Creveld syndrome More than 25 mutations in the EVC gene have been reported to cause Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, an inherited disorder characterized by dwarfism, abnormal nails and teeth, and heart defects. The mutations that cause this condition occur in both copies of the EVC gene in each cell. These genetic changes disrupt the normal function of the EVC protein or lead to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the protein. Although it is unclear how the loss of this protein's function underlies the signs and symptoms of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, researchers believe that it may prevent normal Sonic Hedgehog signaling in the developing embryo. Problems with this signaling pathway may ultimately lead to the abnormal bone growth and heart defects seen with this condition. "
449,EVC2 ,EvC ciliary complex subunit 2,"The EVC2 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. However, it appears to be important for normal growth and development, particularly the development of bones and teeth.

Problems with this signaling pathway may ultimately lead to the abnormal bone growth and heart defects seen with this condition. "
450,EWSR1 ,EWS RNA binding protein 1,"The EWSR1 gene provides instructions for making the EWS protein, whose function is not completely understood. The EWS protein has two regions that contribute to its function. One region, the transcriptional activation domain, allows the EWS protein to turn on (activate) the first step in the production of proteins from genes (transcription). The other region, the RNA-binding domain, allows the EWS protein to attach (bind) to the genetic blueprint for proteins called RNA. The EWS protein may be involved in piecing together this blueprint. Some studies suggest that the RNA-binding domain is able to block (inhibit) the activity of the transcriptional activation domain, and thus regulate the function of the EWS protein.","Ewing sarcoma Mutations involving the EWSR1 gene can cause a type of cancerous tumor known as Ewing sarcoma. These tumors develop in bones or soft tissues, such as nerves and cartilage. There are several types of Ewing sarcoma, including Ewing sarcoma of bone, extraosseous Ewing sarcoma, peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor, and Askin tumor. The mutations that cause these tumors are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in the tumor cells. This type of genetic change, called a somatic mutation, is not inherited. The most common mutation that causes Ewing sarcoma is a rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosome 22 and chromosome 11. This translocation, written as t(11;22), fuses part of the EWSR1 gene on chromosome 22 with part of another gene on chromosome 11 called FLI1, creating an EWSR1/FLI1 fusion gene.The protein produced from the EWSR1/FLI1 fusion gene, called EWS/FLI, has functions of the protein products of both genes. The FLI protein, produced from the FLI1 gene, attaches to DNA and regulates transcription. This protein controls the growth and development of some cell types. The EWS/FLI protein has the DNA-binding function of the FLI protein as well as the transcription regulation function of the EWS protein. It is thought that the EWS/FLI protein turns the transcription of a variety of genes on and off abnormally. This dysregulation of transcription leads to uncontrolled growth and division (proliferation) and abnormal maturation and survival of cells, causing tumor development.The EWSR1/FLI1 fusion gene occurs in approximately 85 percent of Ewing sarcomas. Translocations that fuse the EWSR1 gene with other genes that are related to the FLI1 gene can also cause these types of tumors, although these alternative translocations are relatively uncommon. The fusion proteins produced from the less common translocations have the same function as the EWS/FLI protein. "
451,EXOSC3 ,exosome component 3,"The EXOSC3 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as exosome component 3. As its name suggests, this protein forms one part (subunit) of a large, multi-protein complex known as the RNA exosome. Within cells, this complex helps to process multiple types of RNA, which are chemical cousins of DNA, by cutting (cleaving) RNA molecules in certain places. The RNA exosome also breaks down (degrades) molecules of RNA when they are no longer needed. Appropriate processing and breakdown of RNA molecules is essential for the normal functioning of all cells.Studies suggest that the activity of exosome component 3 is necessary for the normal development and growth of certain areas of the brain, particularly the cerebellum, which is the part of the brain that coordinates movement. Exosome component 3 also appears to be important for the survival of specialized nerve cells in the spinal cord called motor neurons, which play an essential role in muscle movement.","Pontocerebellar hypoplasia At least 16 mutations in the EXOSC3 gene have been identified in people with a disorder of brain development called pontocerebellar hypoplasia. The major features of this condition include delayed development overall, an unusually small head size (microcephaly), and intellectual disability. EXOSC3 gene mutations cause about half of all cases of a form of the disorder designated pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1 (PCH1). When PCH1 results from EXOSC3 gene mutations, it is sometimes categorized more specifically as PCH1B. In addition to the features listed above, PCH1B causes problems with muscle movement resulting from a loss of specialized nerve cells called motor neurons in the spinal cord.The EXOSC3 gene mutations that cause PCH1B result in an exosome component 3 protein with reduced or no function. The most common mutation alters a single protein building block (amino acid) in exosome component 3; it replaces the amino acid aspartic acid with the amino acid alanine at protein position 132 (written as Asp132Ala or D132A). People with this mutation tend to have somewhat less severe brain abnormalities than people with other EXOSC3 gene mutations. Changes in this gene likely impair the activity of the RNA exosome, but it is unclear how these alterations lead to the problems with brain development and loss of motor neurons characteristic of PCH1B. "
452,EXT1 ,exostosin glycosyltransferase 1,"The EXT1 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called exostosin-1. This protein is found in a cell structure called the Golgi apparatus, which modifies newly produced enzymes and other proteins. In the Golgi apparatus, exostosin-1 attaches (binds) to another protein, exostosin-2, to form a complex that modifies heparan sulfate. Heparan sulfate is a complex of sugar molecules (a polysaccharide) that is added to proteins to form proteoglycans, which are proteins attached to several sugars. Heparan sulfate is involved in regulating a variety of body processes including blood clotting and the formation of blood vessels (angiogenesis). It also has a role in the spreading (metastasis) of cancer cells.","Hereditary multiple osteochondromas About 480 mutations in the EXT1 gene have been identified in people with hereditary multiple osteochondromas type 1, a condition in which people develop multiple benign (noncancerous) bone tumors called osteochondromas. Most of these mutations are known as ""loss-of-function"" mutations because they prevent any functional exostosin-1 protein from being made. The loss of functional exostosin-1 protein prevents it from forming a complex with the exostosin-2 protein and adding heparan sulfate to proteins. It is unclear how this impairment leads to the signs and symptoms of hereditary multiple osteochondromas. "
453,EXT2 ,exostosin glycosyltransferase 2,"The EXT2 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called exostosin-2. This protein is found in a cell structure called the Golgi apparatus, which modifies newly produced enzymes and other proteins. In the Golgi apparatus, exostosin-2 attaches (binds) to another protein, exostosin-1, to form a complex that modifies a protein called heparan sulfate so it can be used in the body. Heparan sulfate is involved in regulating a variety of body processes including the formation of blood vessels (angiogenesis) and blood clotting. It also has a role in the spread (metastasis) of cancer cells.","Hereditary multiple osteochondromas About 220 mutations in the EXT2 gene have been identified in people with hereditary multiple osteochondromas type 2, a condition in which people develop multiple benign (noncancerous) bone tumors called osteochondromas. Most of these mutations prevent any functional exostosin-2 protein from being made, and are called ""loss-of-function"" mutations. The loss of exostosin-2 protein function prevents it from forming a complex with the exostosin-1 protein and modifying heparan sulfate. It is unclear how this impairment leads to the development of multiple osteochondromas. "
454,EYA1 ,EYA transcriptional coactivator and phosphatase 1,"The EYA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a role in regulating the activity of other genes. Based on this role, the EYA1 protein is called a transcription factor or transcription coactivator.The EYA1 protein interacts with several other proteins, including a group known as SIX proteins, to turn on (activate) and turn off (inactivate) genes that are important for normal development. Before birth, these protein interactions appear to be essential for the normal formation of many tissues. These include the second branchial arch, which gives rise to tissues in the front and side of the neck, and the eyes, ears, and kidneys. After birth, these interactions are important for normal organ function.","Branchiootorenal/branchiootic syndrome At least 160 mutations in the EYA1 gene have been identified in people with branchiootorenal (BOR) syndrome, a condition that disrupts the development of tissues in the neck and causes malformations of the ears and kidneys. EYA1 gene mutations have also been found to cause branchiootic (BO) syndrome, which includes many of the same features as BOR syndrome except for kidney (renal) malformations. The two conditions are otherwise so similar that researchers often consider them together (BOR/BO syndrome or branchiootorenal spectrum disorders).Many of the mutations that cause BOR/BO syndrome change the 3-dimensional structure of the EYA1 protein, which prevents it from interacting effectively with other proteins. Because these protein interactions are necessary for the activation of certain genes during embryonic development, the altered EYA1 protein impairs the normal development of many tissues before birth. The major signs and symptoms of BOR/BO syndrome result from abnormal development of the second branchial arch, the ears, and (in BOR syndrome) the kidneys.In some cases, the same EYA1 gene mutation causes BOR syndrome in some members of a family and BO syndrome in others. This variability might result from changes in other, unidentified genes that affect how the EYA1 protein functions in the kidneys. "
455,EZH2 ,enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit,"The EZH2 gene provides instructions for making a type of enzyme called a histone methyltransferase. Histone methyltransferases modify proteins called histones, which are structural proteins that attach (bind) to DNA and give chromosomes their shape. By adding a molecule called a methyl group to histones (methylation), histone methyltransferases can turn off (suppress) the activity of certain genes, an essential process in normal development. Specifically, the EZH2 enzyme forms part of a protein group called the polycomb repressive complex-2. By turning off particular genes, this complex is involved in the process that determines the type of cell an immature cell will ultimately become (cell fate determination).","Weaver syndrome More than 30 EZH2 gene mutations have been identified in people with Weaver syndrome, which involves tall stature, a variable degree of intellectual disability (usually mild), and characteristic facial features. These features can include a broad forehead; widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism); large, low-set ears; a dimpled chin; and a small lower jaw (micrognathia). Some affected individuals have a large head size (macrocephaly). Most of the EZH2 gene mutations associated with Weaver syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the EZH2 enzyme; others insert or delete small amounts of genetic material from the EZH2 gene, leading to production of an altered EZH2 enzyme. It is unclear how these EZH2 gene mutations result in the abnormalities characteristic of Weaver syndrome. "
456,F2 ,"coagulation factor II, thrombin","The F2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called prothrombin (also called coagulation factor II). Coagulation factors are a group of related proteins that are essential for normal blood clotting (hemostasis). After an injury, clots protect the body by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss.Prothrombin is made chiefly by cells in the liver. The protein circulates in the bloodstream in an inactive form until an injury occurs that damages blood vessels. In response to injury, prothrombin is converted to its active form, thrombin. Thrombin then converts a protein called fibrinogen into fibrin, the primary protein that makes up blood clots.Thrombin is also thought to be involved in cell growth and division (proliferation), tissue repair, and the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis).","Prothrombin deficiency More than 50 mutations in the F2 gene have been found to cause prothrombin deficiency. Most of these mutations change one protein building block (amino acid) in prothrombin. Some mutations drastically reduce the activity of prothrombin and can lead to severe bleeding episodes. Other mutations allow for a moderate amount of activity of prothrombin, typically causing mild bleeding episodes. None of the mutations identified eliminate prothrombin function. Researchers believe that people cannot live with a complete absence of prothrombin. "
457,F5 ,coagulation factor V,"The F5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called coagulation factor V. Coagulation factors are a group of related proteins that make up the coagulation system, a series of chemical reactions that form blood clots. After an injury, clots seal off blood vessels to stop bleeding and trigger blood vessel repair.The factor V protein is made primarily by cells in the liver. The protein circulates in the bloodstream in an inactive form until the coagulation system is activated by an injury that damages blood vessels. When coagulation factor V is activated, it interacts with coagulation factor X. The active forms of these two coagulation factors (written as factor Va and factor Xa, respectively) form a complex that converts an important coagulation protein called prothrombin to its active form, thrombin. Thrombin then converts a protein called fibrinogen into fibrin, which is the material that forms the clot.Coagulation factor V has another role in regulating the coagulation system through its interaction with activated protein C (APC). APC normally inactivates coagulation factor V by cutting (cleaving) it at specific sites. This inactivation slows down the clotting process and prevents clots from growing too large. When coagulation factor V is cleaved at a particular site (protein position 506), it can work with APC to inactivate factor VIIIa, which is another protein that is essential for normal blood clotting.","Factor V deficiency At least 100 mutations in the F5 gene have been found to cause a rare bleeding disorder called factor V deficiency. These mutations prevent the production of functional coagulation factor V or significantly reduce the amount of the protein in the bloodstream. People with this condition typically have less than 10 percent of normal levels of coagulation factor V in their blood; the most severely affected individuals have less than 1 percent. A reduced amount of functional factor V prevents blood from clotting normally, causing episodes of abnormal bleeding that can be severe. Factor V deficiency results from mutations in both copies of the F5 gene, although some people with a mutation in a single copy of the gene have mild bleeding problems. "
458,F7 ,coagulation factor VII,"The F7 gene provides instructions for making a protein called coagulation factor VII. Coagulation factors are a group of related proteins that are involved in the coagulation system, which is a series of chemical reactions that form blood clots. After an injury, clots seal off blood vessels to stop bleeding and trigger blood vessel repair.Coagulation factor VII is made primarily by cells in the liver. The protein circulates in the bloodstream in an inactive form until the coagulation system is turned on (activated) by an injury that damages blood vessels. Activated coagulation factor VII helps turn on other coagulation factors in turn. This step-wise process ultimately promotes the conversion of an important coagulation protein called fibrinogen into fibrin, which is the material that forms blood clots.","Factor VII deficiency Almost 300 mutations in the F7 gene have been found to cause a rare bleeding disorder called factor VII deficiency. This disorder commonly causes nosebleeds, easy bruising, bleeding of the gums, and prolonged or excessive bleeding following surgery or physical injury. In severe cases, life-threatening episodes of bleeding inside the skull or gastrointestinal tract can occur. Some affected individuals have no bleeding problems. The F7 gene mutations involved in this condition reduce the amount of coagulation factor VII in the bloodstream. A shortage of coagulation factor VII prevents blood from clotting normally, causing episodes of abnormal bleeding that can be severe. What determines the severity of the condition is unclear; it does not appear to be related to the amount of coagulation factor VII in the blood. "
459,F8 ,coagulation factor VIII,"The F8 gene provides instructions for making a protein called coagulation factor VIII. Coagulation factors are a group of related proteins that are essential for the formation of blood clots. After an injury, clots protect the body by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss.Coagulation factor VIII is made chiefly by cells in the liver. This protein circulates in the bloodstream in an inactive form, bound to another molecule called von Willebrand factor, until an injury that damages blood vessels occurs. In response to injury, coagulation factor VIII is activated and separates from von Willebrand factor. The active protein (sometimes written as coagulation factor VIIIa) interacts with another coagulation factor called factor IX. This interaction sets off a chain of additional chemical reactions that form a blood clot.","Hemophilia Mutations in the F8 gene cause hemophilia A, the most common form of this bleeding disorder. More than 1,300 alterations in this gene have been identified. Some of these mutations change single DNA building blocks (base pairs) in the gene, while others delete or insert multiple base pairs. The most common mutation in people with severe hemophilia A is a rearrangement of genetic material called an inversion. This inversion involves a large segment of the F8 gene.Mutations in the F8 gene lead to the production of an abnormal version of coagulation factor VIII or reduce the amount of this protein. The altered or missing protein cannot participate effectively in the blood clotting process. As a result, blood clots cannot form properly in response to injury. These problems with blood clotting lead to excessive bleeding that can be difficult to control. Some mutations, such as the large inversion described above, almost completely eliminate the activity of coagulation factor VIII and result in severe hemophilia. Other mutations reduce but do not eliminate the protein's activity, resulting in mild or moderate hemophilia. "
460,F9 ,coagulation factor IX,"The F9 gene provides instructions for making a protein called coagulation factor IX. Coagulation factors are a group of related proteins that are essential for the formation of blood clots. After an injury, clots protect the body by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss.Coagulation factor IX is made in the liver. This protein circulates in the bloodstream in an inactive form until an injury that damages blood vessels occurs. In response to injury, coagulation factor IX is activated by another coagulation factor called factor XIa. The active protein (sometimes written as coagulation factor IXa) interacts with coagulation factor VIII and other molecules. These interactions set off a chain of additional chemical reactions that form a blood clot.","Hemophilia Mutations in the F9 gene cause a type of hemophilia called hemophilia B. More than 900 alterations in this gene have been identified. The most common mutations change single DNA building blocks (base pairs) in the gene. A small percentage of mutations delete or insert multiple base pairs or rearrange segments of DNA within the gene.Mutations in the F9 gene lead to the production of an abnormal version of coagulation factor IX or reduce the amount of this protein. The altered or missing protein cannot participate effectively in the blood clotting process. As a result, blood clots cannot form properly in response to injury. These problems with blood clotting lead to excessive bleeding that can be difficult to control. Mutations that completely eliminate the activity of coagulation factor IX result in severe hemophilia. Mutations that reduce but do not eliminate the protein's activity usually cause mild or moderate hemophilia.Several mutations near the beginning of the F9 gene sequence cause an unusual form of hemophilia known as hemophilia B Leyden. People with these mutations are born with very low levels of functional coagulation factor IX, but hormonal changes cause the levels of this protein to increase gradually during puberty. As a result, adults with hemophilia B Leyden rarely experience episodes of abnormal bleeding. "
461,F10 ,coagulation factor X,"The F10 gene provides instructions for making a protein called coagulation factor X. Coagulation factors are a group of related proteins that are involved in the coagulation system, which is a series of chemical reactions that form blood clots. After an injury, clots seal off blood vessels to stop bleeding and trigger blood vessel repair.Coagulation factor X is made primarily by cells in the liver. The protein circulates in the bloodstream in an inactive form until the coagulation system is turned on (activated) by an injury that damages blood vessels. When coagulation factor X is activated, it interacts with other coagulation factors to convert an important coagulation protein called prothrombin to its active form, thrombin. Thrombin then converts a protein called fibrinogen into fibrin, which is the material that forms blood clots.","Factor X deficiency At least 130 mutations in the F10 gene have been found to cause a rare bleeding disorder called factor X deficiency. This disorder commonly causes nosebleeds, easy bruising, bleeding under the skin, bleeding of the gums, blood in the urine (hematuria), and prolonged or excessive bleeding following surgery or trauma. Some F10 gene mutations that cause factor X deficiency reduce the amount of coagulation factor X in the bloodstream, resulting in a form of the disorder called type I. Other F10 gene mutations result in the production of a coagulation factor X protein with impaired function, leading to type II factor X deficiency. Reduced quantity or function of coagulation factor X prevents blood from clotting normally, causing episodes of abnormal bleeding that can be severe. "
462,F11 ,coagulation factor XI,"The F11 gene provides instructions for making a protein called factor XI. This protein plays a role in the coagulation cascade, which is a series of chemical reactions that forms blood clots in response to injury. After an injury, clots seal off blood vessels to stop bleeding and trigger blood vessel repair.Factor XI is made primarily by cells in the liver. The protein circulates in the bloodstream and is normally turned off (inactive) until the coagulation cascade is turned on (activated) by an injury that damages blood vessels. When factor XI is activated, it interacts with other coagulation factors, resulting in conversion of an important coagulation protein called prothrombin to its active form, thrombin. Thrombin then converts a protein called fibrinogen into fibrin, which is the material that forms blood clots.","Factor XI deficiency About 250 mutations in the F11 gene have been found to cause a rare bleeding disorder called factor XI deficiency. This disorder, while usually mild, can cause nosebleeds, easy bruising, bleeding under the skin, bleeding of the gums, and prolonged or excessive bleeding following surgery, dental procedures, or trauma. The F11 gene mutations that cause factor XI deficiency reduce the amount of factor XI in the bloodstream or result in the production of a factor XI protein with impaired function. A deficiency of functional factor XI slows blood clotting, causing episodes of abnormal bleeding.The amount of functional factor XI remaining varies depending on the particular mutation and whether one or both copies of the F11 gene in each cell have mutations. However, the severity of the bleeding problems in affected individuals does not necessarily correspond to the amount of factor XI in the bloodstream, and can vary even within the same family. Other genetic and environmental factors likely play a role in determining the severity of this condition. "
463,F12 ,coagulation factor XII,"The F12 gene provides instructions for making a protein called coagulation factor XII. Coagulation factors are a group of related proteins that are essential for normal blood clotting (coagulation). After an injury, clots protect the body by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss. Factor XII circulates in the bloodstream in an inactive form until it is activated, usually by coming in contact with damaged blood vessel walls. Upon activation, factor XII interacts with coagulation factor XI. This interaction sets off a chain of additional chemical reactions that form a blood clot.Factor XII also plays a role in stimulating inflammation, a normal body response to infection, irritation, or other injury. When factor XII is activated, it also interacts with a protein called plasma prekallikrein. This interaction initiates a series of chemical reactions that lead to the release of a protein called bradykinin. Bradykinin promotes inflammation by increasing the permeability of blood vessel walls, allowing more fluids to leak into body tissues. This leakage causes the swelling that accompanies inflammation.","Hereditary angioedema At least two mutations in the F12 gene are associated with hereditary angioedema type III. These mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in factor XII, which increases the activity of the protein. As a result, more bradykinin is produced, which allows additional fluids to leak through blood vessel walls. The accumulation of fluids in body tissues leads to the episodes of swelling in people with hereditary angioedema type III. "
464,F13A1 ,coagulation factor XIII A chain,"The F13A1 gene provides instructions for making one part, the A subunit, of a protein called factor XIII. This protein is part of a group of related proteins called coagulation factors that are essential for normal blood clotting. They work together as part of the coagulation cascade, which is a series of chemical reactions that forms blood clots in response to injury. After an injury, clots seal off blood vessels to stop bleeding and trigger blood vessel repair. Factor XIII acts at the end of the cascade to strengthen and stabilize newly formed clots, preventing further blood loss.Factor XIII in the bloodstream is made of two A subunits (produced from the F13A1 gene) and two B subunits (produced from the F13B gene). When a new blood clot forms, the A and B subunits separate from one another, and the A subunit is cut (cleaved) to produce the active form of factor XIII (factor XIIIa). The active protein links together molecules of fibrin, the material that forms the clot, which strengthens the clot and keeps other molecules from breaking it down.Studies suggest that factor XIII has additional functions, although these are less well understood than its role in blood clotting. Specifically, factor XIII is likely involved in other aspects of wound healing, immune system function, maintaining pregnancy, bone formation, and the growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis).","Factor XIII deficiency At least 140 mutations in the F13A1 gene have been found to cause inherited factor XIII deficiency, a rare bleeding disorder. Without treatment, affected individuals have a greatly increased risk of abnormal bleeding episodes, including life-threatening bleeding inside the skull (intracranial hemorrhage). F13A1 gene mutations severely reduce the amount or activity of the A subunit of factor XIII. In most people with these mutations, the level of functional factor XIII in the bloodstream is less than 5 percent of normal. This loss of factor XIII activity weakens new blood clots and prevents them from stopping blood loss effectively. "
465,F13B ,coagulation factor XIII B chain,"The F13B gene provides instructions for making one part, the B subunit, of a protein called factor XIII. This protein is part of a group of related proteins called coagulation factors that are essential for normal blood clotting. They work together as part of the coagulation cascade, which is a series of chemical reactions that forms blood clots in response to injury. After an injury, clots seal off blood vessels to stop bleeding and trigger blood vessel repair. Factor XIII acts at the end of the cascade to strengthen and stabilize newly formed clots, preventing further blood loss.Factor XIII in the bloodstream is made of two A subunits (produced from the F13A1 gene) and two B subunits (produced from the F13B gene). The role of the B subunits is to carry and stabilize the A subunits, protecting them from being broken down. When a new blood clot forms, the A and B subunits separate from one another, and the A subunits are cut (cleaved) to produce the active form of factor XIII (factor XIIIa). The active protein links together molecules of fibrin, the material that forms the clot, which strengthens the clot and keeps other molecules from breaking it down.Studies suggest that factor XIII has additional functions, although these are less well understood than its role in blood clotting. Specifically, factor XIII is likely involved in other aspects of wound healing, immune system function, maintaining pregnancy, bone formation, and the growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis).","Factor XIII deficiency At least 17 mutations in the F13B gene have been found to cause inherited factor XIII deficiency, a rare bleeding disorder. Without treatment, affected individuals have a greatly increased risk of abnormal bleeding episodes, including life-threatening bleeding inside the skull (intracranial hemorrhage). F13B gene mutations severely reduce the amount or disrupt the function of the B subunit of factor XIII, preventing it from stabilizing and protecting the A subunit. The resulting loss of factor XIII activity weakens new blood clots and prevents them from stopping blood loss effectively. "
466,FA2H ,fatty acid 2-hydroxylase,"The FA2H gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called fatty acid 2-hydroxylase. This enzyme modifies fatty acids, which are building blocks used to make fats (lipids). Specifically, fatty acid 2-hydroxylase adds a single oxygen atom to a hydrogen atom at a particular point on a fatty acid to create a 2-hydroxylated fatty acid. Certain 2-hydroxylated fatty acids are important in forming normal myelin; myelin is the protective covering that insulates nerves and ensures the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. The part of the brain and spinal cord that contains myelin is called white matter.","Fatty acid hydroxylase-associated neurodegeneration At least nine mutations in the FA2H gene have been identified in people with fatty acid hydroxylase-associated neurodegeneration (FAHN). FAHN is a progressive disorder of the nervous system characterized by problems with movement and vision that begin during childhood or adolescence and worsen with age. Brain scans of affected individuals show abnormal accumulation of iron in the brain, especially in a region that is involved in movement.The FA2H gene mutations that cause FAHN reduce or eliminate the function of the fatty acid 2-hydroxylase enzyme. Reduction of this enzyme's function may result in abnormal myelin that is prone to deterioration (demyelination), leading to a loss of white matter (leukodystrophy). Leukodystrophy is likely involved in the development of the movement problems and other neurological abnormalities that occur in FAHN. Iron accumulation in the brain is probably also involved, although it is unclear how FA2H gene mutations lead to the buildup of iron.People with FA2H gene mutations and some of the movement problems seen in FAHN were once classified as having a separate disorder called spastic paraplegia 35. People with mutations in this gene resulting in intellectual decline and optic nerve atrophy were said to have a disorder called FA2H-related leukodystrophy. However, these conditions are now generally considered to be forms of FAHN. "
467,FAH ,fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase,"The FAH gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase. This enzyme is abundant in the liver and kidneys, and smaller amounts are found in many tissues throughout the body. Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase is the last in a series of five enzymes that work to break down the amino acid tyrosine, a protein building block found in many foods. Specifically, fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase converts a tyrosine byproduct called fumarylacetoacetate into smaller molecules that are either excreted by the kidneys or used to produce energy or make other substances in the body.","Tyrosinemia At least 86 FAH mutations have been found that cause tyrosinemia type I. This condition is characterized by severe liver and kidney disease, neurological problems, and other signs and symptoms that begin in infancy. The altered FAH gene that causes this condition produces an unstable or inactive enzyme, which results in reduced or absent fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase activity. The most common FAH mutation disrupts the way the gene's instructions are used to make the enzyme. This mutation (written IVS12 + 5G>A) is called a splice-site mutation and results in an abnormally short enzyme. Without sufficient fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase activity, tyrosine and its byproducts are not properly broken down. As a result, fumarylacetoacetate accumulates in the liver and kidneys. Elevated levels of fumarylacetoacetate are thought to be toxic to cells and accumulation of this substance likely causes the liver and kidney problems and other features that are characteristic of tyrosinemia type I.In several cases of tyrosinemia type I, the FAH gene mutation has been observed to revert to the normal state in some liver cells. If enough cells have the reverted gene, which produces normal fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase, some level of enzyme activity is achieved. Researchers have found a correlation between the severity of symptoms and the extent of reversion in liver cells. People with severe symptoms of tyrosinemia type I have few reverted cells, while those with milder symptoms have many cells with the reverted FAH gene. "
468,FAM83H ,family with sequence similarity 83 member H,"The FAM83H gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not well understood. The protein is found in several types of cells, including specialized cells called ameloblasts. Ameloblasts produce tooth enamel, which is the hard, calcium-rich material that forms the protective outer layer of each tooth. The FAM83H protein is thought to be involved in the formation of enamel, although its role in this process is unknown.","Amelogenesis imperfecta At least 20 mutations in the FAM83H gene have been found in an autosomal dominant form of a disorder of tooth development called amelogenesis imperfecta. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of the FAM83H gene in each cell is altered. All of the known FAM83H gene mutations lead to production of an abnormally short protein. While the normal protein is found in the fluid-filled space inside the cell (the cytoplasm), the altered protein is found in the cell's nucleus. Researchers speculate that the altered protein produced from the mutated copy of the gene interferes with the function of the normal protein produced from the non-mutated copy of the gene (such mutations are described as ""dominant-negative""). However, researchers do not know how the altered protein leads to teeth with unusually thin, rough, yellowish-brown enamel. "
469,FAM111B ,family with sequence similarity 111 member B,"The FAM111B gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not well understood. The FAM111B protein, which is found in many parts of the body, contains a functional region called a peptidase domain. Similar proteins containing such a domain are able to break down other proteins. However, the types of proteins the FAM111B protein interacts with and the roles it plays in the body are unknown.","Hereditary fibrosing poikiloderma with tendon contractures, myopathy, and pulmonary fibrosis At least six mutations in the FAM111B gene have been identified in people with hereditary fibrosing poikiloderma with tendon contractures, myopathy, and pulmonary fibrosis (POIKTMP). This disorder affects many parts of the body, particularly the skin, muscles, lungs, and pancreas.The FAM111B gene mutations that cause POIKTMP result in production of an abnormal FAM111B protein from one copy of the gene in each cell. Because most of the FAM111B mutations identified in people with POIKTMP change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the peptidase domain, researchers think that the mutations alter the protein's function, and that these changes in FAM111B function underlie the varied signs and symptoms of POIKTMP. "
470,FAM126A ,family with sequence similarity 126 member A,"The FAM126A gene provides instructions for making a protein called hyccin, which is active (expressed) throughout the nervous system. Researchers believe that hyccin is involved in the formation of myelin, which is the covering that protects nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. Hyccin is also active in the lens of the eye, the heart, and the kidneys; however, the protein's function in these tissues is unclear.","Hypomyelination and congenital cataract At least four mutations in the FAM126A gene have been found to cause hypomyelination and congenital cataract. Most mutations delete a large portion of the gene or create a premature stop signal in the instructions for making hyccin. These mutations prevent the production of any functional protein. One FAM126A gene mutation allows some protein to be produced. This mutation replaces the protein building block (amino acid) leucine with the amino acid proline at position 53 in the hyccin protein (written as Leu53Pro or L53P). People with the Leu53Pro mutation tend to have milder symptoms than those with mutations that prevent the production of any protein.Any disruption in the production of hyccin impairs its role in the formation of myelin, leading to neurological problems such as intellectual disability and walking difficulties. It is unclear how a lack of hyccin causes a clouding of the lens (cataract) in both eyes that is typically present from birth in affected individuals. The neurological problems and cataracts are the characteristic features seen in people with hypomyelination and congenital cataract. "
471,FANCA ,FA complementation group A,"The FANCA gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in a cell process known as the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway. The FA pathway is turned on (activated) when the process of making new copies of DNA, called DNA replication, is blocked due to DNA damage. The FA pathway is particularly responsive to a certain type of DNA damage known as interstrand cross-links (ICLs). ICLs occur when two DNA building blocks (nucleotides) on opposite strands of DNA are abnormally attached or linked together, which stops the process of DNA replication. ICLs can be caused by a buildup of toxic substances produced in the body or by treatment with certain cancer therapy drugs.The FANCA protein is one of a group of proteins known as the FA core complex. The FA core complex is composed of eight FA proteins (including FANCA) and two proteins called Fanconi anemia-associated proteins (FAAPs). This complex activates two proteins, called FANCD2 and FANCI, by attaching a single molecule called ubiquitin to each of them (a process called monoubiquitination). The activation of these two proteins, which attach (bind) together to form the ID protein complex, attract DNA repair proteins to the area of DNA damage so the error can be corrected and DNA replication can continue.","Fanconi anemia More than 450 mutations in the FANCA gene have been found to cause Fanconi anemia, a disorder characterized by a decrease in bone marrow function, an increased cancer risk, and physical abnormalities. Mutations in the FANCA gene are responsible for 60 to 70 percent of all cases of Fanconi anemia. These mutations change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) or insert or delete pieces of DNA in the FANCA gene. Some mutations allow production of a FANCA protein that has some residual function; other mutations prevent the production of any FANCA protein. Mutations that prevent all protein production usually lead to a shortage of blood cells at an earlier age and increase the risk of developing cancer of the blood-forming cells (leukemia) as compared to mutations that allow for some FANCA protein production.Mutations in the FANCA gene lead to a nonfunctional FA core complex, which disrupts the entire FA pathway. As a result, DNA damage is not repaired efficiently and ICLs build up over time. The ICLs stall DNA replication, ultimately resulting in either abnormal cell death due to an inability make new DNA molecules or uncontrolled cell growth due to a lack of DNA repair processes. Cells that divide quickly, such as bone marrow cells and cells of the developing fetus, are particularly affected. The death of these cells results in the decrease in blood cells and the physical abnormalities characteristic of Fanconi anemia. When the buildup of errors in DNA leads to uncontrolled cell growth, affected individuals can develop leukemia or other cancers. "
472,FANCC ,FA complementation group C,"The FANCC gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in a cell process known as the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway. The FA pathway is turned on (activated) when the process of making new copies of DNA, called DNA replication, is blocked due to DNA damage.

The activation of these two proteins, which attach (bind) together to form the ID protein complex, attract DNA repair proteins to the area of DNA damage so the error can be corrected and DNA replication can continue.","Fanconi anemia At least 50 mutations in the FANCC gene have been found to cause Fanconi anemia, a disorder characterized by a decrease in bone marrow function, an increased cancer risk, and physical abnormalities. Mutations in the FANCC gene are responsible for about 15 percent of all cases of Fanconi anemia. A particular mutation in the FANCC gene has been found in people with Central and Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish background. This mutation (written as 456+4A>T) disrupts the way the gene's instructions are used to make the protein. Individuals with this mutation tend to have more severe signs and symptoms than people who have some of the other mutations in the FANCC gene.Most mutations in the FANCC gene that cause Fanconi anemia lead to absent or reduced protein function. As a result, the FA core complex cannot function and the entire FA pathway is disrupted. Due to the disrupted pathway, DNA damage is not repaired efficiently and ICLs build up over time. The ICLs stall DNA replication, ultimately resulting in either abnormal cell death due to an inability make new DNA molecules or uncontrolled cell growth due to a lack of DNA repair processes. Cells that divide quickly, such as bone marrow cells and cells of the developing fetus, are particularly affected. The death of these cells results in the decrease in blood cells and the physical abnormalities characteristic of Fanconi anemia. When the buildup of errors in DNA leads to uncontrolled cell growth, affected individuals can develop leukemia or other cancers. "
473,FANCG ,FA complementation group G,"The FANCG gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in a cell process known as the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway. The FA pathway is turned on (activated) when the process of making new copies of DNA, called DNA replication, is blocked due to DNA damage. The FA pathway is particularly responsive to a certain type of DNA damage known as interstrand cross-links (ICLs).

About 10 percent of all cases of Fanconi anemia are caused by mutations in the FANCG gene. When Fanconi anemia results from mutations in this gene, it is often associated with a more severe shortage of blood cells than when the condition is caused by mutations in other genes.Most mutations in the FANCG gene that cause Fanconi anemia lead to absent or reduced protein function. Individuals who have mutations that lead to no protein production typically have more severe signs or symptoms than people who have mutations that allow for some FANCG protein production. Due to a decrease in FANCG protein function, the FA core complex cannot function and the entire FA pathway is disrupted. As a result, DNA damage is not repaired efficiently and ICLs build up over time. The ICLs stall DNA replication, ultimately resulting in either abnormal cell death due to an inability make new DNA molecules or uncontrolled cell growth due to a lack of DNA repair processes.

The death of these cells results in the decrease in blood cells and the physical abnormalities characteristic of Fanconi anemia. When the buildup of errors in DNA leads to uncontrolled cell growth, affected individuals can develop leukemia or other cancers. "
474,FAS ,Fas cell surface death receptor,"The FAS gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in cell signaling. Three FAS proteins group together to form a structure called a trimer, which then interacts with other molecules to perform its signaling function. This signaling initiates a process called a caspase cascade. The caspase cascade is a series of steps that results in the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis) when they are not needed.","Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome At least 115 mutations in the FAS gene have been identified in people with a disorder of the immune system called autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS). ALPS is characterized by the production of an abnormally large number of immune system cells (lymphocytes), resulting in enlargement of the lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), the liver (hepatomegaly), and the spleen (splenomegaly). Autoimmune disorders, in which the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs, are also common in ALPS. People with ALPS have an increased risk of developing cancer of the immune system cells (lymphoma).When the immune system is activated to fight an infection, large numbers of lymphocytes are produced. Normally, these lymphocytes undergo apoptosis when they are no longer required. FAS gene mutations lead to an abnormal trimer that interferes with the initiation of apoptosis. As a result, excess lymphocytes accumulate in the body's tissues and organs and often begin attacking them, leading to autoimmune disorders. Interference with apoptosis allows cells to multiply without control, leading to the lymphomas that occur in people with this disorder. "
475,FAT4 ,FAT atypical cadherin 4,"The FAT4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in most tissues. The protein spans the membrane surrounding cells so that part of the protein is outside the cell and part of the protein is inside the cell. The precise function of the FAT4 protein is largely unknown; however, research shows that the FAT4 protein is likely involved in determining the position of various components within cells (cell polarity). The FAT4 protein is also thought to function as a tumor suppressor, which means that it keeps cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.","Hennekam syndrome At least seven mutations in the FAT4 gene have been found to cause Hennekam syndrome, an inherited disorder resulting from malformation of the lymphatic system, which consists of a network of vessels that transport lymph fluid and immune cells throughout the body. The FAT4 gene mutations that cause Hennekam syndrome reduce the activity of the FAT4 protein, which seems to impair normal development of the lymphatic system. However, the mechanism is unknown. A poorly formed lymphatic system leads to lymphatic vessels that are abnormally expanded (lymphangiectasia) and are prone to break open (rupture), puffiness or swelling caused by a buildup of fluid (lymphedema), and other features of Hennekam syndrome. FAT4 gene mutations account for about 25 percent of all cases of Hennekam syndrome. "
476,FBLN5 ,fibulin 5,"The FBLN5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called fibulin-5. This protein is part of a group of proteins called fibulins. Fibulins have a variety of functions in the extracellular matrix, which is the intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells.In the extracellular matrix, fibulin-5 appears to play a critical role in the assembly of elastic fibers. These slender bundles of proteins provide strength and flexibility to connective tissue (tissue that supports the body's joints and organs). Fibulin-5 is found in tissues and organs that are rich in elastic fibers, including developing arteries and the heart valves, lungs, and skin.","Cutis laxa At least four mutations in the FBLN5 gene have been identified in people with cutis laxa. Mutations in this gene can cause two different types of cutis laxa: an autosomal dominant form and an autosomal recessive form. In autosomal dominant cutis laxa, one copy of the altered FBLN5 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the characteristic features of the disorder. In autosomal recessive cutis laxa, both copies of the gene in each cell must be altered to result in the disease.The FBLN5 mutation known to cause autosomal dominant cutis laxa leads to the production of an abnormally long, nonfunctional version of fibulin-5. This abnormal protein interferes with the normal fibulin-5 produced from the other, unaltered copy of the FBLN5 gene. As a result, the amount of functional fibulin-5 in the extracellular matrix is severely reduced. A shortage of this protein prevents the assembly of elastic fibers, which weakens connective tissue in the skin, arteries, lungs, and other organs. These defects in connective tissue underlie the major features of cutis laxa.Autosomal recessive cutis laxa results from FBLN5 mutations that change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in fibulin-5. These mutations alter the structure of the protein, trapping it within the cell. Because the defective fibulin-5 never makes it to the extracellular matrix, it is not available for the assembly of elastic fibers. A shortage of normal elastic fibers weakens connective tissue throughout the body, leading to the signs and symptoms of cutis laxa. "
477,FBN1 ,fibrillin 1,"The FBN1 gene provides instructions for making a large protein called fibrillin-1. This protein is transported out of cells into the extracellular matrix, which is an intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. In this matrix, molecules of fibrillin-1 attach (bind) to each other and to other proteins to form threadlike filaments called microfibrils. Microfibrils form elastic fibers, which enable the skin, ligaments, and blood vessels to stretch. Microfibrils also provide support to more rigid tissues such as bones and the tissues that support the nerves, muscles, and lenses of the eyes.Microfibrils store a protein called transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), a critical growth factor. TGF-β affects development by helping to control the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (motility), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). Microfibrils help regulate the availability of TGF-β, which is turned off (inactivated) when stored in microfibrils and turned on (activated) when released.","Acromicric dysplasia At least nine FBN1 gene mutations have been identified in people with acromicric dysplasia. This condition is characterized by severely short stature, short limbs, stiff joints, and distinctive facial features.FBN1 gene mutations that cause acromicric dysplasia are located in an area of the gene called exons 41 and 42, and change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in a region of the fibrillin-1 protein called TGF-β binding-protein-like domain 5. The mutations result in a reduction and disorganization of the microfibrils. Without enough normal microfibrils to store TGF-β, the growth factor is abnormally active. These effects likely contribute to the physical abnormalities that occur in acromicric dysplasia, but the mechanisms are unclear.It is unknown why the FBN1 gene mutations that cause acromicric dysplasia lead to short stature, while certain other FBN1 gene mutations that also increase TGF-β activity cause a disorder called Marfan syndrome (see below), which is characterized by tall stature. "
478,FBN2 ,fibrillin 2,"The FBN2 gene provides instructions for making a large protein called fibrillin-2. This protein is transported out of cells into the extracellular matrix, which is an intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. In this matrix, fibrillin-2 binds to other proteins to form threadlike filaments called microfibrils. Microfibrils become part of elastic fibers which enable the skin, ligaments, and blood vessels to stretch. Researchers have suggested that fibrillin-2 plays a role in directing the assembly of elastic fibers during embryonic development. Microfibrils also contribute to more rigid tissues that support the lens of the eye, nerves, and muscles. Additionally, microfibrils hold certain growth factors called transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) proteins, which keeps them inactive. When released from microfibrils, TGF-beta growth factors are activated and affect the growth and repair of tissues throughout the body.","Congenital contractural arachnodactyly More than 20 mutations in the FBN2 gene have been found to cause congenital contractural arachnodactyly. Most of these mutations change one protein building block (amino acid) in the fibrillin-2 protein, usually replacing the amino acid cysteine with a different amino acid. The substitution of another amino acid for cysteine can alter the structure or function of fibrillin-2. Most other FBN2 mutations disrupt the way the FBN2 gene's instructions are used to make the fibrillin-2 protein. All of these mutations reduce the amount of fibrillin-2 available to form microfibrils. Decreased microfibril formation probably weakens the elastic fibers and causes overactivation of TGF-beta growth factors, which leads to the signs and symptoms of congenital contractural arachnodactyly. "
479,FBXL4 ,F-box and leucine rich repeat protein 4,"The FBXL4 gene provides instructions for making a member of a family of proteins called F-box and leucine rich repeat proteins. Like other members of this family, FBXL4 associates with a group of proteins to form a complex. The protein complex that contains FBXL4 is found within cell structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria are involved in a wide variety of cellular activities, including energy production, chemical signaling, and regulation of cell growth and division (proliferation) and cell death (apoptosis). Mitochondria contain their own DNA, known as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is essential for the normal function of these structures. As part of the protein complex, the FBXL4 protein is likely involved in the maintenance of mtDNA. Having an adequate amount of mtDNA is essential for normal energy production within cells.","FBXL4-related encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome More than 47 mutations in the FBXL4 gene have been found to cause FBXL4-related encephalomyopathic mtDNA depletion syndrome. This condition affects multiple body systems and is often fatal in early childhood. It is primarily associated with brain dysfunction combined with muscle weakness (encephalomyopathy).Many of the mutations that cause FBXL4-related encephalomyopathic mtDNA depletion syndrome impair the FBXL4 protein's ability to attach (bind) to other proteins, disrupting the formation of the protein complex, which impairs normal maintenance of mtDNA. Problems with mtDNA maintenance can reduce the amount of mtDNA (known as mtDNA depletion). Depletion of mtDNA impairs mitochondrial function in many of the body's cells and tissues. Reduced mitochondrial function eventually leads to cell dysfunction, most noticeably affecting the brain, muscles, and other tissues that have high-energy requirements. This cell dysfunction leads to encephalomyopathy and other features of FBXL4-related encephalomyopathic mtDNA depletion syndrome. "
480,FECH ,ferrochelatase,"The FECH gene provides instructions for making an enzyme known as ferrochelatase. This enzyme is involved in the production of a molecule called heme. Heme is vital for all of the body's organs, although it is most abundant in the blood, bone marrow, and liver. Heme is an essential component of iron-containing proteins called hemoproteins, including hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in the blood).The production of heme is a multi-step process that requires eight different enzymes. Ferrochelatase is responsible for the eighth and final step in this process, in which an iron atom is inserted into the center of protoporphyrin IX (the product of the seventh step) to form heme.","Porphyria More than 110 mutations in the FECH gene have been identified in individuals with a form of porphyria called erythropoietic protoporphyria. A mutation in one copy of the FECH gene reduces each cell's production of ferrochelatase by about half. However, this is not enough to cause the signs and symptoms of porphyria; people with this disorder must also inherit a second altered copy of FECH. In some affected individuals, the second copy of the FECH gene is also nonfunctional, and cells make almost no ferrochelatase. In other affected individuals, the second copy of the FECH gene retains some of its function. This version of the gene is described as a low-expression allele. It reduces, but does not eliminate, the amount of ferrochelatase produced within cells. A combination of two mutated copies of the FECH gene in each cell, or one mutated copy of the gene and one low-expression allele, is necessary for erythropoietic protoporphyria to develop.A shortage of functional ferrochelatase allows compounds called porphyrins to build up in developing red blood cells. These compounds are formed during the normal process of heme production, but reduced activity of ferrochelatase allows them to accumulate to toxic levels. The excess porphyrins can leak out of developing red blood cells and be transported through the bloodstream to the skin and other tissues. High levels of these compounds in the skin cause the oversensitivity to sunlight that is characteristic of this condition. Large amounts of porphyrins in the gallbladder can also cause gallstones. Less commonly, a buildup of these compounds in the liver can result in liver damage. "
481,FERMT1 ,fermitin family member 1,"The FERMT1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called kindlin-1. This protein is found in epithelial cells, which are the cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body. In the skin, kindlin-1 plays a critical role in specialized cells called keratinocytes, which are the major component of the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis).Kindlin-1 is part of cell structures called focal adhesions. These structures contain many different kinds of proteins, which are involved in linking the cell's internal framework (the cytoskeleton) to the intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that surrounds cells (the extracellular matrix). This linking is known as cell-matrix adhesion. Kindlin-1 attaches (binds) to and turns on (activates) proteins called integrins, which directly connect the cytoskeleton with the extracellular matrix and help transmit chemical signals into the cell.As part of focal adhesions, Kindlin-1 is involved in several important cell functions, including cell growth and division (proliferation) and the movement (migration) of cells.","Kindler syndrome More than 70 mutations in the FERMT1 gene have been identified in people with Kindler syndrome. This disorder is a rare type of epidermolysis bullosa, which is a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily. Kindler syndrome also affects the moist lining (mucosae) of the mouth, eyes, esophagus, intestines, genitals, and urinary system, causing these tissues to be very fragile. In addition, people with Kindler syndrome have an increased risk of developing a form of cancer called squamous cell carcinoma.Most mutations in the FERMT1 gene prevent the production of any functional kindlin-1. A lack of this protein disrupts many essential cell functions. For example, keratinocytes without kindlin-1 have an abnormal structure and cannot grow or divide normally. They are also less able to attach the epidermis to the underlying layer of skin (the dermis). These changes make the skin fragile and prone to blistering. Similarly, a lack of kindlin-1 in epithelial cells of the mucosae causes damage that makes these tissues extremely fragile. It is unclear how a shortage of kindlin-1 is related to squamous cell carcinoma in people with Kindler syndrome. "
482,FGA ,fibrinogen alpha chain,"The FGA gene provides instructions for making a protein called the fibrinogen A alpha (Aα) chain, one piece (subunit) of the fibrinogen protein. This protein is important for blood clot formation (coagulation), which is needed to stop excessive bleeding after injury. To form fibrinogen, the Aα chain attaches to two other proteins called the fibrinogen B beta (Bβ) and fibrinogen gamma (γ) chains, each produced from different genes. Two sets of this three-protein complex combine to form functional fibrinogen.For coagulation to occur, another protein called thrombin removes a piece from the Aα and the Bβ subunits of the functional fibrinogen protein (the pieces are called the A and B fibrinopeptides). This process converts fibrinogen to fibrin, the main protein in blood clots. Fibrin proteins attach to each other, forming a stable network that makes up the blood clot.","Congenital afibrinogenemia Mutations in the FGA gene can lead to congenital afibrinogenemia, a condition that causes excessive bleeding due to the absence of fibrinogen protein in the blood. Most FGA gene mutations that cause this condition lead to an abnormally short blueprint for protein formation (mRNA). If any fibrinogen Aα chain is produced, it is nonfunctional. Because this condition occurs when both copies of the FGA gene are altered, there is a complete absence of functional fibrinogen Aα chain. Without the Aα subunit, the fibrinogen protein is not assembled, which results in the absence of fibrin. Consequently, blood clots do not form in response to injury, leading to the excessive bleeding seen in people with congenital afibrinogenemia. "
483,FGB ,fibrinogen beta chain,"The FGB gene provides instructions for making a protein called the fibrinogen B beta (Bβ) chain, one piece (subunit) of the fibrinogen protein. This protein is important for blood clot formation (coagulation), which is needed to stop excessive bleeding after injury. To form fibrinogen, the Bβ chain attaches to two other proteins called the fibrinogen A alpha (Aα) and fibrinogen gamma (γ) chains, each produced from different genes. Two sets of this three-protein complex combine to form functional fibrinogen.For coagulation to occur, another protein called thrombin removes a piece from the Aα and the Bβ subunits of the functional fibrinogen protein (the pieces are called the A and B fibrinopeptides). This process converts fibrinogen to fibrin, the main protein in blood clots. Fibrin proteins attach to each other, forming a stable network that makes up the blood clot.","Congenital afibrinogenemia Mutations in the FGB gene can lead to congenital afibrinogenemia, a condition that causes excessive bleeding due to the absence of fibrinogen protein in the blood. Most FGB gene mutations that cause this condition lead to an abnormally short blueprint for protein formation (mRNA). If any fibrinogen Bβ chain is produced, it is nonfunctional. Some mutations in the FGB gene result in the formation of a protein that cannot be released from the cell, making the protein effectively nonfunctional. Because this condition occurs when both copies of the FGB gene are altered, there is a complete absence of functional fibrinogen Bβ chain. Without the Bβ subunit, the fibrinogen protein is not assembled, which results in the absence of fibrin. As a result, blood clots do not form in response to injury, leading to excessive bleeding. "
484,FGD1 ,"FYVE, RhoGEF and PH domain containing 1","The FGD1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). GEFs turn on (activate) proteins called GTPases, which play an important role in chemical signaling within cells. GTPases are turned off (inactivated) when they are attached (bound) to a molecule called GDP and are turned on (activated) when they are bound to another molecule called GTP.The FGD1 protein activates the GTPase known as Cdc42 by stimulating the exchange of GDP for GTP. Once Cdc42 is active, it transmits signals that are critical for various aspects of development before and after birth, particularly the development of bones. The FGD1 protein may also be involved in maintenance (remodeling) of the extracellular matrix, which is the intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. Through this process, the protein appears to play a role in cell movement (migration) and the remodeling of blood vessels.","Aarskog-Scott syndrome More than 40 mutations in the FGD1 gene have been found to cause Aarskog-Scott syndrome, a rare condition that occurs primarily in males. Affected boys typically have distinctive facial features, genital abnormalities, childhood short stature, and other skeletal abnormalities. The FGD1 gene mutations lead to the production of an abnormally functioning FGD1 protein, which disrupts Cdc42 signaling. Altering the transmission of Cdc42 signals likely impairs normal development of bones and other tissues, resulting in the wide variety of abnormalities that occur in people with Aarskog-Scott syndrome. "
485,FGF3 ,fibroblast growth factor 3,"The FGF3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor 3 (FGF3). This protein is part of a family of proteins called fibroblast growth factors that are involved in important processes such as cell division, regulation of cell growth and maturation, formation of blood vessels, wound healing, and development before birth. By attaching to another protein known as a receptor, FGF3 triggers a cascade of chemical reactions inside the cell that signal the cell to undergo certain changes, such as maturing to take on specialized functions. During development before birth, the signals triggered by the FGF3 protein stimulate cells to form the structures that make up the inner ears. The FGF3 protein is also involved in the development of many other organs and structures, including the outer ears and teeth.","Congenital deafness with labyrinthine aplasia, microtia, and microdontia Mutations in the FGF3 gene cause a condition known as congenital deafness with labyrinthine aplasia, microtia, and microdontia (also known as LAMM syndrome). The features of this condition include deafness caused by a lack of inner ear structures (labyrinthine aplasia), small outer ears (microtia), and small teeth (microdontia). The gene mutations involved in LAMM syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the FGF3 protein or lead to an abnormally short protein. The altered protein likely has reduced or absent function, making it unable to stimulate signaling within cells. The loss of FGF3 function impairs development of the ears and teeth, which leads to the characteristic features of LAMM syndrome. "
486,FGF8 ,fibroblast growth factor 8,"The FGF8 gene provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8). This protein is part of a family of proteins called fibroblast growth factors that are involved in many processes, including cell division, regulation of cell growth and maturation, and development before birth. FGF8 attaches (binds) to another protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) on the cell surface, which triggers a cascade of chemical reactions inside the cell.Starting before birth, the signals triggered by FGF8 and FGFR1 play a critical role in the formation, survival, and movement (migration) of certain nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. In particular, this signaling appears to be essential for neurons that produce a hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH controls the production of several other hormones that direct sexual development before birth and during puberty. These hormones are important for the normal function of the ovaries in women and the testes in men. FGF8 and FGFR1 also play a role in a group of nerve cells that are specialized to process smells (olfactory neurons). These neurons migrate from the developing nose to a structure at the front of the brain called the olfactory bulb, which is critical for the perception of odors.The FGF8 protein is also found in other parts of the developing embryo, including other areas of the brain and the limbs, heart, ears, and eyes. Researchers suspect that it may be involved in the normal formation and development of these structures as well.","Kallmann syndrome At least seven mutations in the FGF8 gene have been identified in people with Kallmann syndrome, a disorder characterized by the combination of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (a condition affecting the production of hormones that direct sexual development) and an impaired sense of smell. This condition can also affect other body systems, and its features vary among affected individuals. Researchers estimate that mutations in the FGF8 gene account for a small percentage of all cases of Kallmann syndrome.Most of the FGF8 gene mutations that cause Kallmann syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the FGF8 protein. These mutations reduce or eliminate the protein's function, including its ability to bind to FGFR1. Studies suggest that a shortage of functional FGF8 disrupts the migration and survival of olfactory neurons and GnRH-producing neurons in the developing brain. If olfactory nerve cells do not extend to the olfactory bulb, a person's sense of smell will be impaired or absent. Misplacement or premature loss of GnRH-producing neurons prevents the production of sex hormones, which interferes with normal sexual development and causes puberty to be delayed or absent.Some people with Kallmann syndrome resulting from FGF8 gene mutations have additional features, such as a split in the lip (cleft lip) with an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), and a condition called bimanual synkinesis, in which the movements of one hand are mirrored by the other hand. It is unclear how mutations in the FGF8 gene lead to these other signs and symptoms. Because these features vary among individuals, researchers suspect that other genetic and environmental factors may be involved. Some affected individuals have mutations in one of several other genes in addition to FGF8, and these genetic changes may contribute to the varied features of the condition. "
487,FGF10 ,fibroblast growth factor 10,"The FGF10 gene provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10). This protein is part of a family of proteins called fibroblast growth factors that are involved in important processes such as cell division, regulation of cell growth and maturation, formation of blood vessels, wound healing, and development before birth. By attaching to another protein known as a receptor, the FGF10 protein triggers a cascade of chemical reactions inside the cell that signals the cell to undergo certain changes, such as maturing to take on specialized functions. During development before birth, the signals triggered by the FGF10 protein appear to stimulate cells to form the structures that make up the ears, skeleton, organs, and glands in the eyes and mouth.","Lacrimo-auriculo-dento-digital syndrome At least three mutations in the FGF10 gene have been found to cause lacrimo-auriculo-dento-digital (LADD) syndrome. This disorder affects the formation of the lacrimal system (the system in the eyes that produces and secretes tears), the ears, the salivary glands (the glands in the mouth that produce saliva), the teeth, the hands, and sometimes, other parts of the body. The main features of LADD syndrome are abnormal tear production, malformed ears with hearing loss, decreased saliva production, small teeth, and hand deformities.The FGF10 gene mutations that cause LADD syndrome reduce the amount and activity of FGF10 protein. Less growth factor is available to bind to receptors, which decreases signaling within cells. A decrease in cell signaling disrupts cell maturation and development, which results in abnormal formation of the ears, skeleton, and glands in the eyes and mouth in people with LADD syndrome. "
488,FGF23 ,fibroblast growth factor 23,"The FGF23 gene provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor 23, which is produced in bone cells. This protein is necessary in regulating the phosphate levels within the body (phosphate homeostasis). Among its many functions, phosphate plays a critical role in the formation and growth of bones in childhood and helps maintain bone strength in adults. Phosphate levels are controlled in large part by the kidneys. The kidneys normally rid the body of excess phosphate by excreting it in urine, and they reabsorb this mineral into the bloodstream when more is needed. Fibroblast growth factor 23 signals the kidneys to stop reabsorbing phosphate into the bloodstream.In order to function, fibroblast growth factor 23 must be released (secreted) from the cell and it must attach (bind) to a receptor protein. To be secreted from the cell, sugar molecules are attached to fibroblast growth factor 23 by another protein called ppGalNacT3 in a process called glycosylation. Glycosylation allows fibroblast growth factor 23 to move out of the cell and protects the protein from being broken down. Once outside the bone cell, the protein must bind to a receptor protein called FGF receptor 1 that spans the membrane of kidney cells. Binding of fibroblast growth factor 23 to its receptor stimulates signaling that stops phosphate reabsorption into the bloodstream.Studies suggest that fibroblast growth factor 23 has additional functions. It helps determine how much phosphate from the diet is absorbed by the intestines and plays a role in regulating vitamin D.Fibroblast growth factor 23 is normally cut (cleaved) at a certain site, which turns off (inactivates) the protein. The cleavage site is located at positions 179 to 180 in the string of building blocks (amino acids) that make up the protein. This cleavage helps regulate the amount of active fibroblast growth factor 23 circulating in the bloodstream.","Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets At least three mutations in the FGF23 gene have been found to cause a rare form of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets known as autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets. These mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in fibroblast growth factor 23, which prevents the protein from being cleaved. As a result, the protein is not inactivated, and an increased amount of the full-length, active protein circulates in the bloodstream. Overactivity of fibroblast growth factor 23 reduces phosphate reabsorption by the kidneys, leading to low levels of phosphate in the blood (hypophosphatemia) and related problems with bone growth in people with autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets. "
489,FGFR1 ,fibroblast growth factor receptor 1,"The FGFR1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 1. This protein is one of four fibroblast growth factor receptors, which are related proteins that are involved in processes such as cell division, regulation of cell growth and maturation, formation of blood vessels, wound healing, and embryonic development.The FGFR1 protein spans the cell membrane, so that one end of the protein is inside the cell and the other end projects from the outer surface of the cell. This positioning allows the FGFR1 protein to interact with other proteins called fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) outside the cell and to receive signals that help the cell respond to its environment. When an FGF attaches to the FGFR1 protein, the receptor triggers a cascade of chemical reactions inside the cell that instruct the cell to undergo certain changes, such as maturing to take on specialized functions. This signaling is thought to play an important role in the development and growth of several parts of the body, including the brain, bones of the head and face (craniofacial bones), bones in the hands and feet, and the long bones in the arms and legs.Signaling through the FGFR1 protein plays a critical role in the formation, survival, and movement (migration) of nerve cells (neurons) in several areas of in the brain. In particular, this signaling appears to be essential for neurons that produce a hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH controls the production of several other hormones that direct sexual development before birth and during puberty. These hormones are important for the normal function of the ovaries in women and the testes in men. FGFR1 also appears to play a role in a group of nerve cells that are specialized to process smells (olfactory neurons). These neurons migrate from the developing nose to a structure at the front of the brain called the olfactory bulb, which is critical for the perception of odors.","8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome The FGFR1 gene is involved in a type of blood cancer called 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome. This condition is characterized by an increased number of white blood cells (myeloproliferative disorder) and the development of lymphoma, a blood-related cancer that causes tumor formation in the lymph nodes. The myeloproliferative disorder usually develops into another form of blood cancer called acute myeloid leukemia. 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome results from a rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosome 8 and another chromosome, which fuses part of the FGFR1 gene with part of another gene from the other chromosome. The most common partner gene is ZMYM2 on chromosome 13. These translocations are found only in cancer cells.Regardless of the partner gene, the protein produced from the fused gene turns on FGFR1 signaling without the need for stimulation from growth factors. The uncontrolled signaling promotes continuous cell growth and division, leading to cancer. "
490,FGFR2 ,fibroblast growth factor receptor 2,"The FGFR2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). Fibroblast growth factor receptors are related proteins that are involved in important processes such as cell growth and division (proliferation), cell maturation (differentiation), formation of blood vessels (angiogenesis), wound healing, and embryonic development.The FGFR2 protein spans the outer membrane surrounding cells, so that one end of the protein remains inside the cell and the other end projects from the outer surface of the cell. This positioning allows the FGFR2 protein to interact with specific growth factors outside the cell and to receive signals that help the cell respond to its environment. When growth factors attach to the FGFR2 protein, the receptor triggers a series of chemical reactions inside the cell that instruct the cell to undergo certain changes, such as maturing to take on specialized functions.The FGFR2 protein plays an important role in bone growth, particularly during development before birth (embryonic development). For example, this protein signals certain immature cells in the developing embryo to become bone cells and form the head, hands, feet, and other tissues.There are several slightly different versions (isoforms) of the FGFR2 protein. Specific patterns of these isoforms are found in the body's tissues, and these patterns may change throughout growth and development.","Apert syndrome At least ten mutations in the FGFR2 gene have been found to cause Apert syndrome. This condition causes premature closure of the bones of the skull (craniosynostosis), leading to a misshapen head, distinctive facial features, and brain abnormalities. Affected individuals often have abnormalities of the fingers and toes, hearing and vision problems, and other signs and symptoms.More than 98 percent of cases of Apert syndrome are caused by one of two mutations in the FGFR2 gene. These mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the FGFR2 protein. One mutation replaces the amino acid serine with the amino acid tryptophan at protein position 252 (written as Ser252Trp). The other mutation replaces the amino acid proline with the amino acid arginine at position 253 (written as Pro253Arg). These changes are described as ""gain-of-function"" because they increase the activity of the protein, leading to stronger signaling, which causes cells to mature too quickly. As a result, structures in the body develop abnormally, leading to premature fusion of bones in the skull, hands, and feet and other characteristic features of Apert syndrome. "
491,FGFR3 ,fibroblast growth factor receptor 3,"The FGFR3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. This protein is part of a family of four fibroblast growth factor receptors that share similar structures and functions. These proteins play a role in several important cellular processes, including regulation of cell growth and division (proliferation), determination of cell type, formation of blood vessels (angiogenesis), wound healing, and embryo development.The FGFR3 protein spans the cell membrane, so that one end of the protein remains inside the cell and the other end projects from the outer surface of the cell. This positioning of the protein allows it to interact with specific growth factors outside the cell and to receive signals that control growth and development. When these growth factors attach to the FGFR3 protein, the protein is turned on (activated), which triggers a cascade of chemical reactions inside the cell that instruct the cell to undergo certain changes, such as maturing to take on specialized functions (differentiation).Several versions (isoforms) of the FGFR3 protein are produced from the FGFR3 gene. The different isoforms are found in various tissues of the body, and they interact with a variety of growth factors. Many isoforms are found in the cells that form bones. Researchers believe that the FGFR3 protein regulates bone growth by limiting the formation of bone from cartilage (a process called ossification), particularly in the long bones. One particular isoform of the FGFR3 protein is found specifically in cells that line the surfaces of the body (epithelial cells), including the cells that form the outermost layer of skin, called the epidermis.","Achondroplasia Two mutations in the FGFR3 gene cause more than 99 percent of cases of achondroplasia, which is a form of short-limbed dwarfism. Both mutations lead to the same change in the FGFR3 protein. Specifically, the protein building block (amino acid) glycine is replaced with the amino acid arginine at protein position 380 (written as Gly380Arg or G380R). Researchers believe that this genetic change causes the receptor to be overly active, which leads to the disturbances in bone growth that occur in this disorder. "
492,FGFR4 ,fibroblast growth factor receptor 4,"The FGFR4 gene provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 4. This protein is part of a family of fibroblast growth factor receptors that share similar structures and functions. These receptor proteins play a role in important processes such as cell division, regulating cell growth and maturation, formation of blood vessels, wound healing, and embryo development.The FGFR4 protein interacts with specific growth factors to conduct signals from the environment outside the cell to the nucleus. The nucleus responds to these signals by switching on or off appropriate genes that help the cell adjust to changes in the environment. In response, the cell might divide, move, or mature to take on specialized functions. Although specific functions of FGFR4 remain unclear, studies indicate that the gene is involved in muscle development and the maturation of bone cells in the skull. The FGFR4 gene may also play a role in the development and maintenance of specialized cells (called foveal cones) in the light-sensitive layer (the retina) at the back of the eye.",Prostate cancer Genetics Home Reference provides information about prostate cancer. 
493,FGG ,fibrinogen gamma chain,"The FGG gene provides instructions for making the fibrinogen gamma (γ) chain, one piece (subunit) of the fibrinogen protein. This protein is important for blood clot formation (coagulation), which is needed to stop excessive bleeding after injury. To form fibrinogen, the γ chain attaches to the fibrinogen A alpha (Aα) and fibrinogen B beta (Bβ) chains, each produced from different genes. Two sets of this three-protein complex combine to form functional fibrinogen.For coagulation to occur, another protein called thrombin removes a piece from the Aα and the Bβ subunits of the functional fibrinogen protein (the pieces are called the A and B fibrinopeptides). This process converts fibrinogen to fibrin, the main protein in blood clots. Fibrin proteins attach to each other, forming a stable network that makes up the blood clot.","Congenital afibrinogenemia Mutations in the FGG gene can lead to congenital afibrinogenemia, a condition that causes excessive bleeding due to the absence of fibrinogen protein in the blood. Most FGG gene mutations that cause this condition lead to an abnormally short blueprint for protein formation (mRNA). If any fibrinogen γ chain is produced, it is nonfunctional. Because this condition occurs when both copies of the FGG gene are altered, there is a complete absence of functional fibrinogen γ chain. Without the γ subunit, the fibrinogen protein is not assembled, which results in the absence of fibrin. As a result, blood clots do not form in response to injury, leading to the excessive bleeding seen in people with congenital afibrinogenemia. "
494,FH ,fumarate hydratase,"The FH gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called fumarase (also known as fumarate hydratase). Fumarase participates in an important series of reactions known as the citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle, which allows cells to use oxygen and generate energy. Specifically, fumarase helps convert a molecule called fumarate to a molecule called malate.","Fumarase deficiency More than 20 FH gene mutations have been identified in people with fumarase deficiency, a condition that primarily affects the brain and is often fatal in infancy. Fumarase deficiency occurs in individuals who inherit two mutated copies of the FH gene in each cell. Most of these mutations replace one protein building block (amino acid) with another amino acid in the fumarase enzyme. These changes disrupt the ability of the enzyme to help convert fumarate to malate, interfering with the function of this reaction in the citric acid cycle. Impairment of the process that generates energy for cells is particularly harmful to cells in the developing brain, and this impairment results in the signs and symptoms of fumarase deficiency. "
495,FHL1 ,four and a half LIM domains 1,"The FHL1 gene provides instructions for making three versions (isoforms) of a protein that plays an important role in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles) and in the heart (cardiac muscle). The full-length isoform is known as FHL1A, or sometimes just FHL1. The other two isoforms, which are shorter, are called FHL1B and FHL1C.FHL1A is the best-studied of the three FHL1 isoforms. Studies suggest that interactions between FHL1A and other proteins play a critical role in the assembly of sarcomeres, which are structures within muscle cells that are necessary for muscle tensing (contraction). These interactions also appear to be involved in chemical signaling within muscle cells, maintaining the structure of these cells, and influencing muscle growth and size.Less is known about the FHL1B and FHL1C isoforms. FHL1B moves in and out of the nucleus and is also part of the nuclear envelope, which is a structure that surrounds the nucleus in cells. The protein's function in this structure is unknown. FHL1B and FHL1C are suspected to play roles in the normal structure and function of skeletal and cardiac muscles.","Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy At least seven mutations in the FHL1 gene have been found to cause Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. This condition affects skeletal and cardiac muscle, causing joint deformities called contractures, which restrict the movement of certain joints; muscle weakness and wasting that worsen over time; and heart problems, including an increased risk of sudden death.Some of the FHL1 gene mutations that cause Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the FHL1 protein, while others insert or delete a small amount of DNA from the FHL1 gene. All of the known mutations affect the FHL1A isoform. Depending on where the mutations occur, they may affect one or both of the other isoforms as well.Studies suggest that mutations reduce the amount of functional FHL1 protein produced in cells or lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the protein. A shortage of this protein disrupts the normal structure and function of cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. However, the exact mechanism by which these changes cause joint contractures, muscle weakness and wasting, and heart problems remains unknown. "
496,FIP1L1 ,FIP1 like 1 (S. cerevisiae),"The FIP1L1 gene provides instructions for making part of a protein complex named cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF). This complex of proteins plays an important role in processing molecules called messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which serve as the genetic blueprints for making proteins. The CPSF protein complex helps add a string of the RNA building block adenine to the mRNA, creating a polyadenine tail or poly(A) tail. The poly(A) tail is important for stability of the mRNA and for protein production from the blueprint.","PDGFRA-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia A deletion of genetic material from chromosome 4 brings together part of the FIP1L1 gene and part of another gene called PDGFRA, creating the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene. This mutation is a somatic mutation, which means it is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in certain cells. This fusion gene causes PDGFRA-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia, which is a type of blood cell cancer characterized by an increased number of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell involved in allergic reactions.The FIP1L1-PDGFRA protein produced from the fusion gene has the function of the normal PDGFRA protein, which stimulates signaling pathways inside the cell that control many important cellular processes, such as cell growth and division (proliferation) and cell survival. Unlike the normal PDGFRA protein, however, the FIP1L1-PDGFRA protein is constantly turned on (constitutively activated), which means the cells are always receiving signals to proliferate. When the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene occurs in blood cell precursors, the growth of eosinophils (and occasionally other blood cells) is poorly controlled, leading to PDGFRA-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia. It is unclear why eosinophils are preferentially affected by this genetic change. "
497,FKBP10 ,FKBP prolyl isomerase 10,"The FKBP10 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein production, processing, and transport. The FKBP10 protein (formerly known as FKBP65) is important for the correct processing of complex molecules called collagen and elastin, which are part of the intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells (the extracellular matrix). This matrix provides structure and strength to connective tissues that support the body's joints and organs.In the extracellular matrix, collagen molecules are cross-linked to one another to form long, thin fibrils. The formation of cross-links results in very strong collagen fibrils. The FKBP10 protein attaches to collagen molecules and plays a role in their cross-linking. It is thought to be involved in a reaction called hydroxylation that modifies a particular region of the collagen molecule and is necessary for cross-linking of the molecules.The FKBP10 protein is also involved in the formation of elastin. In particular, FKBP10 helps with the proper folding of a protein called tropoelastin. Multiple copies of tropoelastin attach to one another to make elastin. Elastin is the major component of elastic fibers, which provide strength and elasticity to connective tissues as part of the extracellular matrix.","Kuskokwim syndrome At least one mutation in the FKBP10 gene causes Kuskokwim syndrome, a rare condition that affects a small number of people from the Yup'ik Eskimo population in southwest Alaska. This condition is characterized by joint deformities called contractures, particularly in the knees, ankles, and elbows. The contractures restrict the movement of affected joints.The FKBP10 gene mutation involved in Kuskokwim syndrome deletes a single protein building block (amino acid) from the FKBP10 protein. The mutation, written as Tyr293del, removes the amino acid tyrosine at position 293. This genetic change leads to production of a protein that is unstable and easily broken down. As a result, people with Kuskokwim syndrome have only about 5 percent of the normal amount of FKBP10 protein. Although the mechanism is unclear, the reduction of FKBP10 protein leads to a severe decrease in collagen hydroxylation, which interferes with collagen cross-linking. The network of collagen molecules in affected individuals is disorganized. It is unclear how changes in the collagen matrix are involved in the development of joint contractures in people with Kuskokwim syndrome. It is unknown whether elastin abnormalities also contribute to the features of this disorder. "
498,FKBP14 ,FKBP prolyl isomerase 14,"The FKBP14 gene provides instructions for making a protein called FKBP prolyl isomerase 14 (also known as FKBP22). This protein is found in a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is involved in protein processing and transport. Among its many functions, the endoplasmic reticulum folds and modifies newly formed proteins so they have the 3-dimensional shape they need to function properly. FKBP prolyl isomerase 14 is thought to assist with protein folding, particularly the folding of procollagens. Procollagens are the precursors of collagens, which are complex molecules found in the spaces between cells (the extracellular matrix) that add strength, support, and stretchiness (elasticity) to organs and tissues throughout the body. Studies suggest that FKBP prolyl isomerase 14 may also play a role in processing other components of the extracellular matrix.","Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Mutations in the FKBP14 gene are one cause of a rare form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome called the kyphoscoliotic type (kEDS-FKBP14). Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect the connective tissues supporting the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues. The kyphoscoliotic type is characterized by an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility); weak muscle tone (hypotonia); severe, progressive curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis) that can interfere with breathing; and fragile blood vessels that can tear (rupture), leading to internal bleeding. When the kyphoscoliotic type is caused by FKBP14 gene mutations, affected individuals may also have muscle wasting (atrophy) and hearing loss that is present from birth.At least four FKBP14 gene mutations have been found to cause the kyphoscoliotic type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. These mutations, which affect both copies of the gene in each cell, abnormally copy (duplicate) or delete a small amount of DNA from the gene. The extra or missing genetic material prevents the gene from making functional FKBP prolyl isomerase 14. A loss of this protein disrupts the activities of the endoplasmic reticulum, including folding procollagens and processing other components of the extracellular matrix. As a result, the extracellular matrix becomes disorganized, which weakens connective tissues throughout the body and leads to the signs and symptoms of the disorder. "
499,FKRP ,fukutin related protein,"The FKRP gene provides instructions for making a protein called fukutin-related protein (FKRP). This protein is present in many of the body's tissues but is particularly abundant in the brain, heart (cardiac) muscle, and muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). Within cells, FKRP is found in a specialized structure called the Golgi apparatus, where newly produced proteins are modified.FKRP is involved in a process called glycosylation. Through this chemical process, sugar molecules are added to certain proteins. In particular, FKRP adds a molecule called ribitol 5-phosphate to the chain of sugars attached to a protein called alpha (α)-dystroglycan. Glycosylation is critical for the normal function of α-dystroglycan.The α-dystroglycan protein helps anchor the structural framework inside each cell (cytoskeleton) to the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell (extracellular matrix). In skeletal muscles, glycosylated α-dystroglycan helps stabilize and protect muscle fibers. In the brain, it helps direct the movement (migration) of nerve cells (neurons) during early development.","Walker-Warburg syndrome At least five mutations in the FKRP gene have been found to cause Walker-Warburg syndrome. This condition is the most severe form of a group of disorders known as congenital muscular dystrophies. Walker-Warburg syndrome causes skeletal muscle weakness and abnormalities of the brain and eyes. Because of the severity of the problems caused by this condition, affected individuals usually do not survive past early childhood.Many FKRP gene mutations involved in Walker-Warburg syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in FKRP. The altered protein cannot reach the Golgi apparatus and is instead broken down, reducing the amount of functional FKRP.A shortage of FKRP prevents the normal glycosylation of α-dystroglycan. As a result, α-dystroglycan can no longer effectively anchor cells to the proteins and other molecules that surround them. Without functional α-dystroglycan to stabilize the muscle fibers, they become damaged as they repeatedly contract and relax with use. The damaged fibers weaken and die over time, which affects the development, structure, and function of skeletal muscles in people with Walker-Warburg syndrome.Defective α-dystroglycan also affects the migration of neurons during the early development of the brain. Instead of stopping when they reach their intended destinations, some neurons migrate past the surface of the brain into the fluid-filled space that surrounds it. Researchers believe that this problem with neuronal migration causes a brain abnormality called cobblestone lissencephaly, in which the surface of the brain lacks the normal folds and grooves and instead appears bumpy and irregular. Less is known about the effects of FKRP gene mutations in other parts of the body. "
500,FKTN ,fukutin,"The FKTN gene (formerly known as FCMD) provides instructions for making a protein called fukutin. This protein is present in many of the body's tissues but is particularly abundant in heart (cardiac) muscle, the brain, and the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). Within cells, fukutin is found in a specialized structure called the Golgi apparatus, where newly produced proteins are modified.The fukutin protein is involved in a protein modification process called glycosylation. Through this chemical process, sugar molecules are added to certain proteins. In particular, the fukutin protein adds a molecule called ribitol 5-phosphate to the chain of sugars attached to a protein called alpha (α)-dystroglycan. Glycosylation is critical for the normal function of α-dystroglycan.The α-dystroglycan protein helps anchor the structural framework inside each cell (cytoskeleton) to the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell (extracellular matrix). In skeletal muscles, glycosylated α-dystroglycan helps stabilize and protect muscle fibers. In the brain, it helps direct the movement (migration) of nerve cells (neurons) during early development.","Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy At least 18 mutations in the FKTN gene have been found to cause Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy, a condition that causes skeletal muscle weakness and brain and eye abnormalities. This form of congenital muscular dystrophy is seen almost exclusively in Japan. Virtually everyone with this condition has at least one copy of the same mutation, an insertion of about 3,000 extra DNA building blocks (3 kilobases [kb]) in the FKTN gene. This insertion occurs in a part of the gene known as the 3' untranslated region, which helps regulate the gene's activity. Researchers believe that the 3-kb insertion reduces the amount of fukutin protein that is produced from the gene.A shortage of fukutin prevents the normal glycosylation of α-dystroglycan. As a result, α-dystroglycan can no longer effectively anchor cells to the proteins and other molecules that surround them. Without functional α-dystroglycan to stabilize the muscle fibers, they become damaged as they repeatedly contract and relax with use. The damaged fibers weaken and die over time, which affects the development, structure, and function of skeletal muscles in people with Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy.Defective α-dystroglycan also affects the migration of neurons during the early development of the brain. Instead of stopping when they reach their intended destinations, some neurons migrate past the surface of the brain into the fluid-filled space that surrounds it. Researchers believe that this problem with neuronal migration causes a brain abnormality called cobblestone lissencephaly, in which the surface of the brain lacks the normal folds and grooves and instead appears bumpy and irregular. Less is known about the effects of FKTN mutations in other parts of the body. "
501,FLCN ,folliculin,"The FLCN gene provides instructions for making a protein called folliculin. Researchers have not determined the protein's function, but they believe it may act as a tumor suppressor. Tumor suppressors help control the growth and division of cells.The folliculin protein is present in many of the body's tissues, including the brain, heart, placenta, testis, skin, lung, and kidney. Researchers have proposed several possible roles for the protein within cells. Folliculin may be important for cells' uptake of foreign particles (endocytosis or phagocytosis). The protein may also play a role in the structural framework that helps to define the shape, size, and movement of a cell (the cytoskeleton) and in interactions between cells. In the lung, it is thought that folliculin plays a role in repairing and re-forming lung tissue following damage.","Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome Several mutations in the FLCN gene have been identified in people with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, a condition characterized by multiple noncancerous (benign) skin tumors, an increased risk of other tumors, and lung cysts. Most of these mutations insert or delete one or more protein building blocks (amino acids) in the folliculin protein. These mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of this protein. Without folliculin, researchers believe that cells can grow and divide uncontrollably to form cancerous or noncancerous tumors. They have not determined how a loss of folliculin increases the risk of lung abnormalities that are often associated with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome. "
502,FLG ,filaggrin,"The FLG gene provides instructions for making a large protein called profilaggrin, which is found in cells that make up the outermost layer of skin (the epidermis). Profilaggrin is cut (cleaved) to produce multiple copies of the filaggrin protein, which is important for the structure of the epidermis. The profilaggrin molecule can contain 10, 11, or 12 copies of the filaggrin protein, depending on the genetics of the individual. Further processing of the filaggrin protein produces other molecules that play a role in hydration of the skin.The epidermis acts as a barrier to help minimize water loss and protect the body from foreign substances, including toxins, bacteria, and substances that can cause allergic reactions (allergens), such as pollen and dust mites. Filaggrin plays an important role in the skin's barrier function. It brings together structural proteins in the outermost skin cells to form tight bundles, flattening and strengthening the cells to create a strong barrier. In addition, processing of filaggrin proteins leads to production of molecules that are part of the skin's ""natural moisturizing factor,"" which helps maintain hydration of the skin. These molecules also maintain the correct acidity (pH) of the skin, which is another important aspect of the barrier.",Alopecia areata Genetics Home Reference provides information about alopecia areata. 
503,FLI1 ,"Fli-1 proto-oncogene, ETS transcription factor","The FLI1 gene provides instructions for making the FLI protein, which controls the activity (transcription) of genes. Transcription is the first step in the process of producing proteins. The FLI protein is part of a group of related proteins, called the Ets family of transcription factors, that control transcription. The FLI protein attaches (binds) to certain regions of DNA and turns on (activates) the transcription of nearby genes. The proteins produced from these genes control many important cellular processes, such as cell growth and division (proliferation), maturation (differentiation), and survival. The FLI protein is found primarily in blood cells and is thought to regulate their development.","Ewing sarcoma Mutations involving the FLI1 gene cause a type of cancerous tumor known as Ewing sarcoma. These tumors develop in bones or soft tissues such as nerves and cartilage. There are several types of Ewing sarcoma, including Ewing sarcoma of bone, extraosseous Ewing sarcoma, peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor, and Askin tumor. The mutations that cause these tumors are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in the tumor cells. This type of genetic change, called a somatic mutation, is not inherited. The most common mutation that causes Ewing sarcoma is a rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosome 11 and chromosome 22. This translocation, written as t(11;22), fuses part of the FLI1 gene on chromosome 11 with part of another gene called EWSR1 on chromosome 22, creating an EWSR1/FLI1 fusion gene.The protein produced from the EWSR1/FLI1 fusion gene, called EWS/FLI, has functions of the protein products of both genes. Like the FLI protein, the EWS protein, produced from the EWSR1 gene, can regulate transcription. The EWS/FLI protein has the DNA-binding function of the FLI protein as well as the transcription regulation function of the EWS protein. It is thought that the EWS/FLI protein turns the transcription of a variety of genes on and off abnormally. This dysregulation of transcription leads to uncontrolled growth and division (proliferation) and abnormal maturation and survival of cells, causing tumor development.The EWSR1/FLI1 fusion gene occurs in approximately 85 percent of Ewing sarcomas. The remaining tumors result from translocations that fuse the EWSR1 gene with other genes. "
504,FLNA ,filamin A,"The FLNA gene provides instructions for producing the protein filamin A, which helps build cells' extensive internal network of protein filaments called the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton gives structure to cells and allows them the flexibility to change shape. Filamin A primarily attaches (binds) to another protein called actin and helps it form the branching network of filaments that make up the cytoskeleton. Filamin A can also bind to many other proteins in the cell to carry out various functions, including the attachment of cells to one another (cell adhesion), cell movement (migration), determination of cell shape, and cell survival. These numerous functions involving filamin A have been found to play roles in regulating skeletal and brain development, the formation of heart tissue and blood vessels, and blood clotting.Filamin A is also involved in the organization of the extracellular matrix, which is the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell. Filamin A binds to proteins called integrins, which span the cell membrane and anchor cells to the extracellular matrix. Through this binding, cells are correctly positioned and signals can be exchanged between the cell and the extracellular matrix.","Frontometaphyseal dysplasia More than 15 mutations in regions of the FLNA gene called exons 4, 22, 29, 33, and 44 through 46 have been identified in people with frontometaphyseal dysplasia. This condition involves abnormalities in skeletal development and other health problems, including kidney, heart, and lung defects. The FLNA gene mutations that cause frontometaphyseal dysplasia are described as ""gain of function"" because they appear to enhance the activity of the filamin A protein or give the protein a new, atypical function. Different mutations in the FLNA gene appear to produce specific changes in the protein, resulting in particular signs and symptoms that are classified as individual FLNA-related disorders. Researchers believe that the mutations involved in frontometaphyseal dysplasia may change the way the filamin A protein helps regulate processes involved in skeletal development, but it is not known how changes in the protein relate to the specific signs and symptoms of the condition. "
505,FLNB ,filamin B,"The FLNB gene provides instructions for making a protein called filamin B. This protein helps build the network of protein filaments (cytoskeleton) that gives structure to cells and allows them to change shape and move. Filamin B attaches (binds) to another protein called actin and helps the actin to form the branching network of filaments that makes up the cytoskeleton. It also links actin to many other proteins to perform various functions within the cell, including the cell signaling that helps determine how the cytoskeleton will change as tissues grow and take shape during development.Filamin B is involved in the development of the skeleton before birth. It is active (expressed) in many cells and tissues of the body, including cartilage-forming cells called chondrocytes. Cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone (a process called ossification), except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose, airways (trachea and bronchi), and external ears. Filamin B appears to be important for normal cell growth and division (proliferation) and maturation (differentiation) of chondrocytes and for the ossification of cartilage.","Atelosteogenesis type 1 At least seven FLNB gene mutations have been identified that cause atelosteogenesis type 1, a disorder that affects the development of bones throughout the body. The mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the filamin B protein or delete a small section of the protein sequence, resulting in an abnormal protein. This abnormal protein appears to have a new, atypical function that interferes with normal proliferation or differentiation of chondrocytes, impairing ossification and leading to the signs and symptoms of atelosteogenesis type 1. "
506,FLT3 ,fms related tyrosine kinase 3,"The FLT3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), which is part of a family of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Receptor tyrosine kinases transmit signals from the cell surface into the cell through a process called signal transduction. The FLT3 protein is found in the outer membrane of certain cell types where a specific protein called FLT3 ligand, or FL, can attach (bind) to it. This binding turns on (activates) the FLT3 protein, which subsequently activates a series of proteins inside the cell that are part of multiple signaling pathways. The signaling pathways stimulated by the FLT3 protein control many important cellular processes such as the growth and division (proliferation) and survival of cells, particularly of early blood cells called hematopoietic progenitor cells.",Core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia Genetics Home Reference provides information about core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia. 
507,FLT4 ,fms related tyrosine kinase 4,"The FLT4 gene provides instructions for making a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3), which regulates the development and maintenance of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system produces and transports fluids and immune cells throughout the body. VEGFR-3 is turned on (activated) by two proteins called vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) and vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGF-D). When VEGF-C and VEGF-D attach (bind) to VEGFR-3, chemical signals are produced that regulate the growth, movement, and survival of lymphatic cells.","Milroy disease At least 19 mutations in the FLT4 gene have been found to cause Milroy disease. Most mutations in this gene change a single protein building block (amino acid) in regions known as tyrosine kinase domains. Mutations in these regions disrupt VEGFR-3 signaling and cause the tubes that carry lymph fluid (lymphatic vessels) to be small or absent. If lymph fluid is not properly transported, it builds up in the body's tissues and causes swelling (lymphedema). It is not known how mutations in the FLT4 gene lead to the other signs and symptoms of Milroy disease. "
508,FMO3 ,flavin containing monooxygenase 3,"The FMO3 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is part of a larger enzyme family called flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs). These enzymes break down compounds that contain nitrogen, sulfur, or phosphorus. The FMO3 enzyme, which is made chiefly in the liver, is responsible for breaking down nitrogen-containing compounds derived from the diet. One of these compounds is trimethylamine, which is the molecule that gives fish their fishy smell. Trimethylamine is produced as bacteria in the intestine help digest certain proteins obtained from eggs, liver, legumes (such as soybeans and peas), certain kinds of fish, and other foods. The FMO3 enzyme normally converts fishy-smelling trimethylamine into another compound, trimethylamine-N-oxide, which has no odor. Trimethylamine-N-oxide is then excreted from the body in urine.Researchers believe that the FMO3 enzyme also plays a role in processing some types of drugs. For example, this enzyme is likely needed to break down the anticancer drug tamoxifen, the pain medication codeine, the antifungal drug ketoconazole, and certain medications used to treat depression (antidepressants). The FMO3 enzyme may also be involved in processing nicotine, an addictive chemical found in tobacco. Normal variations (polymorphisms) in the FMO3 gene may affect the enzyme's ability to break down these substances. Researchers are working to determine whether FMO3 polymorphisms can help explain why people respond differently to certain drugs.","Trimethylaminuria More than 25 mutations in the FMO3 gene have been identified in people with trimethylaminuria. Most of these mutations lead to the production of a small, nonfunctional version of the FMO3 enzyme. Other mutations change single building blocks (amino acids) used to build the enzyme, which alters its shape and disrupts its function. Without enough functional FMO3 enzyme, the body is unable to convert trimethylamine into trimethylamine-N-oxide effectively. As a result, trimethylamine builds up in the body and is released in an affected person's sweat, urine, and breath. The excretion of this compound is responsible for the strong body odor characteristic of trimethylaminuria. Studies suggest that diet and stress also play a role in determining the intensity of the fish-like odor. "
509,FMR1 ,fragile X mental retardation 1,"The FMR1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called FMRP. This protein is present in many tissues, including the brain, testes, and ovaries. In the brain, it may play a role in the development of connections between nerve cells (synapses), where cell-to-cell communication occurs. The synapses can change and adapt over time in response to experience (a characteristic called synaptic plasticity). FMRP may help regulate synaptic plasticity, which is important for learning and memory. The protein's role in the testes and ovaries is not well understood.Researchers believe that FMRP acts as a shuttle within cells by transporting molecules called messenger RNA (mRNA), which serve as the genetic blueprint for making proteins. FMRP likely carries mRNA molecules from the nucleus to areas of the cell where proteins are assembled. FMRP also helps control when the instructions in these mRNA molecules are used to build proteins, some of which may be important for functioning of the nerves, testes, or ovaries.One region of the FMR1 gene contains a particular DNA segment known as a CGG trinucleotide repeat, so called because this segment of three DNA building blocks (nucleotides) is repeated multiple times within the gene. In most people, the number of CGG repeats ranges from fewer than 10 to about 40. This CGG repeat segment is typically interrupted several times by a different three-base sequence, AGG. Having AGG scattered among the CGG triplets appears to help stabilize the long repeated segment.","Fragile X syndrome Almost all cases of fragile X syndrome are caused by an expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in the FMR1 gene. In these cases, CGG is abnormally repeated from 200 to more than 1,000 times, which makes this region of the gene unstable. As a result, the FMR1 gene is turned off (silenced) and makes very little or no protein. A loss or shortage of FMRP disrupts normal functions of nerve cells and, consequently, the nervous system, causing severe learning problems, intellectual disability, and the other features of fragile X syndrome. About one-third of males with an FMR1 gene mutation and the characteristic signs of fragile X syndrome also have features of autism spectrum disorders that affect communication and social interaction.Fewer than 1 percent of all cases of fragile X syndrome are caused by other changes in the FMR1 gene. Mutations may delete part or all of the gene or change one of the building blocks (amino acids) used to make FMRP. These genetic changes alter the 3-dimensional shape of the protein or prevent any protein from being produced. The abnormal or missing protein disrupts nervous system functions, leading to the signs and symptoms of fragile X syndrome. "
510,FN1 ,fibronectin 1,"The FN1 gene provides instructions for making two types of the fibronectin-1 protein: soluble plasma fibronectin-1 and insoluble cellular fibronectin-1. Liver cells produce soluble plasma fibronectin-1 and release it into the bloodstream, where it is mainly involved in blood clotting and wound healing. Soluble plasma fibronectin-1 functions outside of cells (in the extracellular spaces), attaching (binding) to the surface of cells and binding to proteins, including other fibronectin-1 proteins. The attachment of these proteins form fibers that assist with tissue repair after an injury. Fibronectin-1 binding also helps with the continual formation of the extracellular matrix, which is an intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that is made in the spaces between cells. This matrix provides structure and strength to tissues that support the body's organs. Many other cell types produce insoluble cellular fibronectin-1, which is released into the extracellular space and contributes to the creation of fibers and extracellular matrix. Both types of fibronectin-1 help individual cells expand (spread) and move (migrate) to cover more space and also influence cell shape and maturation (differentiation).","Fibronectin glomerulopathy At least three mutations in the FN1 gene have been found to cause fibronectin glomerulopathy, a progressive kidney disease that usually begins in adulthood and results in irreversible kidney failure (end-stage renal disease). FN1 gene mutations account for about 40 percent of cases of fibronectin glomerulopathy. The FN1 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the fibronectin-1 protein. One mutation that occurs in multiple families replaces the amino acid tyrosine with the amino acid cysteine at position 973 in the fibronectin-1 protein (written as Tyr973Cys or Y973C). FN1 gene mutations impair the protein's ability to bind to cells and proteins. The unbound fibronectin-1 protein, specifically soluble plasma fibronectin-1, is deposited in the glomeruli of the kidneys. These structures are clusters of tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste products from blood, which are then released in urine. Even though there is an abundance of fibronectin-1 in the glomeruli, the extracellular matrix that supports the blood vessels is weak because the altered fibronectin-1 cannot assist in the matrix's continual formation. Without a strong cellular support network, the glomeruli are less able to filter waste. As a result, products that normally are retained by the body, such as protein and blood, get released in the urine, and acids are not properly filtered from the blood. Over time, the kidneys' ability to filter waste decreases until the kidneys can no longer function, resulting in end-stage renal disease. "
511,FOLR1 ,folate receptor 1,"The FOLR1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called folate receptor alpha. This protein helps regulate transport of the B-vitamin folate into cells. Folate (also called vitamin B9) is needed for many processes, including the production and repair of DNA, regulation of gene activity (expression), and protein production. Folate from food is absorbed in the intestines and then released in a form called 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) into the bloodstream, where it can be taken in by cells in various tissues.Folate receptor alpha is found within the cell membrane, where it attaches (binds) to 5-MTHF, allowing the vitamin to be brought into the cell. Folate receptor alpha is produced in largest amounts in the brain, specifically in an area of the brain called the choroid plexus. This region releases cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord. Folate receptor alpha is thought to play a major role in transporting folate from the bloodstream into brain cells. It transports folate across the choroid plexus and into the CSF, ultimately reaching the brain. In the brain, folate is needed for making chemical messengers called neurotransmitters and a fatty substance called myelin, which insulates nerve fibers and promotes the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. Both of these substances play essential roles in transmitting signals in the nervous system.","Cerebral folate transport deficiency At least 11 mutations in the FOLR1 gene have been found to cause cerebral folate transport deficiency, a disorder characterized by neurological problems that begin around age 2. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in folate receptor alpha. FOLR1 gene mutations result in a lack of protein or malfunctioning protein. Without folate receptor alpha in brain cells, 5-MTHF in the bloodstream cannot be transported into the CSF and passed to the brain. A shortage (deficiency) of folate in the brain impairs normal cell functions such as the production of DNA, proteins, and neurotransmitters. Folate deficiency affects the stability of myelin, leading to impaired production or increased breakdown of this tissue, a condition known as leukodystrophy. These brain abnormalities caused by a lack of folate lead to the intellectual disability, movement problems, and recurrent seizures (epilepsy) typical of cerebral folate transport deficiency. "
512,FOXC1 ,forkhead box C1,"The FOXC1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and regulates the activity of other genes. On the basis of this action, the FOXC1 protein is called a transcription factor.The FOXC1 protein plays a critical role in early development, particularly in the formation of structures in the front part of the eye (the anterior segment). These structures include the colored part of the eye (the iris), the lens of the eye, and the clear front covering of the eye (the cornea). Studies suggest that the FOXC1 protein may also have functions in the adult eye, such as helping cells respond to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress occurs when unstable molecules called free radicals accumulate to levels that can damage or kill cells.The FOXC1 protein is also involved in the normal development of other parts of the body, including the heart, kidneys, and brain.","Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome More than 50 mutations in the FOXC1 gene have been found to cause Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome type 3, a condition that primarily affects the development of the anterior segment of the eye but can also affect other parts of the body. Many FOXC1 gene mutations reduce the amount of functional FOXC1 protein that is produced or result in a defective protein that cannot regulate the activity of other genes. Other genetic changes (such as a duplication of the FOXC1 gene) likely increase the amount or function of the FOXC1 protein. Having either too little or too much activity of this protein disrupts the regulation of other genes needed for normal development.Changes in the amount or function of the FOXC1 protein impairs the development of the anterior segment of the eye, leading to the eye abnormalities characteristic of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome. In some cases, changes involving the FOXC1 protein also cause problems with development of other parts of the body. "
513,FOXC2 ,forkhead box C2,"The FOXC2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the formation of many organs and tissues before birth. This protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of many other genes. Researchers believe that the FOXC2 protein has a role in a variety of developmental processes, such as the formation of veins and the development of the lungs, eyes, kidneys and urinary tract, cardiovascular system, and the transport system for immune cells (lymphatic vessels).","Lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome More than 50 mutations in the FOXC2 gene can cause lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome. Most of these mutations insert or delete a few DNA building blocks (nucleotides), which results in a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the FOXC2 protein. These mutations lead to the production of a FOXC2 protein that is abnormally small and cannot effectively attach (bind) to DNA. As a result, the altered protein cannot regulate the activity of other genes. Other mutations change one protein building block (amino acid) in the area of the FOXC2 protein that binds to DNA, preventing the protein from regulating gene activity. It is not clear why mutations in the FOXC2 gene affect the development of the eye area and lymphatic vessels, the primary regions of the body affected by lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome. "
514,FOXF1 ,forkhead box F1,"The FOXF1 gene provides instructions for making the forkhead box F1 (FOXF1) protein. This protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of many other genes. The FOXF1 protein is important in the development of pulmonary mesenchyme, the embryonic tissue from which blood vessels of the lung arise. It is also involved in the development of the gastrointestinal tract.","Alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins At least four mutations in the FOXF1 gene have been identified in infants with alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACD/MPV). Some mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make the FOXF1 protein. Other mutations insert or delete genetic material in the FOXF1 gene. These mutations result in an inactive protein that cannot regulate development, leading to abnormal formation of the pulmonary blood vessels. Affected infants with FOXF1 gene mutations usually also have gastrointestinal abnormalities. "
515,FOXG1 ,forkhead box G1,"The FOXG1 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as forkhead box G1. This protein is a transcription factor, which means it helps regulate the activity of other genes. Specifically, the forkhead box G1 protein acts as a transcriptional repressor, turning off (repressing) the activity of certain genes when they are not needed. Researchers believe that this protein plays an important role in brain development, particularly in a region of the embryonic brain known as the telencephalon. The telencephalon ultimately develops into several critical structures, including the the largest part of the brain (the cerebrum), which controls most voluntary activity, language, sensory perception, learning, and memory.","FOXG1 syndrome Changes involving the FOXG1 gene cause FOXG1 syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by impaired development and structural brain abnormalities. This condition was previously described as a congenital variant of Rett syndrome, which is a similar disorder of early development. However, doctors and researchers have identified some important differences between the two conditions, so now FOXG1 syndrome is usually considered to be distinct from Rett syndrome.At least 11 mutations within the FOXG1 gene have been identified in people with FOXG1 syndrome. The condition can also result from a deletion of genetic material from a region of the long (q) arm of chromosome 14 that includes the FOXG1 gene and several neighboring genes. All of these genetic changes prevent the production of forkhead box G1 or impair the protein's function. A shortage of this protein disrupts normal brain development starting before birth, which appears to underlie the brain malformations and severe developmental problems characteristic of FOXG1 syndrome. "
516,FOXL2 ,forkhead box L2,"The FOXL2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. On the basis of this role, the FOXL2 protein is called a transcription factor. The protein contains one area where a protein building block (amino acid) called alanine is repeated multiple times. This stretch of alanines is known as a polyalanine tract or poly(A) tract. The function of this poly(A) tract is unknown.The FOXL2 protein is active in multiple tissues, including the eyelids, the ovaries, and a hormone-producing gland at the base of the brain called the pituitary. It is likely involved in the development of muscles in the eyelids. Before birth and in adulthood, the FOXL2 protein regulates the growth and division (proliferation) of hormone-producing ovarian cells called granulosa cells. This protein is also involved in the breakdown of fats, steroid hormones, and potentially harmful molecules called reactive oxygen species in the ovaries. The FOXL2 protein also plays a role in controlled cell death (apoptosis) in the ovaries.","Blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome More than 260 mutations in the FOXL2 gene have been found to cause blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). There are two types of BPES; both types I and II involve abnormalities of the eyelids that prevent them from fully opening. Type I also includes an early loss of ovarian function (primary ovarian insufficiency) in women, which can lead to difficulty conceiving a child.It is difficult to predict the type of BPES that will result from the many FOXL2 gene mutations. However, mutations that result in a partial loss of FOXL2 protein function generally cause BPES type II. These mutations probably impair regulation of the normal development of muscles in the eyelids, resulting in malformed eyelids that cannot open fully. A common mutation in people with BPES type II adds extra alanines to the poly(A) tract in the FOXL2 protein.Mutations that lead to a complete loss of FOXL2 protein function often cause BPES type I. These mutations impair both the regulation of normal eyelid development and various activities in the ovaries. These changes result in eyelid malformations and abnormally accelerated maturation of granulosa cells in the ovaries and the premature death of egg cells.Five percent of mutations that cause BPES occur outside the FOXL2 gene in a neighboring region of DNA that normally controls the activity of the gene, known as a regulatory region. Approximately 12 percent of mutations causing BPES are deletions involving the FOXL2 gene. The deletions vary in size from a single DNA building block (base pair) to the entire gene. Some people with BPES have large DNA deletions that remove not only the FOXL2 gene but one or more neighboring genes. Individuals with these large DNA deletions have the signs and symptoms of BPES, but they can also have other features. The combination of additional features depends on which genes are included in the deletion, but can include an unusually small head (microcephaly), intellectual disability, heart defects, and growth delay. "
517,FOXN1 ,forkhead box N1,"The FOXN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and regulates the activity of other genes. On the basis of this action, the FOXN1 protein is called a transcription factor.The FOXN1 protein is important for development of the skin, hair, nails, and immune system. Studies suggest that this protein helps guide the formation of hair follicles and the growth of fingernails and toenails. The FOXN1 protein also plays a critical role in the formation of the thymus, which is a gland located behind the breastbone where immune system cells called T cells mature and become functional. T cells recognize and attack foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, to help prevent infection.Researchers suspect that the FOXN1 protein is also involved in the development of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), although its role is unclear.","T-cell immunodeficiency, congenital alopecia, and nail dystrophy At least one mutation in the FOXN1 gene has been found to cause T-cell immunodeficiency, congenital alopecia, and nail dystrophy, a condition that affects the immune system and growth of the hair and nails. The known mutation, which is written as Arg255Ter or R255X, replaces the protein building block (amino acid) arginine with a signal to stop protein production. No functional FOXN1 protein is produced from the mutated gene.A lack of FOXN1 protein prevents the formation of the thymus. When this gland is not present, the immune system cannot produce mature, functional T cells to fight infections. As a result, people with T-cell immunodeficiency, congenital alopecia, and nail dystrophy develop recurrent serious infections starting early in life. Loss of the FOXN1 protein also prevents the formation of hair follicles, leading to an absence of hair (alopecia). In addition, a shortage of this protein causes malformations of the fingernails and toenails (nail dystrophy).Researchers have described abnormalities of the central nervous system in at least two cases of T-cell immunodeficiency, congenital alopecia, and nail dystrophy. However, it is not yet known whether central nervous system abnormalities are a common feature of this condition. It is unclear how a shortage of the FOXN1 protein might contribute to these abnormalities. "
518,FOXP2 ,forkhead box P2,"The FOXP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called forkhead box P2. This protein is a transcription factor, which means that it controls the activity of other genes. It attaches (binds) to the DNA of these genes through a region known as a forkhead domain. Researchers suspect that the forkhead box P2 protein may regulate hundreds of genes, although only some of its targets have been identified.The forkhead box P2 protein is active in several tissues, including the brain, both before and after birth. Studies suggest that it plays important roles in brain development, including the growth of nerve cells (neurons) and the transmission of signals between them. It is also involved in synaptic plasticity, which is the ability of connections between neurons (synapses) to change and adapt to experience over time. Synaptic plasticity is necessary for learning and memory.The forkhead box P2 protein appears to be essential for the normal development of speech and language. Researchers are working to identify the genes regulated by forkhead box P2 that are critical for learning these skills.","FOXP2-related speech and language disorder Several changes involving the FOXP2 gene can result in FOXP2-related speech and language disorder, a condition that affects the development of speech and language starting in early childhood. Some affected individuals have a deletion that removes a small segment of chromosome 7, including the FOXP2 gene and several neighboring genes. Other people with this condition have a mutation within the FOXP2 gene itself. Less commonly, FOXP2-related speech and language disorder results from a rearrangement of the structure of chromosome 7 (such as a translocation) or from inheriting two copies of chromosome 7 from the mother instead of one from each parent (a phenomenon called maternal uniparental disomy or maternal UPD). It remains unclear how having two maternal copies of chromosome 7 affects the activity of the FOXP2 gene.The genetic changes that underlie FOXP2-related speech and language disorder disrupt the activity of the FOXP2 gene. Because forkhead box P2 is a transcription factor, these changes affect the activity of other genes in the developing brain. Researchers are working to determine which of these genes are involved and how changes in their activity lead to abnormal speech and language development. "
519,FOXP3 ,forkhead box P3,"The FOXP3 gene provides instructions for producing the forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) protein. The FOXP3 protein attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of genes that are involved in regulating the immune system. The immune system normally protects the body from foreign invaders, such as bacteria and viruses, by recognizing and attacking these invaders and clearing them from the body.On the basis of its role in controlling gene activity, the FOXP3 protein is called a transcription factor. This protein is essential for the production and normal function of certain immune cells called regulatory T cells, which play an important role in preventing autoimmunity. Autoimmunity occurs when the body attacks its own tissues and organs by mistake. The FOXP3 protein is found primarily in an immune system gland called the thymus, where these regulatory T cells are produced.","Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome More than 60 mutations in the FOXP3 gene have been found to cause immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome. This rare condition is characterized by the development of multiple autoimmune disorders in affected individuals, typically affecting the intestines, skin, and hormone-producing (endocrine) glands. Most of the FOXP3 gene mutations involved in IPEX syndrome change a protein building block (amino acid) in the region of the FOXP3 protein that binds to DNA or lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein. Mutations in the FOXP3 gene impair the normal function of regulatory T cells. Without the function of these cells, the body cannot control immune responses. Normal body tissues and organs are attacked, causing the multiple autoimmune disorders that develop in people with IPEX syndrome. "
520,FRAS1 ,Fraser extracellular matrix complex subunit 1,"The FRAS1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of a group of proteins called the FRAS/FREM complex. This complex is found in basement membranes, which are thin, sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues. The FRAS/FREM complex is particularly important during development before birth. One of its roles is to anchor the top layer of skin by connecting the basement membrane of the top layer to the layer of skin below. The FRAS/FREM complex is also involved in the proper development of certain other organs and tissues, including the kidneys, although the mechanism is unclear.","Fraser syndrome At least 24 mutations in the FRAS1 gene cause a condition called Fraser syndrome; FRAS1 gene mutations account for about half of cases of this condition. Fraser syndrome affects development before birth and is characterized by eyes that are completely covered by skin (cryptophthalmos), fusion of the skin between the fingers and toes (cutaneous syndactyly), and abnormalities of the kidneys and other organs and tissues.Most mutations in the FRAS1 gene involved in Fraser syndrome lead to production of an abnormal protein with little or no function. The abnormal protein is likely broken down quickly, preventing formation of the FRAS/FREM complex. Lack of the FRAS/FREM complex in the basement membrane of the skin leads to detachment of the top layer, causing blisters to form during development. These blisters likely prevent the proper formation of certain structures before birth, leading to cryptophthalmos and cutaneous syndactyly. It is unknown how lack of the FRAS/FREM complex leads to kidney abnormalities and other problems in Fraser syndrome. "
521,FREM1 ,FRAS1 related extracellular matrix 1,"The FREM1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the formation and organization of basement membranes, which are thin, sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues.The FREM1 protein is one of a group of proteins, including proteins called FRAS1 and FREM2, that interact during embryonic development as components of basement membranes. Basement membranes help anchor layers of cells lining the surfaces and cavities of the body (epithelial cells) to other embryonic tissues, including those that give rise to connective tissues (such as skin and cartilage) and the kidneys.","Manitoba oculotrichoanal syndrome At least two FREM1 gene mutations have been identified in people with Manitoba oculotrichoanal syndrome. This condition involves several characteristic physical features, particularly affecting the eyes (oculo-), hair (tricho-), and anus (-anal). The mutations delete genetic material from the FREM1 gene or result in a premature stop signal that leads to an abnormally short FREM1 protein, and are believed to result in a nonfunctional protein.Absence of functional FREM1 protein interferes with its role in embryonic basement membrane development and may also affect the location, stability, or function of the FRAS1 and FREM2 proteins. The features of Manitoba oculotrichoanal syndrome may result from the failure of neighboring embryonic tissues to fuse properly due to impairment of the basement membranes' anchoring function. "
522,FREM2 ,FRAS1 related extracellular matrix protein 2,"The FREM2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of a group of proteins called the FRAS/FREM complex; in addition to being part of the complex, FREM2 regulates the complex's formation. The FRAS/FREM complex is found in basement membranes, which are thin, sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues. The complex is particularly important during development before birth. One of its roles is to anchor the top layer of skin by connecting the basement membrane of the top layer to the layer of skin below. The FRAS/FREM complex is also involved in the proper development of certain other organs and tissues, including the kidneys, although the mechanism is unclear.","Fraser syndrome At least two mutations in the FREM2 gene have been found to cause Fraser syndrome; these mutations are involved in a small percentage of cases of this condition. Fraser syndrome affects development before birth and is characterized by eyes that are completely covered by skin (cryptophthalmos), fusion of the skin between the fingers and toes (cutaneous syndactyly), and abnormalities of the kidneys and other organs and tissues.FREM2 gene mutations involved in Fraser syndrome lead to production of an abnormal FREM2 protein that likely does not function properly. As a result, the FRAS/FREM complex cannot form. Lack of the FRAS/FREM complex in the basement membrane of skin leads to detachment of the top layer of skin, causing blisters to form during development. These blisters likely prevent the proper formation of certain structures before birth, leading to cryptophthalmos and cutaneous syndactyly. It is unknown how lack of the FRAS/FREM complex leads to kidney abnormalities and other problems in Fraser syndrome. "
523,FRMD7 ,FERM domain containing 7,"The FRMD7 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose exact function is unknown. This protein is found in many tissues, but it is most abundant in areas of the brain that control eye movement (such as the midbrain and cerebellum) and in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). The FRMD7 protein likely plays a role in the development of nerve cells in these areas of the brain and the retina.",X-linked infantile nystagmus More than 35 mutations in the FRMD7 gene have been found to cause X-linked infantile nystagmus. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the FRMD7 protein. Mutations in the FRMD7 gene likely lead to the production of a protein that is unstable and that cannot perform its normal function. A lack of functional FRMD7 protein is thought to disrupt the development of nerve cells in the retina and areas of the brain that control eye movement. Abnormal development of these nerve cells likely causes the involuntary side-to-side eye movements that are characteristic of X-linked infantile nystagmus. 
524,FTCD ,formimidoyltransferase cyclodeaminase,"The FTCD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase. This enzyme is found mainly in the liver, with smaller amounts in the kidneys. In males it is also found in the testes.Formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase is called a bifunctional enzyme because it performs two functions. Specifically, it is involved in the last two steps in the breakdown (metabolism) of the amino acid histidine, a building block of most proteins. It also plays a role in producing one of several forms of the vitamin folate, which has many important functions in the body.One of the enzyme's functions, called formiminotransferase, breaks down a molecule called N-formiminoglutamate in the process of histidine metabolism. Part of the N-formiminoglutamate molecule, called the formimino group, is incorporated into another molecule called formiminotetrahydrofolate. The amino acid glutamate is also produced in this reaction.The second function of the enzyme, called cyclodeaminase, breaks down formiminotetrahydrofolate to a molecule called 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate and ammonia. 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate is one of several tetrahydrofolate molecules involved in the production (synthesis) of many important molecules in the body, such as purines and pyrimidines (the building blocks of DNA and its chemical cousin, RNA) and amino acids. The tetrahydrofolates carry small molecules called one-carbon units that are needed for the synthesis of these larger molecules.","Glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency At least three FTCD gene mutations that cause glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency have been identified. Two of these mutations change an amino acid in the formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase enzyme sequence. These mutations reduce one of the enzyme's two activities, formiminotransferase. Another mutation results in the production of a formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase enzyme that is shortened so that the part of the enzyme that takes part in the cyclodeaminase reaction is missing. Disruption of these reactions results in the excretion of a molecule called formiminoglutamate (FIGLU) in the urine of affected individuals and, in some severe cases of glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency, a buildup of certain B vitamins called folates in the blood. It is unclear how the mutations result in the specific health problems associated with glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency. "
525,FTL ,ferritin light chain,"The FTL gene provides instructions for making the ferritin light chain, which is one part (subunit) of a protein called ferritin. Ferritin is made up of 24 subunits formed into a hollow spherical molecule. The 24 subunits consist of varying numbers of the ferritin light chain and another subunit called the ferritin heavy chain, which is produced from another gene. The proportion of the two subunits varies in different tissues.Ferritin stores and releases iron in cells. Each ferritin molecule can hold as many as 4,500 iron atoms inside its spherical structure. This storage capacity allows ferritin to regulate the amount of iron in cells and tissues. Iron is needed for the body to produce red blood cells.","Hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome At least 31 mutations in the FTL gene have been identified in people with hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome. Individuals affected by this disorder have an excess of ferritin in the blood (hyperferritinemia) and tissues of the body. A buildup of this protein begins early in life, leading to clouding of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts) in infancy.The mutations that cause hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome are found in a segment of the gene called the iron responsive element (IRE). The IRE normally can attach (bind) to a protein called the iron regulatory protein (IRP). When this binding occurs, the activity (expression) of the FTL gene is stopped to prevent too much ferritin light chain from being produced. This normally occurs when iron levels are low, because under those circumstances less ferritin is needed to store the iron. Mutations in the IRE segment of the FTL gene prevent it from binding with IRP, interfering with the mechanism by which ferritin production is matched to iron levels and resulting in excess ferritin being formed. "
526,FUCA1 ,alpha-L-fucosidase 1,"The FUCA1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called alpha-L-fucosidase. This enzyme is found in lysosomes, which are compartments in the cell that digest and recycle materials. Within lysosomes, this enzyme plays a role in the breakdown of complexes of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) attached to certain proteins (glycoproteins) and fats (glycolipids). Alpha-L-fucosidase is responsible for cutting (cleaving) off a sugar molecule called fucose toward the end of the breakdown process.","Fucosidosis At least 26 mutations in the FUCA1 gene have been found to cause fucosidosis. Most of these mutations result in an abnormally short, nonfunctional alpha-L-fucosidase enzyme. Without this enzyme, glycolipids and glycoproteins cannot be completely broken down. These partially broken down compounds accumulate in the lysosomes and cause cells throughout the body to malfunction. Brain cells are particularly sensitive to the buildup of glycolipids and glycoproteins, which can result in cell death. Loss of brain cells is thought to cause the neurological symptoms of fucosidosis. Accumulation of glycolipids and glycoproteins also occurs in other organs such as the liver, spleen, skin, heart, pancreas, and kidneys, contributing to the additional symptoms of fucosidosis. "
527,FUS ,FUS RNA binding protein,"The FUS gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found within the cell nucleus in most tissues and is involved in many of the steps of protein production.The FUS protein attaches (binds) to DNA and regulates an activity called transcription, which is the first step in the production of proteins from genes. The FUS protein is also involved in processing molecules called messenger RNA (mRNA), which serve as the genetic blueprints for making proteins. By cutting and rearranging mRNA molecules in different ways, the FUS protein controls the production of different versions of certain proteins. This process is known as alternative splicing. Once the FUS protein processes the mRNA, it transports the mRNA out of the nucleus where it gets taken up by other cell structures to be further processed into a mature protein. The FUS protein also helps repair errors in DNA, which prevents cells from accumulating genetic damage.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis At least 85 mutations in the FUS gene have been found to cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a condition characterized by progressive muscle weakness, a loss of muscle mass, and an inability to control movement. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks in the FUS protein and often affect the region of the protein involved in DNA binding and mRNA processing. These mutations may interfere with the transport of mRNA out of the nucleus of cells. As a result, FUS protein and mRNA are trapped within cells and likely form clumps (aggregates), which have been found in nerve cells that control muscle movement (motor neurons) in some people with ALS. It is unclear if protein aggregates cause the nerve cell death that leads to ALS. People with ALS caused by mutations in the FUS gene tend to develop the disease at a younger age and have a decreased life expectancy compared with individuals who have sporadic ALS or ALS caused by mutations in other genes.Rarely, people with ALS caused by FUS gene mutations also develop a condition called frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which is a progressive brain disorder that affects personality, behavior, and language. It is unclear why some people with FUS gene mutations develop FTD and others do not. Individuals who develop both conditions are diagnosed as having ALS-FTD. "
528,FXN ,frataxin,"The FXN gene provides instructions for making a protein called frataxin. This protein is found in cells throughout the body, with the highest levels in the heart, spinal cord, liver, pancreas, and muscles used for voluntary movement (skeletal muscles). Within cells, frataxin is found in energy-producing structures called mitochondria. Although its function is not fully understood, frataxin appears to help assemble clusters of iron and sulfur molecules that are critical for the function of many proteins, including those needed for energy production.One region of the FXN gene contains a segment of DNA known as a GAA trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (one guanine and two adenines) that appear multiple times in a row. In most people, the number of GAA repeats in the FXN gene is fewer than 12 (referred to as short normal). Sometimes, however, the GAA segment is repeated 12 to 33 times (referred to as long normal).","Friedreich ataxia Friedreich ataxia results from an increased number of copies (expansion) of the GAA trinucleotide repeat in the FXN gene. In people with this condition, the GAA segment is abnormally repeated 66 to more than 1,000 times. The length of the GAA trinucleotide repeat appears to be related to the age at which the symptoms of Friedreich ataxia appear. People with GAA segments repeated fewer than 300 times tend to have a later appearance of symptoms (after age 25) than those with larger GAA trinucleotide repeats.Most individuals with Friedreich ataxia have the expanded GAA trinucleotide repeat in both copies of the FXN gene. About 2 percent of people with this condition have an expanded GAA trinucleotide repeat in one copy of the FXN gene and a different kind of mutation in the other copy of the gene. In most of these cases, the other mutation changes a single DNA building block (nucleotide) within the FXN gene.It is not fully understood how FXN gene mutations cause Friedreich ataxia. Mutations in this gene disrupt production of frataxin, greatly reducing the amount of this protein in cells. A shortage of frataxin appears to decrease the activity of proteins that contain iron-sulfur clusters, which could impair the production of energy in mitochondria. Cells with insufficient amounts of frataxin are also particularly sensitive to reactive molecules (free radicals) that can damage and destroy cells. Cells in the brain, spinal cord, and muscles that are damaged or have inadequate energy supplies may not function properly, leading to the signs and symptoms of Friedreich ataxia. "
529,FZD2 ,frizzled class receptor 2,"The FZD2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in development before birth. The FZD2 protein interacts with other proteins (including those produced from the DVL genes, DVL1, DVL2, and DVL3) in chemical signaling pathways called Wnt signaling. These pathways control the activity of genes needed at specific times during development, and they regulate the interactions between cells when organs and tissues are forming. As a key part of Wnt signaling, the FZD2 protein is thought to be important for the normal development of the skeleton and potentially other parts of the body.","Robinow syndrome At least four mutations in the FZD2 gene have been found to cause autosomal dominant Robinow syndrome, a condition that affects the development of many parts of the body, particularly the skeleton. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. FZD2 gene mutations cause a form of the condition that can have a wide variety of features. These include short stature, a particular pattern of facial characteristics, shortening of the long bones in the arms and legs, and short fingers and toes (brachydactyly). This combination of features has been described as autosomal omodysplasia, but researchers now believe that it actually represents a subtype of autosomal dominant Robinow syndrome.Three of the known mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) at position 434 in the FZD2 protein. Another mutation leads to the production of an abnormally short version of the FZD2 protein. These mutations are thought to alter or remove a region of the protein that is needed for its interaction with DVL proteins, which impairs Wnt signaling. Problems with Wnt signaling pathways disrupt the development of many organs and tissues before birth, leading to Robinow syndrome. "
530,FZD4 ,frizzled class receptor 4,"The FZD4 gene provides instructions for making a protein called frizzled-4. This protein is embedded in the outer membrane of many types of cells, where it is involved in transmitting chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. Specifically, frizzled-4 participates in the Wnt signaling pathway, a series of steps that affect the way cells and tissues develop. Wnt signaling is important for cell division (proliferation), attachment of cells to one another (adhesion), cell movement (migration), and many other cellular activities.Studies suggest that, at the cell surface, the frizzled-4 protein interacts with a protein called norrin (produced from the NDP gene). The two proteins fit together like a key in a lock. Researchers suspect that when norrin attaches (binds) to frizzled-4, it initiates a multi-step process that regulates the activity of certain genes. During early development, signaling by norrin and frizzled-4 plays a critical role in the specialization of cells in the retina, which is the light-sensing tissue at the back of the eye. This signaling pathway is also involved in the establishment of a blood supply to the retina and the inner ear.","Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy More than 20 mutations in the FZD4 gene have been identified in people with an eye disorder called familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. Some of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in frizzled-4, while others insert or delete genetic material in the FZD4 gene. Most FZD4 mutations reduce the amount of frizzled-4 that is produced within cells. Other mutations are thought to result in the production of an unstable protein that cannot bind to norrin.A reduction in the amount of frizzled-4 disrupts chemical signaling in the developing eye, which interferes with the formation of blood vessels at the edges of the retina. The resulting abnormal blood supply to this tissue leads to retinal damage and vision loss in some people with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. "
531,FZD6 ,frizzled class receptor 6,"The FZD6 gene provides instructions for making a protein called frizzled-6. This protein is embedded in the outer membrane of cells, where it is involved in transmitting chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus.Specifically, frizzled-6 participates in the Wnt signaling pathway, a series of steps that affect the way cells and tissues develop. Wnt signaling is important for cell division (proliferation), attachment of cells to one another (adhesion), cell movement (migration), and many other cellular activities. At the cell surface, frizzled-6 attaches (binds) to certain proteins, which triggers the frizzled-6 protein to send signals into the cell and initiate the Wnt signaling pathway.Frizzled-6 is active in many tissues. During early development it plays a critical role in the growth and development of nails, particularly the attachment of the nail to the nail bed. Studies suggest that frizzled-6 is also involved in hair growth.","Nonsyndromic congenital nail disorder 10 At least three mutations in the FZD6 gene have been found to cause nonsyndromic congenital nail disorder 10. This condition is characterized by abnormally thick fingernails and toenails that may appear claw-like. The mutations lead to the production of a frizzled-6 protein that cannot get to the cell membrane where it is needed or that cannot transmit signals into the cell. As a result, Wnt signaling is disrupted and the growth and development of nails is poorly regulated, which leads to separation of the nail from the underlying nail bed (onycholysis) and other abnormalities of the fingernails and toenails. "
532,G6PC ,glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit,"The G6PC gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called glucose 6-phosphatase. This enzyme is found on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, which is a structure inside cells that is involved in protein processing and transport. Glucose 6-phosphatase works together with the glucose 6-phosphate translocase protein (produced from the SLC37A4 gene) to break down a type of sugar molecule called glucose 6-phosphate. The breakdown of this molecule produces the simple sugar glucose, which is the primary source of energy for most cells in the body. The glucose 6-phosphatase enzyme is expressed (active) in the liver, kidneys, and intestines, and is the main regulator of glucose production in the liver.","Glycogen storage disease type I At least 85 mutations in the G6PC gene have been found to cause glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSDIa). Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the glucose 6-phosphatase enzyme. Some specific mutations are seen more frequently in certain ethnic or racial groups. Mutations in the G6PC gene impair the function of the glucose 6-phosphatase enzyme. When this enzyme is not functioning normally, glucose 6-phosphate is not broken down and glucose is not produced. Glucose 6-phosphate that is not broken down to glucose is converted to fat and glycogen, a complex sugar that is stored within cells. Too much fat and glycogen stored within a cell can be toxic. This buildup damages organs and tissues throughout the body, particularly the liver and kidneys, leading to the signs and symptoms of GSDIa. "
533,G6PD ,glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase,"The G6PD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. This enzyme, which is active in virtually all types of cells, is involved in the normal processing of carbohydrates. It plays a critical role in red blood cells, which carry oxygen from the lungs to tissues throughout the body. This enzyme helps protect red blood cells from damage and premature destruction.Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is responsible for the first step in the pentose phosphate pathway, a series of chemical reactions that convert glucose (a type of sugar found in most carbohydrates) to another sugar, ribose-5-phosphate. Ribose-5-phosphate is an important component of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA and its chemical cousin RNA. This chemical reaction produces a molecule called NADPH, which plays a role in protecting cells from potentially harmful molecules called reactive oxygen species. These molecules are byproducts of normal cellular functions. Reactions involving NADPH produce compounds that prevent reactive oxygen species from building up to toxic levels within cells. The production of NADPH by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is essential in red blood cells, which are particularly susceptible to damage by reactive oxygen species because they lack other NADPH-producing enzymes.","Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency More than 200 mutations that cause glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency have been identified in the G6PD gene. Almost all of these mutations lead to changes in single building blocks (amino acids) in the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme. These changes disrupt the normal structure and function of the enzyme or reduce the amount of the enzyme produced in cells.Without enough functional glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, red blood cells are unable to protect themselves from the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species. The damaged cells are likely to rupture and break down prematurely (undergo hemolysis). Factors such as infections, certain drugs, and ingesting fava beans can increase the levels of reactive oxygen species, causing red blood cells to undergo hemolysis faster than the body can replace them. This loss of red blood cells causes the signs and symptoms of hemolytic anemia, which is a characteristic feature of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. "
534,GAA ,"glucosidase alpha, acid","The GAA gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called acid alpha-glucosidase (also known as acid maltase). This enzyme is active in lysosomes, which are structures that serve as recycling centers within cells. Lysosomes use digestive enzymes to break down complex molecules into simpler ones that can be used by cells. Acid alpha-glucosidase normally breaks down a complex sugar called glycogen into a simpler sugar called glucose. Glucose is the main energy source for most cells.","Pompe disease More than 200 mutations in the GAA gene have been identified in people with Pompe disease. Many of these mutations change one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make acid alpha-glucosidase. Other mutations insert or delete genetic material in the GAA gene. Mutations in this gene significantly reduce the activity of acid alpha-glucosidase, preventing the enzyme from breaking down glycogen effectively. As a result, this complex sugar can build up to toxic levels in lysosomes. The abnormal buildup of glycogen damages organs and tissues throughout the body, particularly the muscles, leading to progressive muscle weakness, heart problems, and the other features of Pompe disease. "
535,GABRA1 ,gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor alpha1 subunit,"The GABRA1 gene provides instructions for making one piece, the alpha-1 (α1) subunit, of the GABAA receptor protein. GABAA receptors are made up of different combinations of five protein subunits, each produced from a different gene. (Nineteen different genes provide instructions for GABAA receptor subunits.) These subunits form a hole (pore) in the cell membrane through which negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions) can flow.A chemical that transmits signals in the brain (a neurotransmitter) called gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) attaches to GABAA receptors. Once GABA attaches, the pore formed by the subunits opens, and chloride ions flow across the cell membrane. After infancy, chloride ions flow into the cell through the open pore, which creates an environment in the cell that blocks (inhibits) signaling between neurons. The primary role of GABA in children and adults is to prevent the brain from being overloaded with too many signals. In contrast, in newborns and infants, chloride ions flow out of the cell when the pore is opened, creating an environment that allows signaling between neurons.","Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy A mutation in the GABRA1 gene has been identified in at least one family with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. This condition typically begins in childhood or adolescence and causes recurrent myoclonic seizures, which are characterized by rapid, uncontrolled muscle jerks. Affected individuals can also have other types of seizures called generalized tonic-clonic seizures (or grand mal seizures) and absence seizures. The mutation associated with this condition changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the α1 subunit. The amino acid alanine at protein position 322 is replaced by the amino acid asparagine. This gene mutation is written as Ala322Asp or A322D.This GABRA1 gene mutation leads to the formation of an abnormal α1 subunit that reduces GABAA receptor function. GABAA receptors containing the abnormal subunit are broken down before they reach the cell membrane. Studies show that the altered receptors can also interfere with normal receptors inside the cell, leading to the additional loss of normal receptors. Because of the reduction of GABAA receptor function, signaling between neurons is not regulated, which can lead to overstimulation of neurons. Researchers believe that the overstimulation of certain neurons in the brain triggers the abnormal brain activity associated with seizures. "
536,GALC ,galactosylceramidase,"The GALC gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called galactosylceramidase. Through a process called hydrolysis, this enzyme uses water molecules to break down certain fats called galactolipids, which are found primarily in the nervous system and kidneys.Within cells, galactosylceramidase is found in enzyme-filled sacs called lysosomes where it hydrolyzes specific galactolipids, including galactosylceramide and psychosine. Galactosylceramide is an important component of myelin, the protective covering around certain nerve cells that ensures the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. Its breakdown by galactosylceramidase is part of the normal turnover of myelin that occurs throughout life. Psychosine, which is toxic to cells, forms during the production of myelin and is quickly broken down by galactosylceramidase. Under normal conditions, tissues contain very little psychosine.","Krabbe disease More than 200 GALC gene mutations that cause Krabbe disease have been identified. Krabbe disease is a brain disorder that usually begins in infancy (infantile Krabbe disease) and causes movement and eating problems, impaired development, and seizures. The most common mutation in affected individuals of European ancestry (often called 30-kb del) deletes a large segment of the GALC gene. Other mutations insert additional DNA building blocks (nucleotides) into the GALC gene, delete a small number of nucleotides from the gene, or replace single nucleotides with incorrect nucleotides.These GALC gene mutations severely reduce or eliminate the activity of the galactosylceramidase enzyme. As a result, galactosylceramide and psychosine cannot be broken down. The accumulation of these galactolipids causes damage to myelin-forming cells, which impairs the formation of myelin and leads to the loss of myelin (demyelination) in the nervous system. Without myelin, nerves in the brain and other parts of the body cannot transmit signals properly, leading to the signs and symptoms of Krabbe disease.Some individuals develop symptoms of Krabbe disease in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood (late-onset Krabbe disease). It is thought that these individuals have a mutation that allows some activity of the galactosylceramidase enzyme, which delays onset of the condition. The severity of the condition may also be affected by the presence of additional common variations (polymorphisms) in the GALC gene that affect the activity of the galactosylceramidase enzyme. "
537,GALE ,UDP-galactose-4-epimerase,"The GALE gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called UDP-galactose-4-epimerase. This enzyme enables the body to process a simple sugar called galactose, which is present in small amounts in many foods. Galactose is primarily part of a larger sugar called lactose, which is found in all dairy products and many baby formulas.UDP-galactose-4-epimerase converts a modified form of galactose (UDP-galactose) to another modified sugar (UDP-glucose). Glucose is a simple sugar that is the main energy source for most cells. This enzyme also promotes the reverse chemical reaction, the conversion of UDP-glucose to UDP-galactose. UDP-galactose is used to build galactose-containing proteins and fats, which play critical roles in chemical signaling, building cellular structures, transporting molecules, and producing energy.","Galactosemia More than 20 mutations in the GALE gene have been identified in people with a form of galactosemia known as type III or galactose epimerase deficiency. The signs and symptoms of this condition begin shortly after birth and can vary from mild to severe. Most of the genetic changes alter a single protein building block (amino acid) in UDP-galactose-4-epimerase, which makes the enzyme unstable or impairs its usual function.Some GALE gene mutations severely reduce or eliminate the activity of UDP-galactose-4-epimerase in all of the body's tissues. These genetic changes lead to a severe form of galactosemia type III described as the generalized form. A loss of enzyme activity prevents cells from processing galactose obtained from the diet. As a result, compounds associated with galactose processing can build up to toxic levels in the body. The accumulation of these substances damages tissues and organs, leading to serious complications such as clouding of the lens of the eye (cataract), intellectual disability, and damage to the liver, kidneys, and brain.Other mutations in the GALE gene reduce the activity of UDP-galactose-4-epimerase in red blood cells only. These genetic changes underlie a much milder form of galactosemia type III described as the peripheral form. Affected individuals may not have any of the complications typically associated with galactosemia and often do not require treatment. Researchers are unclear why the effects of some GALE mutations are restricted to blood cells, while other mutations affect all of the body's tissues and cause severe health problems. "
538,GALK1 ,galactokinase 1,"The GALK1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called galactokinase 1. This enzyme enables the body to process a simple sugar called galactose, which is present in small amounts in many foods. Galactose is primarily part of a larger sugar called lactose, which is found in all dairy products and many baby formulas.Galactokinase 1 is responsible for one step in a chemical process that converts galactose into other molecules that can be used by the body. Specifically, this enzyme modifies galactose to create a similar molecule called galactose-1-phosphate. A series of additional steps converts galactose-1-phosphate to another simple sugar called glucose, which is the main energy source for most cells. Galactose-1-phosphate can also be converted to a form that is used to build galactose-containing proteins and fats. These modified proteins and fats play critical roles in chemical signaling, building cellular structures, transporting molecules, and producing energy.","Galactosemia More than 30 mutations in the GALK1 gene have been identified in people with a form of galactosemia called type II or galactokinase deficiency. Affected infants develop clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts) but otherwise experience few of the long-term complications associated with classic galactosemia. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in galactokinase 1. A few mutations delete a small amount of genetic material from the GALK1 gene, resulting in an unstable or inactive version of this enzyme.A shortage of functional galactokinase 1 prevents cells from processing galactose obtained from the diet. As a result, galactose and a related sugar called galactitol can build up, particularly in cells that make up the lens of the eye. An accumulation of these substances damages the lens, causing it to become cloudy and leading to blurred vision. "
539,GALNS ,galactosamine (N-acetyl)-6-sulfatase,"The GALNS gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfatase. This enzyme is located in lysosomes, which are compartments within cells that break down and recycle different types of molecules. N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfatase is involved in the breakdown of large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) or mucopolysaccharides. Specifically, this enzyme removes a chemical group known as a sulfate from a GAG called keratan sulfate. Keratan sulfate is particularly abundant in cartilage and the clear covering of the eye (cornea).","Mucopolysaccharidosis type IV More than 148 mutations in the GALNS gene have been found to cause mucopolysaccharidosis type IV (MPS IV). Most of these mutations change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the gene. All of the mutations that cause MPS IV reduce or eliminate the function of N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfatase.The lack of N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfatase activity leads to the accumulation of keratan sulfate within lysosomes. Because keratan sulfate is predominantly found in cartilage and the cornea, the buildup of this substance causes skeletal abnormalities and cloudy corneas. Researchers believe that a buildup of GAGs may also cause the features of MPS IV by interfering with the functions of other proteins inside lysosomes and disrupting the movement of molecules inside the cell. "
540,GALNT3 ,polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3,"The GALNT3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ppGalNacT3, which is found in many types of cells. This protein plays a major role in regulating phosphate levels within the body (phosphate homeostasis). Among its many functions, phosphate plays a critical role in the formation and growth of bones in childhood and helps maintain bone strength in adults. Phosphate levels are controlled in large part by the kidneys. The kidneys normally rid the body of excess phosphate by excreting it in urine, and they reabsorb this mineral into the bloodstream when more is needed.The ppGalNacT3 protein regulates the activity of a protein called fibroblast growth factor 23, which is produced in bone cells and whose function is to signal the body to decrease phosphate reabsorption by the kidneys. The ppGalNacT3 protein attaches sugar molecules to particular regions of fibroblast growth factor 23 through a process called glycosylation. These sugar molecules are required for the protein's transport out of cells and to protect the protein from being broken down. When phosphate levels are increased, ppGalNacT3 glycosylates fibroblast growth factor 23 so it will not be broken down. Signaling from fibroblast growth factor 23 leads to a decrease in phosphate reabsorption, which helps to maintain normal phosphate levels in the body.","Hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis At least 25 mutations in the GALNT3 gene have been found to cause hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis (HFTC), a condition characterized by an increase in the levels of phosphate in the blood (hyperphosphatemia) and abnormal deposits of phosphate and calcium (calcinosis) in the body's tissues. GALNT3 gene mutations result in the production of ppGalNacT3 protein with little or no function. As a result, ppGalNacT3 cannot glycosylate fibroblast growth factor 23. Fibroblast growth factor 23 becomes trapped within the cell and is broken down rather than being released from cells (secreted) as usual. Without fibroblast growth factor 23, more phosphate is reabsorbed back into the bloodstream by the kidneys, leading to hyperphosphatemia. Calcinosis results when the excess phosphate combines with calcium to form deposits that build up in soft tissues. "
541,GALT ,galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase,"The GALT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. This enzyme enables the body to process a simple sugar called galactose, which is present in small amounts in many foods. Galactose is primarily part of a larger sugar called lactose, which is found in all dairy products and many baby formulas.Galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase is responsible for one step in a chemical process that breaks down galactose into other molecules that can be used by the body. Specifically, this enzyme converts a modified form of galactose (galactose-1-phosphate) to glucose, which is another simple sugar. Glucose is the main energy source for most cells. This chemical reaction also produces another form of galactose (UDP-galactose) that is used to build galactose-containing proteins and fats. These modified proteins and fats play critical roles in chemical signaling, building cellular structures, transporting molecules, and producing energy.","Galactosemia More than 300 mutations in the GALT gene have been identified in people with the classic form of galactosemia, a condition that causes life-threatening signs and symptoms beginning shortly after birth. Most of these mutations severely reduce or eliminate the activity of galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. A shortage of this enzyme prevents cells from processing galactose obtained from the diet. As a result, galactose-1-phosphate and related compounds can build up to toxic levels in the body. The accumulation of these substances damages tissues and organs, leading to the serious medical problems associated with classic galactosemia.Most changes in the GALT gene alter single protein building blocks (amino acids) in galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. The most common GALT mutation in white Europeans and North Americans replaces the amino acid glutamine with the amino acid arginine at position 188 in the enzyme (written as Gln188Arg or Q188R). Another mutation occurs almost exclusively in people of African descent. This genetic change substitutes the amino acid leucine for the amino acid serine at position 135 (written as Ser135Leu or S135L).A particular GALT mutation called the Duarte variant results in a form of galactosemia with less serious complications than the classic type. This mutation replaces the amino acid asparagine with the amino acid aspartic acid at protein position 314 (written as Asn314Asp or N314D). The Duarte variant reduces but does not eliminate the activity of galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. The signs and symptoms associated with this variant tend to be milder because the enzyme retains 5 percent to 20 percent of its normal activity. "
542,GAMT ,guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase,"The GAMT gene provides instructions for making the enzyme guanidinoacetate methyltransferase, which is active (expressed) mainly in the liver. This enzyme participates in the two-step production (synthesis) of the compound creatine from the protein building blocks (amino acids) glycine, arginine, and methionine. Specifically, guanidinoacetate methyltransferase controls the second step of this process. In this step, creatine is produced from another compound called guanidinoacetate. Creatine is needed for the body to store and use energy properly. It is involved in providing energy for muscle contraction, and is also important in nervous system functioning.In addition to its role in creatine synthesis, the guanidinoacetate methyltransferase enzyme is thought to help activate a process called fatty acid oxidation. This process provides an energy source for cells during times of stress when their normal fuel, the simple sugar glucose, is scarce.","Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency At least 49 mutations in the GAMT gene cause guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency, a disorder that involves intellectual disability and seizures. Most affected individuals of Portuguese ancestry have a particular mutation in which the amino acid tryptophan is replaced by the amino acid serine at position 20 in the enzyme (written as Trp20Ser or W20S).GAMT gene mutations impair the ability of the guanidinoacetate methyltransferase enzyme to participate in creatine synthesis, resulting in a shortage of creatine. The effects of guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency are most severe in organs and tissues that require large amounts of energy, especially the brain. "
543,GAN ,gigaxonin,"The GAN gene provides instructions for making a protein called gigaxonin. Gigaxonin is part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is a multi-step process that identifies and gets rid of excess or damaged proteins or structures (organelles) within cells. The ubiquitin-proteasome system tags unneeded proteins with a small protein called ubiquitin, marking them for destruction by a complex of enzymes called a proteasome. As part of this process, enzymes called E3 ubiquitin ligases recognize the specific proteins to be broken down and attach ubiquitin to them. Gigaxonin belongs to a group of E3 ubiquitin ligases called the Cul3-E3 ligases. It helps break down protein structures called intermediate filaments, which form networks that provide support and strength to cells.In nerve cells (neurons), gigaxonin is thought to help break down specialized intermediate filaments called neurofilaments. Neurofilaments comprise the structural framework that establishes the size and shape of nerve cell extensions called axons, which are essential for transmission of nerve impulses.","Giant axonal neuropathy At least 47 mutations in the GAN gene have been identified in people with giant axonal neuropathy, an inherited disorder that causes gradually worsening loss of movement and sensation. Giant axonal neuropathy is characterized by abnormally large (giant) and deteriorating axons.GAN gene mutations result in an unstable gigaxonin protein that breaks down easily, resulting in much less gigaxonin in cells than normal. In neurons, the reduction in gigaxonin leads to accumulation of neurofilaments that should have been destroyed by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The neurofilaments become densely packed in the giant axons of people with giant axonal neuropathy. The giant axons are commonly seen in the peripheral nerves, which carry signals between the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) and other areas of the body. However, axons in the central nervous system can be affected as well. These abnormal axons do not transmit signals properly and eventually deteriorate, causing severe problems in the peripheral nerves and the central nervous system. "
544,GARS1 ,glycyl-tRNA synthetase,"The GARS1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called glycyl-tRNA synthetase. This enzyme is found in all cell types and plays an important role in the production (synthesis) of proteins. During protein synthesis, building blocks (amino acids) are connected together in a specific order, creating a chain of amino acids. Glycyl-tRNA synthetase plays a role in adding the amino acid glycine at the proper place in a protein's chain of amino acids.",Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Genetics Home Reference provides information about Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. 
545,GATA1 ,GATA binding protein 1,"The GATA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of many other genes. On the basis of this action, the GATA1 protein is known as a transcription factor. The GATA1 protein is involved in the specialization (differentiation) of immature blood cells. To function properly, these immature cells must differentiate into specific types of mature blood cells. By binding to DNA and interacting with other proteins, the GATA1 protein regulates the growth and division (proliferation) of immature red blood cells and platelet-precursor cells (megakaryocytes) to facilitate their differentiation. Red blood cells help carry oxygen to various tissues throughout the body and platelets aid in blood clotting. The GATA1 protein is also important for the maturation of several types of white blood cells that help fight infection, including eosinophils, mast cells, and dendritic cells.Two versions of the GATA1 protein are produced from the GATA1 gene: a regular length protein and a shorter version called GATA1s. The GATA1s protein lacks a specific region called the transactivation domain. Although the specific function of this region is unclear, researchers believe that it interacts with other proteins to modify GATA1 protein function.","Dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia At least eight different mutations in the GATA1 gene have been found to cause dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Most of these mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the GATA1 protein. GATA1 gene mutations disrupt the protein's ability to bind with DNA or interact with other proteins. This impairment in the GATA1 protein's normal function leads to increased proliferation,decreased differentiation, and premature death of immature blood cells. Immature blood cells cannot perform the functions of specialized, mature blood cells. A lack of differentiation causes a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) and platelets involved in blood clotting (thrombocytopenia), which are characteristic features of dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia. "
546,GATM ,glycine amidinotransferase,"The GATM gene provides instructions for making the enzyme arginine:glycine amidinotransferase. This enzyme participates in the two-step production (synthesis) of the compound creatine from the protein building blocks (amino acids) glycine, arginine, and methionine. Specifically, arginine:glycine amidinotransferase controls the first step of the process. In this step, a compound called guanidinoacetic acid is produced by transferring a cluster of nitrogen and hydrogen atoms called a guanidino group from arginine to glycine. Guanidinoacetic acid is converted to creatine in the second step of the process. Creatine is needed for the body to store and use energy properly.","Arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency At least two mutations in the GATM gene cause arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency, a disorder that involves delayed development, intellectual disability, and in some cases muscle weakness. These mutations result in the production of an abnormally shortened arginine:glycine amidinotransferase enzyme or disrupt how genetic information is pieced together to make a blueprint for producing the enzyme.GATM gene mutations interfere with the ability of the arginine:glycine amidinotransferase enzyme to participate in creatine synthesis, resulting in a shortage of creatine. The effects of arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency are most severe in organs and tissues that require large amounts of energy, especially the brain. "
547,GBA ,glucosylceramidase beta,"The GBA gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called beta-glucocerebrosidase. This enzyme is active in lysosomes, which are structures inside cells that act as recycling centers. Lysosomes use digestive enzymes to break down toxic substances, digest bacteria that invade the cell, and recycle worn-out cell components. Based on these functions, enzymes in the lysosome are sometimes called housekeeping enzymes. Beta-glucocerebrosidase is a housekeeping enzyme that helps break down a large molecule called glucocerebroside into a sugar (glucose) and a simpler fat molecule (ceramide). Glucocerebroside is a component of the membrane that surrounds cells. It gets broken down by beta-glucocerebrosidase when cells die, and the components are reused as new cells are formed.","Gaucher disease More than 380 mutations in the GBA gene have been identified in people with Gaucher disease, a disorder with varied features that affect many parts of the body. Affected individuals can have enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), blood cell abnormalities, and rarely, severe neurological problems. The mutations occur in both copies of the gene in each cell. Most of the GBA gene mutations responsible for Gaucher disease change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in beta-glucocerebrosidase, altering the structure of the enzyme and preventing it from working normally. Other mutations delete or insert genetic material in the GBA gene or lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the enzyme.Mutations in the GBA gene greatly reduce or eliminate the activity of beta-glucocerebrosidase in cells. As a result, glucocerebroside is not broken down properly. This molecule and related substances can build up in white blood cells called macrophages in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and other organs. The abnormal accumulation and storage of these substances damages tissues and organs, causing the characteristic features of Gaucher disease. "
548,GBE1 ,"1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme 1","The GBE1 gene provides instructions for making the glycogen branching enzyme. This enzyme is involved in the last step of the production of a complex sugar called glycogen, which is a major source of stored energy in the body. Glycogen is made up of many molecules of a simple sugar called glucose; some glucose molecules are linked together in a straight line, while others branch off the main line and form side chains. The glycogen branching enzyme is involved in the formation of these side chains. The branched structure of glycogen makes it more compact for storage and allows it to break down more easily when it is needed for fuel.","Adult polyglucosan body disease At least three mutations in the GBE1 gene have been found to cause adult polyglucosan body disease, a condition that affects the nervous system. These mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the glycogen branching enzyme. One mutation appears to be more common in affected people with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. This mutation replaces the amino acid tyrosine with the amino acid serine at position 329 in the enzyme (written Tyr329Ser or Y329S). Most mutations that cause adult polyglucosan body disease lead to a shortage (deficiency) of the enzyme. As a result, glycogen has fewer side chains. These abnormal glycogen molecules, called polyglucosan bodies, accumulate within cells and cause damage. Nerve cells (neurons) appear to be particularly vulnerable to the accumulation of polyglucosan bodies in this disorder. Damage to neurons causes reduced sensation, weakness, and other nervous system problems in people with adult polyglucosan body disease. "
549,GCDH ,glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase,"The GCDH gene provides instructions for making the enzyme glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase. This enzyme is found in mitochondria, the energy-producing centers of cells. The GCDH enzyme is involved in the breakdown of the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan, which are building blocks of proteins.","Glutaric acidemia type I Mutations in the GCDH gene prevent production of the glutaryl-CoA enzyme, or result in the production of a defective enzyme that cannot fulfill its role in the breakdown of lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan. This enzyme deficiency allows these amino acids and their intermediate breakdown products to build up to abnormal levels, which damages the nervous system, especially when the body is under stress.More than 150 GCDH gene mutations that cause glutaric acidemia type I have been reported in populations around the world. Most of these mutations result in the substitution of one amino acid for another amino acid in the enzyme. In the Old Order Amish community, all known glutaric acidemia type I cases derive from the replacement of the amino acid alanine with the amino acid valine at position 421 (written as Ala421Val or A421V). A few specific mutations have been seen in certain Native American populations. Individuals with glutaric acidemia type I who belong to the Lumbee community of North Carolina have been found to have a mutation in which the amino acid glutamic acid is replaced with the amino acid lysine at position 414, written as Glu414Lys or E414K. A mutation that replaces a particular DNA building block (nucleotide) called guanine with the nucleotide thymine (written as IVS1, G-T, +5) is prevalent in the Ojibwa population of Canada. As a result of this mutation, an abnormally shortened version of the enzyme is produced. Many different mutations occur in other populations. "
550,GCH1 ,GTP cyclohydrolase 1,"The GCH1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called GTP cyclohydrolase 1. This enzyme is involved in the first of three steps in the production of a molecule called tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Other enzymes help carry out the second and third steps in this process.Tetrahydrobiopterin plays a critical role in processing several protein building blocks (amino acids) in the body. For example, it works with the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase to convert an amino acid called phenylalanine into another amino acid, tyrosine. Tetrahydrobiopterin is also involved in reactions that produce chemicals called neurotransmitters, which transmit signals between nerve cells in the brain. Specifically, tetrahydrobiopterin is involved in the production of two neurotransmitters called dopamine and serotonin. Among their many functions, dopamine transmits signals within the brain to produce smooth physical movements, and serotonin regulates mood, emotion, sleep, and appetite. Because it helps enzymes carry out chemical reactions, tetrahydrobiopterin is known as a cofactor.","Dopa-responsive dystonia More than 140 mutations in the GCH1 gene have been found to cause dopa-responsive dystonia. This condition is characterized by a pattern of involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia), tremors, and other uncontrolled movements and usually responds to treatment with a medication called L-Dopa. Dopa-responsive dystonia results when one copy of the GCH1 gene is mutated in each cell. Most GCH1 gene mutations that cause this condition change single amino acids in the GTP cyclohydrolase 1 enzyme. Researchers believe that the abnormal enzyme may interfere with the activity of the normal version of GTP cyclohydrolase 1 that is produced from the copy of the gene with no mutation. As a result, the amount of working enzyme in affected individuals is reduced by 80 percent or more. A reduction in functional GTP cyclohydrolase 1 enzyme causes less dopamine and serotonin to be produced, leading to the movement problems and other characteristic features of dopa-responsive dystonia. "
551,GDF3 ,growth differentiation factor 3,"The GDF3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) superfamily, which is a group of proteins that help control the growth and development of tissues throughout the body. Within the TGFβ superfamily, the GDF3 protein belongs to the bone morphogenetic protein family, which is involved in regulating the growth and maturation (differentiation) of bone and cartilage. Cartilage is a tough but flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. The proteins in this family are regulators of cell growth and differentiation both before and after birth. While the GDF3 protein is known to be involved in bone and cartilage development, its exact role is unclear.The GDF3 protein has also been found to be involved in the development of the eyes, specifically the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye called the retina.","Klippel-Feil syndrome At least four mutations in the GDF3 gene have been found to cause Klippel-Feil syndrome, a condition characterized by the abnormal joining (fusion) of two or more spinal bones in the neck (cervical vertebrae) and a variety of other features affecting many parts of the body. GDF3 gene mutations that cause Klippel-Feil syndrome replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the GDF3 protein. These mutations likely lead to a reduction in functional protein. Although the GDF3 protein is involved in bone growth, it is unclear how a shortage of this protein leads to incomplete separation of the cervical vertebrae in people with Klippel-Feil syndrome. "
552,GDF6 ,growth differentiation factor 6,"The GDF6 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) superfamily, which is a group of proteins that help control the growth and development of tissues throughout the body. Within the TGFβ superfamily, the GDF6 protein belongs to the bone morphogenetic protein family, which is involved in regulating the growth and maturation (differentiation) of bone and cartilage. Cartilage is a tough but flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. The proteins in this family are regulators of cell growth and differentiation both before and after birth. The GDF6 protein is necessary for the formation of bones and joints in the limbs, skull, spine, chest, and ribs. The protein is involved in setting up boundaries between bones during skeletal development.The GDF6 protein has also been found to be involved in the development of the eyes, specifically the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye called the retina. The GDF6 protein likely plays a role in the survival of specialized cells within the retina that detect light and color (photoreceptor cells).","Klippel-Feil syndrome At least 10 mutations in the GDF6 gene have been found to cause Klippel-Feil syndrome, a condition characterized by the abnormal joining (fusion) of two or more spinal bones in the neck (cervical vertebrae) and a variety of other features affecting many parts of the body. Most GDF6 gene mutations that cause Klippel-Feil syndrome replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the GDF6 protein. These mutations likely lead to a reduction in functional protein. Although the GDF6 protein is involved in bone growth and the formation of vertebrae, it is unclear how a shortage of this protein leads to incomplete separation of the cervical vertebrae in people with Klippel-Feil syndrome. "
553,GFAP ,glial fibrillary acidic protein,"The GFAP gene provides instructions for making a protein called glial fibrillary acidic protein. This protein is a member of the intermediate filament family of proteins. Intermediate filaments form networks that provide support and strength to cells. Several molecules of glial fibrillary acidic protein bind together to form the type of intermediate filament found in astroglial cells. Astroglial cells support and nourish cells in the brain and spinal cord. If brain or spinal cord cells are injured through trauma or disease, astroglial cells react by rapidly producing more glial fibrillary acidic protein.Although its function is not fully understood, glial fibrillary acidic protein is probably involved in controlling the shape, movement, and function of astroglial cells. Some researchers have suggested that astroglial cells play an important role in the functioning of other cells, including specialized cells that surround nerves (oligodendrocytes) and are involved in the production and long-term maintenance of myelin. Myelin is the fatty substance that forms a protective coating around certain nerve cells and ensures the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. Additionally, astroglial cells may assist in maintaining the protective barrier that allows only certain substances to pass between blood vessels and the brain (the blood-brain barrier).","Alexander disease Researchers have identified more than 50 GFAP mutations that cause Alexander disease. Most of these mutations change one of the building blocks (amino acids) used to make glial fibrillary acidic protein. A few mutations add or remove two amino acids in the protein. All of these changes alter the structure of glial fibrillary acidic protein. The altered protein probably disturbs the formation of normal intermediate filaments. As a result, the abnormal glial fibrillary acidic protein may accumulate in astroglial cells, contributing to the formation of Rosenthal fibers, which impair cell function. It is not well understood how impaired astroglial cells contribute to the abnormal maintenance of myelin, causing the signs and symptoms of Alexander disease. "
554,GFM1 ,G elongation factor mitochondrial 1,"The GFM1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called mitochondrial translation elongation factor G1. This enzyme is found in cell structures called mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers within cells. While instructions for making most of the body's proteins are found in DNA that is stored in the nucleus of cells (nuclear DNA), a few proteins and other molecules are produced from DNA that is stored in mitochondria (mtDNA). Mitochondrial translation elongation factor G1 is involved in the production of proteins from mtDNA through a process called translation. The mtDNA genes provide instructions for products that are involved in protein production and the process of turning energy taken in from food into a form that cells can use (oxidative phosphorylation).During translation, mtRNA molecules, which are the protein blueprints created from mtDNA, interact with specialized complexes called ribosomes to assemble protein building blocks (amino acids) into a fully formed protein. The role of mitochondrial translation elongation factor G1 is to coordinate the movements of mtRNA molecules with ribosomes to allow assembly of the protein to continue until it is complete.","Combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency 1 At least 18 mutations in the GFM1 gene have been found to cause combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency 1. This condition causes severe neurologic and liver dysfunction. Affected individuals usually do not survive past early childhood. Most of the GFM1 gene mutations change single amino acids in the mitochondrial translation elongation factor G1 enzyme. Such alterations reduce or eliminate the enzyme's function. As a result, fewer mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation are produced. Organs that have high energy demands, such as the brain and liver, are particularly affected by the resulting impairment of oxidative phosphorylation. A shortage of energy in these tissues leads to cell death, causing the neurological and liver problems in people with combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency 1. It is thought that other tissues that require a lot of energy, such as the heart and other muscles, are not affected in this condition because they have additional enzymes that can perform the process of mitochondrial protein production. "
555,GH1 ,growth hormone 1,"The GH1 gene provides instructions for making the growth hormone protein. Growth hormone is produced in the growth-stimulating somatotropic cells of the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain. Growth hormone is necessary for the normal growth of the body's bones and tissues. The production of growth hormone is triggered when two other hormones are turned on (activated): ghrelin, which is produced in the stomach; and growth hormone releasing hormone, which is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. Ghrelin and growth hormone releasing hormone also stimulate the release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland. The release of growth hormone into the body peaks during puberty and reaches a low point at about age 55.Cells in the liver respond to growth hormone and trigger the production of a protein called insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). This protein stimulates cell growth and cell maturation (differentiation) in many different tissues, including bone. The production of IGF-I by the actions of growth hormone is a major contributor to the promotion of growth.Growth hormone also plays a role in many chemical reactions (metabolic processes) in the body. By acting on specific tissues, growth hormone is involved in protein production and the breakdown (metabolism) of fats and carbohydrates.","Isolated growth hormone deficiency More than 70 mutations in the GH1 gene have been found to cause isolated growth hormone deficiency, a condition characterized by slow growth and short stature. Mutations that prevent the production of growth hormone, such as a deletion of a large section of the gene, result in isolated growth hormone deficiency type IA and severe growth failure by age 6 months. GH1 gene mutations that cause type IB are found throughout the gene and allow some growth hormone to be produced.Most GH1 gene mutations that cause isolated growth hormone deficiency type II occur in a part of the gene called intron 3. These mutations result in the production of growth hormone that is shorter than normal. This short version of growth hormone is not released from cells and is not available to work in the body. In addition, this shorter growth hormone interferes with the function of normal growth hormone, so there is very little functional growth hormone available for use. A decrease in usable growth hormone results in the signs and symptoms of isolated growth hormone deficiency type II. "
556,GHR ,growth hormone receptor,"The GHR gene provides instructions for making a protein called the growth hormone receptor. This receptor is embedded in the outer membrane of cells throughout the body and is most abundant in liver cells.The growth hormone receptor has three major parts: An extracellular region that sticks out from the surface of the cell, a transmembrane region that anchors the receptor to the cell membrane, and an intracellular region that transmits signals to the interior of the cell. The extracellular region attaches (binds) to a substance called growth hormone, fitting together like a lock and its key. The binding of growth hormone triggers signaling via the intracellular region of the receptor that stimulates the growth and division of cells. This signaling also leads to the production, primarily by liver cells, of another important growth-promoting hormone called insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I).Growth hormone and IGF-I have a wide variety of effects on the growth and function of many parts of the body. For example, these hormones stimulate the growth and division of cells called chondrocytes, which play a critical role in producing new bone tissue. Growth hormone and IGF-I also influence metabolism, including how the body uses and stores carbohydrates, proteins, and fats from food.Researchers have identified two major versions (isoforms) of the growth hormone receptor. The two isoforms differ by the presence or absence of a particular segment known as exon 3, which is located in the extracellular region of the receptor. The version of the receptor that includes exon 3 is known as the full-length isoform (fl-GHR), while the version that is missing exon 3 is known as the exon 3-deficient isoform (d3-GHR). Both isoforms are relatively common in most populations. Each individual can have fl-GHR only, d3-GHR only, or a mix of both isoforms. The two isoforms bind to growth hormone in the same way on the surface of cells, but for reasons that are unclear, d3-GHR is associated with enhanced signaling within cells compared with fl-GHR.","Laron syndrome At least 70 mutations in the GHR gene have been found to cause Laron syndrome, a rare form of short stature that is also characterized by obesity, a distinctive facial appearance, and other signs and symptoms affecting multiple body systems. All of the identified mutations impair the function of the growth hormone receptor. Most of the mutations affect the extracellular region of the receptor, preventing it from binding to growth hormone effectively. A few mutations affect the intracellular region of the receptor, reducing or eliminating its ability to trigger the signals that promote growth.Although people with GHR gene mutations produce growth hormone, the defective receptors prevent cells from responding to the hormone by producing IGF-I or triggering cell growth and division. The cells' inability to react to growth hormone, which is described as growth hormone insensitivity, disrupts the normal growth of many different tissues. Short stature results when growth hormone cannot adequately stimulate the growth of bones. Changes in metabolism caused by insensitivity to growth hormone and the resulting shortage of IGF-I cause many of the other features of the condition, including obesity.Studies suggest that people with Laron syndrome have a significantly reduced risk of cancer and type 2 diabetes. Affected individuals appear to develop these common diseases much less frequently than their unaffected relatives, despite having obesity (a risk factor for both cancer and type 2 diabetes). Researchers are working to determine how mutations in the GHR gene may protect people with Laron syndrome from developing these diseases. Studies suggest that insensitivity to growth hormone may help prevent the uncontrolled growth and division of cells that can lead to the development of cancerous tumors. Growth hormone insensitivity also appears to alter how the body responds to insulin, which is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. Resistance to the effects of insulin is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. People with Laron syndrome have the opposite situation, an increased sensitivity to insulin, which likely helps explain their reduced risk of this disease. "
557,GHRHR ,growth hormone releasing hormone receptor,"The GHRHR gene provides instructions for making the growth hormone releasing hormone receptor. This receptor is active (expressed) on the growth-stimulating somatotropic cells in the pituitary gland. This gland is is located at the base of the brain and produces many hormones, including growth hormone. Growth hormone is necessary for the normal growth of the body's bones and tissues. The GHRHR receptor attaches (binds) to a molecule called growth hormone releasing hormone. This binding, along with the actions of other molecules, triggers the production of growth hormone and its release from the pituitary gland.","Isolated growth hormone deficiency More than 20 mutations in the GHRHR gene have been found to cause isolated growth hormone deficiency, a condition characterized by slow growth and short stature. Mutations in the GHRHR gene cause some cases of isolated growth hormone deficiency type IB. Most of these mutations replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the receptor protein, preventing the production of a functional receptor. A nonfunctional receptor cannot effectively trigger the production of growth hormone or signal its release from the pituitary gland. As a result, little growth hormone is produced or available in the body in people with GHRHR gene mutations, leading to isolated growth hormone deficiency type IB. "
558,GJA1 ,gap junction protein alpha 1,"The GJA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called connexin 43, which is one of 21 connexin proteins. Connexins play a role in cell-to-cell communication by forming channels, or gap junctions, between cells. Gap junctions allow for the transport of nutrients, charged particles (ions), and other small molecules that carry necessary communication signals between cells. In addition, connexin 43 attaches (binds) several signaling molecules that can relay communication signals inside the cell. Connexin 43 is found in many tissues such as the eyes, skin, bone, ears, heart, and brain, and it plays a role in their normal development and function.","Craniometaphyseal dysplasia A mutation in the GJA1 gene has been found to cause autosomal recessive craniometaphyseal dysplasia in a small number of people. This condition is characterized by thickening of bones in the skull (cranium) and widening of a region at the end of long bones known as the metaphysis. The mutation is present in both copies of the GJA1 gene. It changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the connexin 43 protein: at position 239, the amino acid arginine is replaced with the amino acid glutamine (written as Arg239Gln or R239Q). It is unknown how this change affects the function of the connexin 43 protein or leads to the bone abnormalities characteristic of craniometaphyseal dysplasia. "
559,GJB1 ,gap junction protein beta 1,"The GJB1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called connexin-32 (also known as gap junction beta 1). This protein is a member of the gap junction connexin family, which plays a role in cell communication by forming channels, or gap junctions, between cells. Gap junctions speed the transport of nutrients, charged particles (ions), and small molecules that carry communication signals between cells.The connexin-32 protein is made in several tissues, including those of the liver, pancreas, kidney, and nervous system. In the nervous system, this protein is located in the cell membrane of specialized cells called Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes. Schwann cells are found in the peripheral nervous system, which consists of nerves connecting the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) to muscles and sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and sound. Oligodendrocytes are located in the central nervous system.Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes surround nerves and are involved in the production and long-term maintenance of a fatty substance called myelin. Myelin forms a protective coating (or sheath) around certain nerve cells that ensures the smooth and rapid transmission of nerve impulses.The connexin-32 protein forms channels through the myelin sheath, allowing efficient transport and communication between the outer myelin layers and the interior of the Schwann cell or oligodendrocyte.","Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Researchers have identified more than 400 GJB1 gene mutations in people with type X Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a disorder characterized by muscle weakness and sensory problems, especially in the hands and feet. A few of these mutations also cause hearing loss in individuals with this type of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.Most GJB1 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the connexin-32 protein. It is unclear how these mutations lead to the characteristic features of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, including a loss of myelin (demyelination) and the slowed transmission of nerve impulses in the peripheral nervous system. The altered protein may be broken down quickly or trapped inside the cell, preventing it from reaching the cell membrane to form gap junctions. In some cases, an altered protein reaches the cell membrane but does not form properly functioning gap junctions. The loss of functional gap junctions probably impairs the normal activities of Schwann cells, including myelin production. Malfunctioning gap junctions could also disrupt communication between Schwann cells and the underlying nerve cell, disturbing the transmission of nerve impulses.In addition to the peripheral nervous system problems associated with this disorder, loss of myelin in the central nervous system has been reported in some people with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease caused by GJB1 gene mutations. These central nervous system abnormalities do not generally cause any symptoms. Research suggests that another connexin protein whose function overlaps with that of connexin-32 helps compensate for the mutated connexin-32 protein in the oligodendrocytes of the central nervous system. "
560,GJB2 ,gap junction protein beta 2,"The GJB2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called gap junction beta 2, more commonly known as connexin 26. Connexin 26 is a member of the connexin protein family. Connexin proteins form channels called gap junctions that permit the transport of nutrients, charged atoms (ions), and signaling molecules between adjoining cells. The size of the gap junction and the types of particles that move through it are determined by the particular connexin proteins that make up the channel. Gap junctions made with connexin 26 transport potassium ions and certain small molecules.Connexin 26 is found in cells throughout the body, including the inner ear. Because of its presence in the inner ear, especially the snail-shaped structure called the cochlea, researchers are interested in this protein's role in hearing. Hearing requires the conversion of sound waves to electrical nerve impulses. This conversion involves many processes, including maintenance of the proper level of potassium ions in the inner ear. Some studies indicate that channels made with connexin 26 help to maintain the correct level of potassium ions. Other research suggests that connexin 26 is required for the maturation of certain cells in the cochlea.Connexin 26 is also found in the skin. It is thought to play a role in the growth, maturation, and stability of the skin's outermost layer, the epidermis.","Bart-Pumphrey syndrome At least two GJB2 gene mutations have been identified in people with Bart-Pumphrey syndrome. This condition is characterized by a white discoloration of the nails (leukonychia), thickened skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (palmoplantar keratoderma), wart-like growths (knuckle pads) on the knuckles of the fingers and toes, and hearing loss. The GJB2 gene mutations that cause Bart-Pumphrey syndrome replace the protein building block (amino acid) glycine with the amino acid serine at protein position 59 (Gly59Ser or G59S) or replace the amino acid asparagine with the amino acid lysine at protein position 54 (Asn54Lys or N54K). The altered protein probably disrupts the function of normal connexin 26 in cells. This disruption could affect skin growth and also impair hearing by disturbing the conversion of sound waves to nerve impulses. "
561,GJB3 ,gap junction protein beta 3,"The GJB3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called gap junction beta 3, more commonly known as connexin 31. This protein is part of the connexin family, a group of proteins that form channels called gap junctions on the surface of cells. Gap junctions open and close to regulate the flow of nutrients, charged atoms (ions), and other signaling molecules from one cell to another. They are essential for direct communication between neighboring cells.Connexin 31 is found in several different parts of the body, including the outermost layer of the skin (the epidermis) and structures of the inner ear. Connexin 31 plays a role in the growth and maturation of cells in the epidermis. The exact role of this protein in the inner ear is less clear, although it appears to be involved in hearing.","Erythrokeratodermia variabilis et progressiva At least 15 GJB3 gene mutations have been identified in people with erythrokeratodermia variabilis et progressiva (EKVP), a skin disorder characterized by areas of hyperkeratosis, which is abnormally thickened skin, and temporarily reddened patches called erythematous areas. Each of these mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in connexin 31. Studies suggest that the abnormal protein produced from certain GJB3 gene mutations can build up in a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), triggering a harmful process known as ER stress. Researchers suspect that ER stress damages cells in the epidermis and leads to their premature death. Other GJB3 gene mutations result in the production of abnormal proteins that may form channels that do not function properly, which may also lead to premature cell death in the epidermis. In addition, abnormal connexin 31 proteins may interact with other connexin proteins, preventing the formation or function of other types of gap junctions. The mechanisms by which epidermal damage and cell death contribute to hyperkeratosis and erythematous areas are poorly understood. "
562,GJB4 ,gap junction protein beta 4,"The GJB4 gene provides instructions for making a protein called gap junction beta 4, more commonly known as connexin 30.3. This protein is part of the connexin family, a group of proteins that form channels called gap junctions on the surface of cells. Gap junctions open and close to regulate the flow of nutrients, charged atoms (ions), and other signaling molecules from one cell to another. They are essential for direct communication between neighboring cells.Connexin 30.3 is found in several different tissues, including the outermost layer of the skin (the epidermis). This protein appears to play a role in the growth and maturation of epidermal cells.","Erythrokeratodermia variabilis et progressiva At least eight GJB4 gene mutations have been identified in people with erythrokeratodermia variabilis et progressiva (EKVP), a skin disorder characterized by areas of hyperkeratosis, which is abnormally thickened skin, and temporarily reddened patches called erythematous areas. Each of these mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in connexin 30.3. Studies suggest that the abnormal protein can build up in a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), triggering a harmful process known as ER stress. Researchers suspect that ER stress damages cells in the epidermis and leads to their premature death. The mechanisms by which epidermal damage and cell death contribute to hyperkeratosis at erythematous areas are poorly understood. "
563,GJB6 ,gap junction protein beta 6,"The GJB6 gene provides instructions for making a protein called gap junction beta 6, more commonly known as connexin 30. Connexin 30 is a member of the connexin protein family. Connexin proteins form channels called gap junctions that permit the transport of nutrients, charged atoms (ions), and signaling molecules between adjoining cells. The size of the gap junction and the types of particles that move through it are determined by the particular connexin proteins that make up the channel. Gap junctions made with connexin 30 transport potassium ions and certain small molecules.Connexin 30 is found in several different tissues throughout the body, including the brain, inner ear, skin (especially the palms of the hands and soles of the feet), hair follicles, and nail beds. Because of its presence in the inner ear, researchers are interested in this protein's role in hearing. Hearing requires the conversion of sound waves to electrical nerve impulses. This conversion involves many processes, including maintenance of the proper level of potassium ions in the inner ear. Some studies indicate that gap junctions made with connexin 30 help to maintain the correct level of potassium ions.","Clouston syndrome At least four GJB6 gene mutations have been identified in people with a skin disorder called Clouston syndrome, which is also known as hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia 2. Characteristics of Clouston syndrome include fingernail abnormalities, hair loss, and thickened skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The GJB6 gene mutations that cause Clouston syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the connexin 30 protein. Although the effects of these mutations are not fully understood, they lead to abnormalities in the growth, division, and maturation of cells in the hair follicles, nails, and skin. "
564,GJC2 ,gap junction protein gamma 2,"The GJC2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called connexin-47. This protein is a member of the gap junction connexin family, a group of proteins that form channels called gap junctions between cells. Gap junctions allow for the transport of nutrients, charged particles (ions), and small molecules between cells.Connexin-47 is produced in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), specifically in cells called oligodendrocytes, which help coat nerve cells with a protective layer called myelin. Myelin is a fatty substance that insulates nerve fibers and promotes the rapid transmission of nerve impulses.Connexin-47 forms gap junctions that facilitate communication between oligodendrocytes or between oligodendrocytes and another type of nervous system cell called astrocytes. Communication between these cells is necessary for the formation and maintenance of myelin.","Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease type 1 At least 30 mutations in the GJC2 gene have been found to cause Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease type 1. This condition affects the nervous system's white matter, which consists of nerve fibers covered by myelin. Individuals with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease type 1 have neurological problems that typically cause movement abnormalities and less frequently, vision problems.Two GJC2 gene mutations that appear in up to one-third of people with this condition occur in an area of the GJC2 gene called the promoter region, which helps control the production of connexin-47. These mutations reduce the production of connexin-47, leading to a decrease in gap junction formation. Other GJC2 gene mutations prevent the connexin-47 protein from reaching the cell membrane where it is needed to form gap junctions. Still other GJC2 gene mutations decrease the function of the protein in the gap junction, reducing the overall efficacy of the channel.All of the GJC2 gene mutations that cause this condition affect both copies of the gene in each cell. They disrupt the communication between nerve cells that normally occurs at gap junctions and impair myelin formation. These changes lead to nerve damage that impairs nervous system function, resulting in the signs and symptoms of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease type 1. "
565,GLA ,galactosidase alpha,"The GLA gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A. This enzyme is active in lysosomes, which are structures that act as recycling centers within cells. Lysosomes use digestive enzymes to process worn-out cell components and recycle usable parts.Alpha-galactosidase A breaks down a molecule called globotriaosylceramide, which consists of three sugars attached to a fatty substance. This molecule is degraded as part of the normal recycling of old red blood cells (erythrocytes) and other types of cells.","Fabry disease More than 370 mutations in the GLA gene have been identified in people with Fabry disease. Most of these genetic changes are unique to single families. The most common type of mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in alpha-galactosidase A. Other mutations delete part of the GLA gene, insert extra genetic material into the gene, or insert a premature stop signal in the gene's instructions for making alpha-galactosidase A. Alterations in the GLA gene produce an abnormal version of the enzyme that is unable to break down globotriaosylceramide effectively. As a result, this substance builds up in the body's cells, particularly cells lining blood vessels in the skin and cells in the kidneys, heart, and nervous system. The progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide damages these cells, leading to the varied signs and symptoms of Fabry disease.Mutations that eliminate the activity of the alpha-galactosidase A enzyme lead to the severe, classic form of Fabry disease, which typically begins in childhood. Mutations that reduce but do not completely eliminate the enzyme's activity usually cause milder, late-onset forms of the disorder. "
566,GLB1 ,galactosidase beta 1,"The GLB1 gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called beta-galactosidase (β-galactosidase). This enzyme is located in lysosomes, which are compartments within cells that break down and recycle different types of molecules. Within lysosomes, β-galactosidase helps break down certain molecules, including substances called GM1 ganglioside and keratan sulfate. GM1 ganglioside is important for normal functioning of nerve cells in the brain, and keratan sulfate is particularly abundant in cartilage and the clear covering of the eye (cornea). Keratan sulfate belongs to a group of large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) or mucopolysaccharides.The GLB1 gene also provides instructions for making the elastin-binding protein. On the cell surface, elastin-binding protein interacts with proteins called cathepsin A and neuraminidase 1 to form the elastin receptor complex. This receptor complex plays a role in the formation of elastic fibers, which are a component of the connective tissue that forms the body's supportive framework.","GM1 gangliosidosis More than 80 mutations in the GLB1 gene have been found to cause GM1 gangliosidosis. Most mutations change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the GLB1 gene. These mutations often affect the production of both β-galactosidase and elastin-binding protein.GLB1 gene mutations that cause GM1 gangliosidosis reduce or eliminate the activity of β-galactosidase. Without enough functional β-galactosidase, GM1 ganglioside and keratan sulfate cannot be broken down. As a result, these substances accumulate to toxic levels in many tissues and organs. In the brain, progressive damage caused by the buildup of GM1 ganglioside leads to the destruction of nerve cells, which causes many of the signs and symptoms of GM1 gangliosidosis.Although the role elastin-binding protein plays in the development of GM1 gangliosidosis is unclear, the alteration of this protein may contribute to the weakened heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) found in some people with GM1 gangliosidosis. "
567,GLDC ,glycine decarboxylase,"The GLDC gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called glycine dehydrogenase. This enzyme is one of four components (subunits) that make up a large complex called glycine cleavage enzyme. Within cells, this complex is active in specialized energy-producing centers called mitochondria.As its name suggests, glycine cleavage enzyme processes a molecule called glycine by cutting (cleaving) it into smaller pieces. Glycine is an amino acid, which is a building block of proteins. This molecule also acts as a neurotransmitter, which is a chemical messenger that transmits signals in the brain. The breakdown of excess glycine is necessary for the normal development and function of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.","Glycine encephalopathy Mutations in the GLDC gene account for about 80 percent of all cases of glycine encephalopathy. More than 40 mutations have been identified in affected individuals. Many of these genetic changes alter single amino acids in glycine dehydrogenase. For example, the most common GLDC mutation in the Finnish population replaces the amino acid serine with the amino acid isoleucine at position 564 in the enzyme (also written as Ser564Ile or S564I). Other mutations insert or delete genetic material in the GLDC gene, or disrupt how genetic information from the gene is spliced together to make a blueprint for producing glycine dehydrogenase.Some GLDC mutations lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of glycine dehydrogenase, while other mutations reduce but do not eliminate the enzyme's activity. When an altered version of this enzyme is incorporated into the glycine cleavage enzyme complex, it prevents the complex from breaking down glycine properly. As a result, excess glycine can build up to toxic levels in the body's organs and tissues. Damage caused by harmful amounts of this molecule in the brain and spinal cord is responsible for the intellectual disability, seizures, and breathing difficulties characteristic of glycine encephalopathy. "
568,GLI3 ,GLI family zinc finger 3,"The GLI3 gene belongs to a family of genes that are involved in the normal shaping (patterning) of many tissues and organs during the early stages of development before birth. To carry out this role, proteins produced from genes in the GLI family attach to specific regions of DNA and help control whether particular genes are turned on or off (gene expression). GLI proteins are called transcription factors on the basis of this action.Proteins in the GLI family function in the same molecular pathway as a protein called Sonic Hedgehog. This pathway is essential for early development. It plays a role in cell growth, cell specialization, and the patterning of structures such as the brain and limbs. Depending on signals from Sonic Hedgehog, the GLI3 protein can either turn on (activate) or turn off (repress) other genes. Researchers are working to identify the genes targeted by the GLI3 protein during development.","Acrocallosal syndrome At least two mutations in the GLI3 gene have been reported in people with features of acrocallosal syndrome, a rare condition characterized by certain brain abnormalities, extra fingers and toes (polydactyly), and distinctive facial features, including widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism) and a prominent forehead. These signs and symptoms overlap significantly with those of Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (described below), so acrocallosal syndrome resulting from GLI3 gene mutations is sometimes considered a severe form of that condition.The GLI3 gene mutations that cause acrocallosal syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in a particular region of the GLI3 protein, which disrupts the protein's function. The malfunctioning protein likely alters the expression of certain genes during early development. The role of the GLI3 protein in brain and limb patterning may help explain why mutations lead to brain abnormalities, polydactyly, and the other features of acrocallosal syndrome. "
569,GLRA1 ,glycine receptor alpha 1,"The GLRA1 gene provides instructions for making one part, the alpha (α)1 subunit, of the glycine receptor protein. The glycine receptor is embedded in the membrane of nerve cells (neurons) in the spinal cord and the part of the brain that is connected to the spinal cord (the brainstem). The glycine receptor is made up of five subunits: two α1 subunits and three beta (β) subunits. The β subunit is produced from a different gene.Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other molecules, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. Together, ligands and their receptors trigger signals that affect cell development and function. The ligand for the glycine receptor is the protein building block (amino acid) glycine. This molecule also acts as a neurotransmitter, which is a chemical messenger that transmits signals in the nervous system.When glycine attaches (binds) to the glycine receptor, the receptor opens to allow negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions) to enter the neuron. This influx of chloride ions reduces the neurons's ability to transmit signals to other neurons. Because they stop (inhibit) signaling, glycine receptors are known as inhibitory receptors.","Hereditary hyperekplexia More than 60 mutations in the GLRA1 gene have been found to cause hereditary hyperekplexia. This condition is most often seen in infants who experience increased muscle tone (hypertonia) and an exaggerated startle reaction to unexpected stimuli, especially loud noises. The startle reaction can trigger a brief period of rigidity and immobility, and in some cases, infants stop breathing. Most GLRA1 gene mutations change single amino acids in the α1 subunit of the glycine receptor protein. The most common mutation replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid leucine at protein position 271 (written as Arg271Leu or R271L).GLRA1 gene mutations that cause hereditary hyperekplexia impair the ability of the glycine receptor protein to respond to the ligand glycine. Some GLRA1 gene mutations alter the structure of the glycine receptor, which can prevent the receptor from opening or cause it to open without the presence of glycine. Other mutations prevent the receptor from reaching the cell membrane. When the glycine receptor is dysfunctional or missing, chloride ions enter the cell when they are not needed or cannot enter the cell at all. The resulting increase in cell signaling in the spinal cord and brainstem likely causes the abnormal muscle movements, exaggerated startle reaction, and other signs and symptoms of hereditary hyperekplexia. "
570,GM2A ,GM2 ganglioside activator,"The GM2A gene provides instructions for making a protein called the GM2 ganglioside activator. This protein is necessary for the normal function of an enzyme called beta-hexosaminidase A, which plays a critical role in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). Beta-hexosaminidase A and the GM2 ganglioside activator protein work together in lysosomes, which are structures in cells that break down toxic substances and act as recycling centers. Within lysosomes, the activator protein binds to a fatty substance called GM2 ganglioside and presents it to beta-hexosaminidase A to be broken down.","GM2-gangliosidosis, AB variant Only a few mutations in the GM2A gene have been identified in people with GM2-gangliosidosis, AB variant. Some of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the GM2 ganglioside activator. Other mutations delete a small amount of DNA from the GM2A gene. These genetic changes result in an unstable activator protein that is quickly degraded, or they prevent the gene from making any functional protein. Without the GM2 ganglioside activator, beta-hexosaminidase A is unable to break down GM2 ganglioside. As a result, this substance builds up to toxic levels, particularly in nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Progressive damage caused by the buildup of GM2 ganglioside leads to the destruction of these cells, which causes the signs and symptoms of the AB variant. "
571,GNA11 ,G protein subunit alpha 11,"The GNA11 gene provides instructions for making one component, the alpha (α) subunit, of a protein complex called a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein). Each G protein is composed of three proteins called the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. Specifically, the protein produced from the GNA11 gene, called Gα11, is the alpha subunit for a G protein called G11.In a process called signal transduction, G proteins trigger a complex network of signaling pathways that ultimately influence many cell functions. The G11 protein plays many roles in cells. It works with another protein called the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) to affect processes that regulate calcium levels in the blood. CaSR proteins in kidney cells and cells of the parathyroid gland sense when a certain concentration of calcium in the blood is reached; the CaSR protein then stimulates the G11 subunits, including Gα11, to send signals that block processes that increase the amount of calcium in the blood. In particular, this signaling blocks the production and release of a hormone called parathyroid hormone. Parathyroid hormone enhances the release of calcium into the blood, so blocking this hormone prevents calcium release. In the kidneys, which filter fluid and waste products in the body and can reabsorb needed nutrients and release them back into the blood, G11 signaling blocks the reabsorption of calcium from the filtered fluids.G11 signaling is also involved in the growth and division (proliferation) and self-destruction (apoptosis) of cells in tissues throughout the body, including those in the eyes, skin, heart, and brain.","Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia At least five mutations in the GNA11 gene have been found in individuals with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 2. This condition is characterized by low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia). The mutations involved in this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in Gα11. These genetic changes are called activating mutations because the altered alpha subunit is overactive, sending signals to block a rise in calcium levels, even when levels are very low. As a result, calcium levels in the blood remain abnormally low, causing hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia can cause muscle cramping and seizures, although about half of people with the condition have no associated health problems.Because overactive Gα11 signaling blocks the production of parathyroid hormone, the levels of this hormone in the blood can be abnormally low, which is known as hypoparathyroidism. For this reason, autosomal dominant hypocalcemia is sometimes referred to as autosomal dominant hypoparathyroidism. "
572,GNAI3 ,G protein subunit alpha i3,"The GNAI3 gene provides instructions for making one component, the inhibitory alpha subunit, of a protein complex called a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein). G proteins are composed of three protein subunits: alpha, beta, and gamma. Each of these subunits is produced from a different gene.Through a process called signal transduction, G proteins trigger a complex network of signaling pathways within cells. These pathways help transmit information from outside the cell to inside the cell. Specifically, G proteins made with the GNAI3 inhibitory alpha subunit reduce (inhibit) the activity of an enzyme called adenylyl cyclase, which is an important chemical messenger within cells. G protein signaling ultimately influences many cell activities, instructing the cell to grow, divide, or take on specialized functions.Studies suggest that G protein signaling involving the GNAI3 inhibitory alpha subunit contributes to the development of the first and second pharyngeal arches. These embryonic structures ultimately develop into the jawbones, facial muscles, middle ear bones, ear canals, outer ears, and related tissues.","Auriculo-condylar syndrome At least two mutations in the GNAI3 gene have been found to cause auriculo-condylar syndrome, a disorder that primarily affects the development of the ears and lower jaw (mandible). The identified mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the inhibitory alpha subunit. These mutations likely alter the structure of the inhibitory alpha subunit and impair G protein signaling. Abnormal signaling alters the formation of the lower jaw: instead of developing normally, the lower jaw becomes shaped more like the smaller upper jaw (maxilla). The abnormal shape leads to an unusually small chin (micrognathia) and problems with jaw function. Researchers are working to determine how mutations in this gene lead to the other developmental abnormalities associated with auriculo-condylar syndrome. "
573,GNAQ ,G protein subunit alpha q,"The GNAQ gene provides instructions for making a protein called guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(q) subunit alpha (Gαq). The Gαq protein is part of a group of proteins called the trimeric G protein complex. This complex attaches (binds) to other proteins called G protein coupled receptors. When the protein complex is bound to a receptor, the Gαq protein binds to a molecule called GTP and is turned on (activated). The activated Gαq protein then separates from the protein complex and activates signaling pathways that help to regulate the development and function of blood vessels. The Gαq protein converts GTP to a similar molecule called GDP, which turns off (inactivates) the protein. It then reattaches to the trimeric G protein complex, turning off the signaling pathways.","Sturge-Weber syndrome At least one mutation in the GNAQ gene has been found to cause Sturge-Weber syndrome. Sturge-Weber syndrome is a condition that affects the development of certain blood vessels and often leads to three major features: a red or pink birthmark called a port-wine birthmark, brain abnormalities, and increased pressure in the eye (glaucoma) or other eye problems. The GNAQ gene mutation associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome changes a single building block (amino acid) in the Gαq protein. It replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid glutamine at position 183 in the Gαq protein (written as Arg183Gln or R183Q). This mutation is not inherited but occurs after conception. This alteration is called a somatic mutation and is present only in certain cells, specifically cells in the brain, eyes, and skin that are involved in blood vessel formation.Following its activation, the altered Gαq protein cannot convert GTP to GDP. As a result, the protein is always active, and signaling pathways controlled by it are constantly turned on. This increased signaling likely disrupts the regulation of blood vessel development, causing abnormal and excessive formation of vessels before birth in people with Sturge-Weber syndrome. "
574,GNAS ,GNAS complex locus,"The GNAS gene provides instructions for making one component, the stimulatory alpha subunit, of a protein complex called a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein). Each G protein is composed of three proteins called the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits.In a process called signal transduction, G proteins trigger a complex network of signaling pathways that ultimately influence many cell functions by regulating the activity of hormones. The G protein made with the subunit produced from the GNAS gene helps stimulate the activity of an enzyme called adenylate cyclase. This enzyme is involved in controlling the production of several hormones that help regulate the activity of endocrine glands such as the thyroid, pituitary gland, ovaries and testes (gonads), and adrenal glands. Adenylate cyclase is also believed to play a key role in signaling pathways that help regulate the development of bone (osteogenesis). In this way, the enzyme helps prevent the body from producing bone tissue in the wrong place (ectopic bone).","McCune-Albright syndrome At least three GNAS gene mutations have been identified in people with McCune-Albright syndrome, a disorder that affects the bones, skin, and several hormone-producing (endocrine) tissues. These mutations result in an abnormal version of the G protein that causes the adenylate cyclase enzyme to be constantly turned on (constitutively activated). Constitutive activation of the adenylate cyclase enzyme leads to over-production of several hormones, resulting in the signs and symptoms of McCune-Albright syndrome.McCune-Albright syndrome is not inherited. The gene mutation that causes this disorder is described as somatic. Instead of being passed from parent to child, somatic mutations are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. McCune-Albright syndrome is caused by a random mutation in the GNAS gene that occurs very early in development. As a result, some of the body's cells have a normal version of the GNAS gene, while other cells have the mutated version. This phenomenon is called mosaicism. The severity of this disorder and its specific features depend on the number and location of cells that have the mutated GNAS gene. "
575,GNAT1 ,G protein subunit alpha transducin 1,"The GNAT1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called alpha (α)-transducin. This protein is one part (the alpha subunit) of a protein complex called transducin. There are several versions of transducin made up of different subunits. Each version is found in a particular cell type in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina), where it plays a role in transmitting visual signals from the eye to the brain.The transducin complex that contains α-transducin is found only in specialized light receptor cells in the retina called rods. Rods are responsible for vision in low-light conditions. When light enters the eye, a rod cell protein called rhodopsin is turned on (activated), which then activates α-transducin. Once activated, α-transducin breaks away from the transducin complex in order to activate another protein called cGMP-PDE, which triggers a series of chemical reactions that create electrical signals. These signals are transmitted from rod cells to the brain, where they are interpreted as vision.","Autosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness At least two mutations in the GNAT1 gene have been found to cause autosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness, which is characterized by the inability to see in low light.One of these mutations impairs the protein's ability to activate cGMP-PDE; the other mutation results in a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). Both of these mutations disrupt the pathway that creates visual signals to be sent from rod cells to the brain. A nonfunctional α-transducin protein stops the signaling pathway. When α-transducin is constitutively activated, the signals that the rod cells send to the brain are constantly occurring, even in bright light. Visual information from rod cells is then perceived by the brain as not meaningful, resulting in night blindness. "
576,GNAT2 ,G protein subunit alpha transducin 2,"The GNAT2 gene provides instructions for making one part (called the cone-specific alpha subunit) of a protein called transducin. This protein is found in light-detecting (photoreceptor) cells called cones, which are located in a specialized tissue at the back of the eye known as the retina. Cones provide vision in bright light (daylight vision), including color vision. Other photoreceptor cells, called rods, provide vision in low light (night vision).Transducin plays an essential role in transmitting visual signals from photoreceptor cells in the retina to the brain through a process called phototransduction. Photoreceptors contain special pigments (called photopigments) that absorb light. The photopigments activate transducin, which triggers a series of chemical reactions within the cell. These reactions alter the cell's electrical charge, ultimately generating a signal that is interpreted by the brain as vision.","Achromatopsia At least 10 mutations in the GNAT2 gene have been found to cause the vision disorder achromatopsia. These mutations are a relatively uncommon cause of complete achromatopsia, a form of the disorder characterized by a total lack of color vision and other vision problems that are present from early infancy. GNAT2 gene mutations have also been identified in a few individuals with incomplete achromatopsia, a milder form of the disorder associated with limited color vision.The GNAT2 gene mutations that underlie complete achromatopsia lead to an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the cone-specific alpha subunit of transducin. Without this subunit, cones have no functional transducin, and they are unable to carry out phototransduction. (The subunit produced from the GNAT2 gene is specific to cones, so rods are typically unaffected by this disorder.) A loss of cone function underlies the lack of color vision and other vision problems in people with complete achromatopsia.At least one known GNAT2 gene mutation causes incomplete achromatopsia. The mutation, which is written as c.461+2G>A, affects the way the gene's instructions are pieced together to form the subunit protein. This mutation allows the production of some functional cone-specific alpha subunit, although the amount of the subunit is greatly reduced. As a result, a small amount of functional transducin is available to play its role in phototransduction, and the partially functioning cones can transmit some visual information to the brain. "
577,GNE ,glucosamine (UDP-N-acetyl)-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase,"The GNE gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found in cells and tissues throughout the body. This enzyme plays a key role in a chemical pathway that produces sialic acid, which is a simple sugar that attaches to the ends of more complex molecules on the surface of cells. By modifying these molecules, sialic acid influences a wide variety of cellular functions including cell movement (migration), attaching cells to one another (adhesion), signaling between cells, and inflammation.The enzyme produced from the GNE gene is responsible for two steps in the formation of sialic acid. It first converts a molecule known as UDP-GlcNAc to a similar molecule called ManNAc. In the next step, the enzyme transfers a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) to ManNAc to create ManNAc-6-phosphate. Other enzymes then convert ManNAc-6-phosphate to sialic acid.","Inclusion body myopathy 2 More than 40 mutations in the GNE gene have been identified in people with inclusion body myopathy 2. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in several regions of the enzyme. A few mutations delete a piece of the enzyme or otherwise alter its structure.Different GNE mutations cause inclusion body myopathy 2 in different populations. One mutation causes the disorder in people of Iranian Jewish heritage; this genetic change replaces the amino acid methionine with the amino acid threonine at position 712 in a region of the enzyme known as the kinase domain (written as Met712Thr or M712T). In the Japanese population, where the condition is called Nonaka myopathy, the most common GNE mutation replaces the amino acid valine with the amino acid leucine at position 572 in the enzyme's kinase domain (written as Val572Leu or V572L).The mutations responsible for inclusion body myopathy 2 reduce the activity of the enzyme produced from the GNE gene, which decreases the production of sialic acid. As a result, less of this simple sugar is available to attach to cell surface molecules. Researchers are working to determine how a shortage of sialic acid leads to progressive muscle weakness in people with inclusion body myopathy 2. Sialic acid is important for the normal function of many different cells and tissues, so it is unclear why the signs and symptoms of this disorder appear to be limited to the skeletal muscles. "
578,GNMT ,glycine N-methyltransferase,"The GNMT gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme glycine N-methyltransferase. This enzyme is involved in a multistep process that breaks down the protein building block (amino acid) methionine. Specifically, glycine N-methyltransferase starts a reaction that converts the compounds glycine and S-adenosylmethionine (also called AdoMet) to N-methylglycine and S-adenosylhomocysteine (also called AdoHcy).This reaction also helps to control the relative amounts of AdoMet and AdoHcy. The AdoMet to AdoHcy ratio is important in many body processes, including the regulation of other genes by the addition of methyl groups, consisting of one carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms (methylation). Methylation is important in many cellular functions. These include determining whether the instructions in a particular segment of DNA are carried out, regulating reactions involving proteins and lipids, and controlling the processing of chemicals that relay signals in the nervous system (neurotransmitters).The glycine N-methyltransferase enzyme is also involved in processing toxic compounds in the liver.","Hypermethioninemia Three mutations in the GNMT gene have been described in individuals with hypermethioninemia. In an Italian family, one mutation substitutes the amino acid proline for the amino acid leucine at protein position 49 (written as Leu49Pro or L49P) and another mutation substitutes the amino acid asparagine for the amino acid histidine at position 176 (written as His176Asn or H176N). In a Greek patient of Roma origin, a mutation was identified that substitutes the amino acid serine for the amino acid asparagine at position 140 (written as Asn140Ser or N140S). The reduced glycine N-methyltransferase activity resulting from these mutations causes hypermethioninemia in affected individuals. "
579,GNPAT ,glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase,"The GNPAT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme known as glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase (GNPAT) or dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase (DHAPAT). This enzyme is found in structures called peroxisomes, which are sac-like compartments within cells that contain enzymes needed to break down many different substances. Peroxisomes are also important for the production of fats (lipids) used in digestion and in the nervous system.Within peroxisomes, the DHAPAT enzyme is responsible for the first step in the production of lipid molecules called plasmalogens. These molecules are found in cell membranes throughout the body. They are also abundant in myelin, which is the protective substance that covers nerve cells. However, little is known about the functions of plasmalogens. Researchers suspect that these molecules may help protect cells from oxidative stress, which occurs when unstable molecules called free radicals accumulate to levels that damage or kill cells. Plasmalogens may also play important roles in interactions between lipids and proteins, the transmission of chemical signals in cells, and the fusion of cell membranes.","Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata At least five mutations in the GNPAT gene have been found to cause rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 2 (RCDP2). These mutations prevent cells from making any functional DHAPAT enzyme. A shortage of this enzyme disrupts peroxisome function and severely reduces the amount of plasmalogens within cells. It is unclear how these abnormalities lead to shortened long bones, intellectual disability, and the other characteristic features of RCDP2. "
580,GNPTAB ,N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase subunits alpha and beta,"The GNPTAB gene provides instructions for making two different parts, the alpha and beta subunits, of an enzyme called GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. This enzyme is made up of two alpha (α), two beta (β), and two gamma (γ) subunits. The gamma subunit is produced from a different gene, called GNPTG. GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase helps prepare certain newly made enzymes for transport to lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments within the cell that use digestive enzymes called hydrolases to break down large molecules into smaller ones that can be reused by cells.GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase is involved in the first step of making a molecule called mannose-6-phosphate (M6P). M6P acts as a tag that indicates a hydrolase should be transported to the lysosome. Specifically, GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase transfers a molecule called GlcNAc-1-phosphate to a newly produced hydrolase. In the next step, a molecule is removed to reveal an M6P attached to the hydrolase. Once a hydrolase has an M6P tag, it can be transported to a lysosome.","Mucolipidosis II alpha/beta Around 50 mutations in the GNPTAB gene have been found to cause mucolipidosis II alpha/beta. These mutations prevent the production of any functional GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. Without this enzyme, hydrolases cannot be tagged with M6P and transported to lysosomes. Instead, hydrolases end up outside the cell and have increased digestive activity. The lack of hydrolases within lysosomes causes large molecules to accumulate there. Conditions that cause molecules to build up inside lysosomes, including mucolipidosis II alpha/beta, are called lysosomal storage disorders. The signs and symptoms of mucolipidosis II alpha/beta are most likely caused by the lack of hydrolases within lysosomes and the effects these enzymes have outside the cell. "
581,GNPTG ,N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase subunit gamma,"The GNPTG gene provides instructions for making one part, the gamma subunit, of an enzyme called GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. This enzyme is made up of two alpha (α), two beta (β), and two gamma (γ) subunits. The alpha and beta subunits are produced from a different gene, called GNPTAB. GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase helps prepare certain newly made enzymes for transport to lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments within the cell that use digestive enzymes called hydrolases to break down large molecules into smaller ones that can be reused by cells.GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase is involved in the first step of making a molecule called mannose-6-phosphate (M6P). M6P acts as a tag that indicates a hydrolase should be transported to the lysosome. Specifically, GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase transfers a molecule called GlcNac-1-phosphate to a newly produced hydrolase. In the next step, a molecule is removed to reveal an M6P attached to the hydrolase. Once a hydrolase has an M6P tag, it can be transported to a lysosome.","Mucolipidosis III gamma At least 8 mutations in the GNPTG gene have been found to cause mucolipidosis III gamma. These mutations result in reduced the activity of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, which disrupts tagging of hydrolases with M6P. Digestive enzymes that do not receive the M6P tag end up outside the cell, where they have increased activity. The shortage of these digestive enzymes within lysosomes causes large molecules to accumulate there. Conditions that cause molecules to build up inside lysosomes, including mucolipidosis III gamma, are called lysosomal storage disorders. The signs and symptoms of mucolipidosis III gamma are most likely due to the shortage of hydrolases inside lysosomes and the effects these enzymes have outside the cell. "
582,GNS ,glucosamine (N-acetyl)-6-sulfatase,"The GNS gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase. This enzyme is located in lysosomes, compartments within cells that digest and recycle different types of molecules. N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase is involved in the step-wise breakdown of large molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are composed of sugar molecules that are linked together to form a long string. To break down these large molecules, individual sugars are removed one at a time from one end of the molecule. N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase removes a chemical group known as a sulfate from a subset of GAGs called heparan sulfate when the sugar N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate is located at the end.","Mucopolysaccharidosis type III Mutations in the GNS gene cause mucopolysaccharidosis type IIID (MPS IIID). Most of these mutations change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the gene. All of the mutations that cause MPS IIID reduce or eliminate the function of N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase.The lack of N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase activity disrupts the breakdown of heparan sulfate. As a result, partially broken down GAGs accumulate within lysosomes. Researchers believe that the accumulation of GAGs interferes with the functions of other proteins inside the lysosomes and disrupts the normal functions of cells. It is unknown why the buildup of heparan sulfate mostly affects the central nervous system in MPS IIID. "
583,GP1BA ,glycoprotein Ib platelet subunit alpha,"The GP1BA gene provides instructions for making a protein called glycoprotein Ib-alpha (GPIbα). This protein is one piece (subunit) of a protein complex called GPIb-IX-V, which plays a role in blood clotting. GPIb-IX-V is found on the surface of small cells called platelets, which circulate in blood and are an essential component of blood clots. The complex can attach (bind) to a protein called von Willebrand factor, fitting together like a lock and its key. Von Willebrand factor is found on the inside surface of blood vessels, particularly when there is an injury. Binding of the GPIb-IX-V complex to von Willebrand factor allows platelets to stick to the blood vessel wall at the site of the injury. These platelets form clots, plugging holes in the blood vessels to help stop bleeding.To form the GPIb-IX-V complex, GPIbα interacts with other protein subunits called GPIb-beta, GPIX, and GPV, each of which is produced from a different gene. GPIbα is essential for assembly of the complex at the platelet surface. It is the piece of the complex that interacts with von Willebrand factor to trigger blood clotting. GPIbα also interacts with other blood clotting proteins to aid in other steps of the clotting process.","Bernard-Soulier syndrome At least 54 GP1BA gene mutations have been found to cause Bernard-Soulier syndrome, a condition characterized by a reduced number of platelets that are larger than normal (macrothrombocytopenia) and excessive bleeding. Some of these mutations lead to production of an altered GPIbα subunit that is likely broken down too soon or that cannot get to the platelet surface. Lack of this subunit on the surface of platelets prevents formation of the GPIb-IX-V complex. Without GPIb-IX-V, platelets cannot come together at the site of an injury to form a clot, leading to the bleeding problems associated with Bernard-Soulier syndrome. Other mutations lead to production of a subunit that can form GPIb-IX-V complexes but cannot interact with von Willebrand factor, which also impairs the accumulation of platelets necessary for clotting. "
584,GP1BB ,glycoprotein Ib platelet subunit beta,"The GP1BB gene provides instructions for making a protein called glycoprotein 1b-beta (GPIbβ). This protein is one piece (subunit) of a protein complex called GPIb-IX-V, which plays a role in blood clotting. GPIb-IX-V is found on the surface of small cells called platelets, which circulate in blood and are an essential component of blood clots. The complex can attach (bind) to a protein called von Willebrand factor, fitting together like a lock and its key. Von Willebrand factor is found on the inside surface of blood vessels, particularly when there is an injury. Binding of the GPIb-IX-V complex to von Willebrand factor allows platelets to stick to the blood vessel wall at the site of the injury. These platelets form clots, plugging holes in the blood vessels to help stop bleeding.To form the GPIb-IX-V complex, GPIbβ interacts with other protein subunits called GPIb-alpha, GPIX, and GPV, each of which is produced from a different gene. GPIbβ is essential for assembly of the complex at the platelet surface and helps stabilize the complex once it is formed.","Bernard-Soulier syndrome At least 32 GP1BB gene mutations have been found to cause Bernard-Soulier syndrome, a condition characterized by a reduced number of platelets that are larger than normal (macrothrombocytopenia) and excessive bleeding. These mutations lead to production of an altered GPIbβ subunit that is likely broken down too soon or that cannot get to the platelet surface. Lack of this subunit on the surface of platelets prevents formation of the GPIb-IX-V complex. Without GPIb-IX-V, platelets cannot come together at the site of an injury to form a clot, leading to the bleeding problems associated with Bernard-Soulier syndrome. "
585,GP6 ,glycoprotein VI platelet,"The GP6 gene provides instructions for making a protein called glycoprotein VI (GPVI). GPVI is a receptor protein that is embedded in the outer membrane of blood cells called platelets, which are an essential component of blood clots. Normally, blood clots protect the body after an injury by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss.Receptor proteins, like GPVI, have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. Together, ligands and their receptors trigger signals that affect cell function. The main ligand for GPVI is a protein called collagen, which is found on blood vessel walls. In response to an injury that causes bleeding, the GPVI protein attaches (binds) to collagen, which begins clot formation and signals additional platelets to come together to increase the size of the clot. The GPVI protein can also bind to a protein called fibrin, which is the main protein that forms blood clots.","Glycoprotein VI deficiency At least five mutations in the GP6 gene have been found to cause glycoprotein VI deficiency, a bleeding disorder associated with a decreased ability to form blood clots. The mutations lead to the production of no GPVI protein; an abnormally short, nonfunctional GPVI protein; or a protein that is less able to bind to collagen. Without GPVI binding to collagen, platelets cannot come together efficiently at the site of an injury to form a clot, leading to an increased risk of nosebleeds, abnormally heavy or prolonged bleeding following minor injury or surgery, or other bleeding problems associated with glycoprotein VI deficiency. "
586,GP9 ,glycoprotein IX platelet,"The GP9 gene provides instructions for making a protein called glycoprotein IX (GPIX). This protein is one piece (subunit) of a protein complex called GPIb-IX-V, which plays a role in blood clotting. GPIb-IX-V is found on the surface of small cells called platelets, which circulate in blood and are an essential component of blood clots. The complex can attach (bind) to a protein called von Willebrand factor, fitting together like a lock and its key. Von Willebrand factor is found on the inside surface of blood vessels, particularly when there is an injury. Binding of the GPIb-IX-V complex to von Willebrand factor allows platelets to stick to the blood vessel wall at the site of the injury. These platelets form clots, plugging holes in the blood vessels to help stop bleeding.To form the GPIb-IX-V complex, GPIX interacts with other protein subunits called GPIb-alpha, GPIb-beta, and GPV, each of which is produced from a different gene. GPIX is essential for assembly of the complex at the platelet surface and helps stabilize the complex once it is formed.","Bernard-Soulier syndrome At least 28 GP9 gene mutations have been found to cause Bernard-Soulier syndrome, a condition characterized by a reduced number of platelets that are larger than normal (macrothrombocytopenia) and excessive bleeding. These mutations lead to production of an altered GPIX subunit that is likely broken down too soon or that cannot get to the platelet surface. Lack of this subunit on the surface of platelets prevents formation of the GPIb-IX-V complex. Without GPIb-IX-V, platelets cannot come together at the site of an injury to form a clot, leading to the bleeding problems associated with Bernard-Soulier syndrome. "
587,GPC3 ,glypican 3,"The GPC3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called glypican 3. This protein is one of several glypicans in humans, each of which consists of a core protein attached to long sugar molecules called heparan sulfate chains. Glypicans are anchored to the outer cell membrane, where they interact with a variety of other proteins outside the cell. Glypicans appear to play important roles in development before birth. These proteins are involved in numerous cell functions, including regulating cell growth and division (cell proliferation) and cell survival.Several studies have found that glypican 3 interacts with other proteins at the surface of cells to restrain cell proliferation. Specifically, glypican 3 blocks (inhibits) a developmental pathway called the hedgehog signaling pathway. This pathway is critical for cell proliferation, cell specialization, and the normal shaping (patterning) of many parts of the body during embryonic development.Researchers believe that in some cell types, glypican 3 may act as a tumor suppressor, which is a protein that prevents cells from growing and dividing in an uncontrolled way to form a cancerous tumor. Glypican 3 may also cause some types of cells to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis) when they are no longer needed, which can help keep growth in check.Although glypican 3 is known primarily as an inhibitor of cell growth and cell division, in some tissues it appears to have the opposite effect. Research suggests that in certain types of cells, such as cells in the liver, glypican 3 may interact with proteins called growth factors to promote cell growth and cell division.","Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome More than 50 mutations in the GPC3 gene have been identified in people with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome. This condition is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal at birth (macrosomia) and continue to grow and gain weight at an unusual rate. The condition can also be associated with a variety of other birth defects and health problems.Most of the mutations that cause Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome delete part or all of the GPC3 gene, which prevents cells from producing functional glypican 3. Other mutations insert or delete a small amount of genetic material in the gene, or change one or a few protein building blocks (amino acids) in glypican 3. These mutations change the structure of the protein.Mutations in the GPC3 gene prevent glypican 3 from inhibiting the hedgehog signaling pathway. The resulting overactivity of this pathway leads to an increased rate of cell growth and division starting before birth. This increased cell proliferation accounts, at least in part, for the overgrowth that occurs in Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome. It is unclear how changes in hedgehog signaling contribute to the other abnormalities that can occur with this disorder. "
588,GPHN ,gephyrin,"The GPHN gene provides instructions for making a protein called gephyrin, which has two major functions in the body: the protein aids in the formation (biosynthesis) of a molecule called molybdenum cofactor, and it also plays a role in communication between nerve cells (neurons).Gephyrin performs the final two steps in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis. Molybdenum cofactor, which contains the element molybdenum, is essential to the function of several enzymes called sulfite oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, xanthine dehydrogenase, and mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component (mARC). These enzymes help break down (metabolize) different substances in the body, some of which are toxic if not metabolized.Gephyrin also plays an important role in neurons. Communication between neurons depends on chemicals called neurotransmitters. To relay signals, a neuron releases neurotransmitters, which attach to receptor proteins on neighboring neurons. Gephyrin anchors certain receptor proteins to the correct location in neurons so that the receptors can receive the signals relayed by neurotransmitters.","Molybdenum cofactor deficiency GPHN gene mutations cause a disorder called molybdenum cofactor deficiency. This disorder is characterized by seizures that begin early in life and brain dysfunction that worsens over time (encephalopathy); the condition is usually fatal by early childhood. At least two mutations in the GPHN gene have been found to cause a form of the disorder designated type C or complementation group C. This is the rarest form of the condition, affecting only a small number of individuals.The GPHN gene mutations involved in molybdenum cofactor deficiency likely reduce or eliminate the function of gephyrin. The known mutations impair gephyrin's ability to perform one or both of the final two steps of molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis. Without the cofactor, the metabolic enzymes that rely on it cannot function.The resulting loss of enzyme activity leads to buildup of certain chemicals, including sulfite, S-sulfocysteine, xanthine, and hypoxanthine, and low levels of another chemical called uric acid. (Testing for these chemicals can help in the diagnosis of this condition.) Sulfite, which is normally broken down by sulfite oxidase, is toxic, especially to the brain. Researchers suggest that damage caused by the abnormally high levels of sulfite (and possibly other chemicals) leads to encephalopathy, seizures, and the other features of molybdenum cofactor deficiency. "
589,GPI ,glucose-6-phosphate isomerase,"The GPI gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI). This enzyme has two distinct functions based on its structure. When two GPI molecules form a complex (a homodimer), the enzyme plays a role in a critical energy-producing process known as glycolysis, also called the glycolytic pathway. During glycolysis, the simple sugar glucose is broken down to produce energy. Specifically, GPI is involved in the second step of the glycolytic pathway; in this step, a molecule called glucose-6-phosphate is converted to another molecule called fructose-6-phosphate.When GPI remains a single molecule (a monomer) it is involved in the development and maintenance of nerve cells (neurons). In this context, it is often known as neuroleukin (NLK).The monomer is also produced by cancer cells and functions to promote spreading (metastasis) of the cancer; in this context it is called autocrine motility factor (AMF).","Glucose phosphate isomerase deficiency More than 30 GPI gene mutations have been identified in people with glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI) deficiency. GPI deficiency is an inherited disorder that affects red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues. People with this disorder have a condition known as chronic hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells are broken down (undergo hemolysis) prematurely, resulting in a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Some affected individuals also have neurological problems, including intellectual disability and difficulty with coordinating movements (ataxia).Most of the mutations that cause GPI deficiency replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the GPI enzyme. Some of these mutations may result in a less stable homodimer, impairing the activity of the enzyme in the glycolytic pathway. The resulting imbalance of molecules involved in the glycolytic pathway eventually impairs the ability of red cells to maintain their structure, leading to hemolysis.Other GPI gene mutations may cause the monomer to break down more easily, thereby interfering with its function in nerve cells. In addition, the shortage of monomers hinders homodimer formation, which impairs the glycolytic pathway. These mutations have been identified in individuals with GPI deficiency who have both hemolytic anemia and neurological problems. "
590,GPR101 ,G protein-coupled receptor 101,"The GPR101 gene provides instructions for making a type of protein called a G protein-coupled receptor. G protein-coupled receptors are embedded in the outer membrane of cells, where they relay chemical signals from outside the cell to the interior of the cell. However, the specific function of the GPR101 protein is unknown. The protein is found primarily in the brain, and studies suggest that it has a role in the pituitary gland. This gland, located at the base of the brain, produces hormones that control many important body functions. One of these hormones, called growth hormone, helps direct normal growth of the body's bones and tissues. The GPR101 protein is predominantly expressed in the pituitary gland during development before birth and again at adolescence, stages when the body grows the most. The protein is thought to be involved in the growth of cells in the pituitary gland, in the release of growth hormone from the gland, or in both processes.","X-linked acrogigantism Genetic changes involving the GPR101 gene cause a condition called X-linked acrogigantism (X-LAG), which is characterized by abnormally fast growth beginning in infancy or early childhood. Signs and symptoms of the condition result from enlargement (hyperplasia) of the gland or development of a noncancerous tumor in the gland (called a pituitary adenoma). The abnormal gland releases more growth hormone than normal, causing rapid growth in individuals with X-LAG.X-LAG occurs when a small amount of genetic material on the X chromosome is abnormally copied (duplicated). The duplication, often referred to as an Xq26.3 microduplication, occurs on the long (q) arm of the chromosome at a location designated q26.3. Although several genes can be duplicated, only an extra copy of the GPR101 gene is necessary to cause X-LAG. Duplication of the gene leads to an excess of GPR101 protein. It is unclear how extra GPR101 protein results in pituitary adenoma or hyperplasia or the release of excess growth hormone. "
591,GPR143 ,G protein-coupled receptor 143,"The GPR143 gene, also known as OA1, provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the coloring (pigmentation) of the eyes and skin. This protein is made in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina) and in skin cells. The GPR143 protein is part of a signaling pathway that controls the growth and maturation of melanosomes, which are cellular structures that produce and store a pigment called melanin. Melanin is the substance that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color. In the retina, this pigment also plays a critical role in normal vision.","Ocular albinism More than 60 GPR143 mutations have been identified in people with the most common form of ocular albinism, which is called the Nettleship-Falls type or type 1. Most mutations alter the size or shape of the GPR143 protein. These genetic changes often prevent the abnormal protein from ever reaching melanosomes, where it is needed to control the growth of these pigment-containing structures. In other cases, the GPR143 protein reaches melanosomes normally but mutations prevent the protein from interacting with other molecules in its signaling pathway. Without functional GPR143 protein, melanosomes in skin cells and the retina can grow abnormally large. It is unclear how these giant melanosomes (macromelanosomes) are related to vision loss and other eye abnormalities in people with ocular albinism.Most forms of albinism result from a reduced amount of melanin pigment within cells. Researchers continue to study why ocular albinism occurs when cells in the retina appear to contain a substantial amount of melanin. It is possible that this pigment is concentrated into a few abnormal macromelanosomes instead of being evenly distributed among many normal-sized melanosomes within the cell. Additional studies may help clarify the relationship between melanosomes, melanin distribution, and the reduced levels of pigmentation that are characteristic of ocular albinism. "
592,GRHPR ,glyoxylate and hydroxypyruvate reductase,"The GRHPR gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called glyoxylate and hydroxypyruvate reductase. This enzyme plays a role in preventing the buildup of a potentially harmful substance called glyoxylate by converting it to a substance called glycolate, which is easily excreted from the body. Additionally, this enzyme can convert a compound called hydroxypyruvate to D-glycerate, which is eventually converted to the simple sugar glucose (by other enzymes) and used for energy.","Primary hyperoxaluria More than 25 mutations in the GRHPR gene have been found to cause primary hyperoxaluria type 2. This condition is caused by the overproduction of a substance called oxalate. Excess amounts of this substance lead to kidney and bladder stones, which begin in childhood and often result in kidney disease by early adulthood. Deposition of oxalate in multiple other tissues throughout the body (systemic oxalosis) can cause additional health problems.GRHPR gene mutations either disrupt production of the glyoxylate and hydroxypyruvate reductase enzyme or alter its structure. As a result, enzyme activity is absent or severely reduced and the conversion of glyoxylate to glycolate is impaired. Glyoxylate builds up and is converted to a compound called oxalate. The oxalate is filtered through the kidneys and is either excreted in urine as a waste product or combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate, a hard compound that is the main component of kidney and bladder stones. Increased oxalate levels in the blood can lead to systemic oxalosis, particularly affecting bones and the walls of blood vessels in people with primary hyperoxaluria type 2. "
593,GRIN2A ,glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2A,"The GRIN2A gene provides instructions for making a protein called GluN2A (formerly known as NR2A). This protein is found in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and spinal cord, including regions of the brain involved in speech and language. The GluN2A protein is one component (subunit) of a subset of NMDA receptors. There are several types of NMDA receptors, made up of different combinations of protein components. NMDA receptors are glutamate-gated ion channels; when brain chemicals called glutamate and glycine attach to the receptor, a channel opens, allowing positively charged particles (cations) to flow through. The flow of cations generates currents that activate (excite) neurons to send signals in the brain. NMDA receptors are involved in normal brain development, changes in the brain in response to experience (synaptic plasticity), learning, and memory. They also appear to play a role during deep (slow-wave) sleep.The GluN2A subunit of NMDA receptors determines where in the brain the receptor is located and how it functions. It also provides the site to which glutamate binds.","Epilepsy-aphasia spectrum More than 50 mutations in the GRIN2A gene have been identified in some people with conditions that fall along the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum. This group of conditions is characterized by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, usually during slow-wave sleep; a loss of speech and language skills and sometimes other developmental skills; and in many cases, recurrent seizures (epilepsy). Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS) and epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep (ECSWS) are at the severe end of the spectrum, while childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (CECTS) is at the mild end. Several other conditions have signs and symptoms of intermediate severity.Many GRIN2A gene mutations lead to production of a nonfunctional GluN2A protein or prevent the production of any protein at all. These mutations likely lead to a reduced number of NMDA receptors containing the GluN2A subunit. Researchers suspect that, as a result, signaling occurs through other types of NMDA receptors that more easily excite neurons, leading to excessive signaling in the brain. Other mutations lead to production of abnormal GluN2A proteins that likely alter how the NMDA receptors function, possibly increasing signaling. Excessive activity of neurons in the brain can lead to seizures and other abnormal brain activity and may result in death of the neurons. Changes in GluN2A appear to specifically affect signaling in regions of the brain involved in speech and language and disrupt brain activity during slow-wave sleep, leading to several of the signs and symptoms of this group of conditions. It is not clear why some GRIN2A gene mutations lead to a relatively mild condition and others cause more severe signs and symptoms. "
594,GRIN2B ,glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2B,"The GRIN2B gene provides instructions for making a protein called GluN2B. This protein is found in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain, primarily during development before birth. The GluN2B protein is one component (subunit) of a subset of specialized protein structures called NMDA receptors. There are several types of NMDA receptors, made up of different combinations of proteins.NMDA receptors are glutamate-gated ion channels. When brain chemicals called glutamate and glycine attach to the receptor, a channel opens, allowing positively charged particles (cations) to flow through. The flow of cations activates (excites) neurons to send signals to each other. The cation flow also plays a role in the process by which the neurons mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation). NMDA receptors are involved in normal brain development, changes in the brain in response to experience (synaptic plasticity), learning, and memory.","GRIN2B-related neurodevelopmental disorder Several dozen mutations in the GRIN2B gene have been found to cause GRIN2B-related neurodevelopmental disorder, which is characterized by intellectual disability and delayed development of speech and motor skills. Other neurological problems that commonly occur in this disorder include seizures, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), movement disorders, and behavioral problems.Many GRIN2B gene mutations lead to production of a nonfunctional GluN2B protein or prevent the production of any GluN2B protein from one copy of the gene in each cell. A shortage of this protein may reduce the number of functional NMDA receptors, which would reduce receptor activity in cells. Other mutations lead to the production of abnormal GluN2B proteins that likely alter how the NMDA receptors function; some mutations reduce NMDA receptor signaling while others increase it. Researchers are unsure how abnormal activity of NMDA receptors prevents normal growth and development of the brain or why too much or too little activity lead to similar neurological problems in people with GRIN2B-related neurodevelopmental disorder. "
595,GRIP1 ,glutamate receptor interacting protein 1,"The GRIP1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is able to attach (bind) to other proteins and is important for moving (targeting) proteins to the correct location in cells. For example, the GRIP1 protein targets two proteins called FRAS1 and FREM2 to the correct region of the cell so that they can form a group of proteins known as the FRAS/FREM complex. This complex is found in the thin, sheet-like structures (basement membranes) that separate and support the cells of many tissues. The complex is particularly important during development before birth. One of its roles is to anchor the top layer of skin by connecting the basement membrane of the top layer to the layer of skin below. The FRAS/FREM complex is also involved in the proper development of certain other organs and tissues, including the kidneys, although the mechanism is unclear.In addition, the GRIP1 protein targets necessary proteins to the junctions (synapses) between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain where cell-to-cell communication occurs. GRIP1 may also be involved in the development of neurons.","Fraser syndrome At least two GRIP1 gene mutations have been found to cause Fraser syndrome; these mutations are involved in a small percentage of cases of this condition. Fraser syndrome affects development before birth and is characterized by eyes that are completely covered by skin (cryptophthalmos), fusion of the skin between the fingers and toes (cutaneous syndactyly), and abnormalities of the kidneys and other organs and tissues.GRIP1 gene mutations alter the genetic blueprint that carries the instructions for making GRIP1 protein. If any GRIP1 protein is made, it is likely unable to function. Without GRIP1, FRAS1 and FREM2 do not get to the correct location to form the FRAS/FREM complex. Lack of the FRAS/FREM complex in the basement membrane of skin leads to detachment of the top layer of skin, causing blisters to form during development. These blisters likely prevent the proper formation of certain structures before birth, leading to cryptophthalmos and cutaneous syndactyly. It is unknown how lack of the FRAS/FREM complex leads to kidney abnormalities and other problems in Fraser syndrome. "
596,GRM6 ,glutamate metabotropic receptor 6,"The GRM6 gene provides instructions for making a protein called metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 (mGluR6). This protein is a glutamate receptor, which is a type of protein that attaches (binds) to the signaling molecule glutamate on the surface of cells. The mGluR6 protein is found within the membrane that surrounds cells called bipolar cells, which are part of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). Bipolar cells receive visual signals from cells called rods that are used to see in low light. Rod cells release glutamate, which then binds to mGluR6 on bipolar cells. This binding ultimately triggers bipolar cells to transmit the visual signals to other retinal cells and eventually to the brain.","Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness At least 25 mutations in the GRM6 gene have been found to cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness, which is characterized by the inability to see in low light and other vision problems such as nearsightedness (myopia). Most GRM6 gene mutations impair the function of the mGluR6 protein by changing single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the protein. These mutations prevent the protein from reaching the cell membrane where it is needed to bind to glutamate. Without any mGluR6 protein at the cell surface, the glutamate released from rod cells in low light is not detected by bipolar cells, so visual signals are not transmitted. The brain does not receive the visual information sent by rods, leading to difficulty seeing in low light. "
597,GRN ,granulin precursor,"The GRN gene provides instructions for making a protein called granulin (also known as progranulin). This protein is found in tissues throughout the body. It is most active in cells that are dividing rapidly, such as skin cells and cells that line the gastrointestinal tract. Granulin helps regulate the growth, division, and survival of these cells. It also plays important roles in early embryonic development, regulation of the body's immune system response, and wound healing.Granulin is active in several types of brain cells, although much less is known about this protein's function in the brain. It appears to be critical for the survival of nerve cells (neurons).","GRN-related frontotemporal dementia More than 65 mutations in the GRN gene have been identified in people with GRN-related frontotemporal dementia. The most common mutation, which is written as Arg493Ter or R493X, creates a premature stop signal in the instructions for making granulin. Most of the mutations that cause GRN-related frontotemporal dementia prevent any protein from being produced from one copy of the GRN gene in each cell. As a result of these genetic changes, cells make only half the usual amount of granulin.It is unclear how a shortage of granulin leads to the features of GRN-related frontotemporal dementia. However, studies have shown that the disorder is characterized by the buildup of a protein called TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) in certain brain cells. The TDP-43 protein forms clumps (aggregates) that may interfere with cell functions and ultimately lead to cell death. Researchers are working to determine how mutations in the GRN gene, and the resulting loss of granulin, are related to a buildup of TDP-43 in the brain.The features of GRN-related frontotemporal dementia result from the gradual loss of neurons in regions near the front of the brain called the frontal and temporal lobes. The frontal lobes are involved in reasoning, planning, judgment, and problem-solving, while the temporal lobes help process hearing, speech, memory, and emotion. The death of neurons in these areas causes problems with many critical brain functions. However, it is unclear why the loss of neurons occurs in the frontal and temporal lobes more often than other brain regions in people with GRN-related frontotemporal dementia. "
598,GSN ,gelsolin,"The GSN gene provides instructions for making two forms of a protein called gelsolin. One form remains inside the cell (cellular gelsolin) and the other form is released from the cell (secreted gelsolin). Both forms of the gelsolin protein attach (bind) to another protein called actin. Actin proteins are organized into filaments, which form a network (the cytoskeleton) that gives structure to cells and allows them to change shape and move. Gelsolin helps assemble or disassemble actin filaments. It is thought that, through this function, the gelsolin protein regulates the formation of the actin cytoskeleton.","Lattice corneal dystrophy type II At least two mutations in the GSN gene cause lattice corneal dystrophy type II. This condition is characterized by the accumulation of protein clumps called amyloid deposits in many tissues throughout the body, including the clear, outer covering of the eye (the cornea); the skin; and the nerves. These protein clumps contain the gelsolin protein.GSN gene mutations that cause lattice corneal dystrophy type II change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the gelsolin protein: the amino acid aspartic acid at position 187. The most common mutation replaces the aspartic acid with the amino acid asparagine (written as Asp187Asn or D187N). Another mutation replaces the aspartic acid with the amino acid tyrosine (written as Asp187Tyr or D187Y).The amino acid change is found in both the cellular and secreted forms of the gelsolin protein. However, only the secreted form of the protein is involved in the amyloid deposits. The altered gelsolin protein is broken down differently than the normal protein, which results in an abnormal gelsolin protein fragment that is released from the cell. These protein fragments accumulate and form amyloid deposits. Amyloid deposits in the eyes, skin, and nerves lead to the signs and symptoms of lattice corneal dystrophy type II, such as vision impairment; paralysis of facial muscles; and thick, sagging skin. "
599,GSS ,glutathione synthetase,"The GSS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called glutathione synthetase. Glutathione synthetase participates in a process called the gamma-glutamyl cycle. The gamma-glutamyl cycle is a sequence of chemical reactions that takes place in most of the body's cells. These reactions are necessary for the production of glutathione, a small molecule made of three protein building blocks (amino acids). Glutathione protects cells from damage caused by unstable oxygen-containing molecules, which are byproducts of energy production. Glutathione is called an antioxidant because of its role in protecting cells from the damaging effects of these unstable molecules. Glutathione also helps process medications and cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens), and helps build DNA, proteins, and other important cellular components.","Glutathione synthetase deficiency More than 30 mutations in the GSS gene have been identified in people with glutathione synthetase deficiency. Characteristic features of this condition include the abnormal destruction of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia), the release of large amounts of a compound called 5-oxoproline in the urine (5-oxoprolinuria), and elevated acidity in the blood and tissues (metabolic acidosis). Severely affected individuals may also have neurological problems.Most of the GSS mutations involved in glutathione synthetase deficiency change single amino acids in glutathione synthetase. Other mutations disrupt how genetic information from the GSS gene is pieced together to make a blueprint for producing the enzyme. The altered glutathione synthetase enzyme may be unstable, shorter than usual, or the wrong shape. All of these changes reduce the activity of the enzyme and disrupt the gamma-glutamyl cycle, preventing adequate production of glutathione. Low levels of glutathione affect other chemical reactions in the body, leading to the overproduction of 5-oxoproline. Accumulation of this compound in red blood cells and other tissues causes hemolytic anemia and metabolic acidosis, and its release leads to 5-oxoprolinuria. "
600,GTF2H5 ,general transcription factor IIH subunit 5,"The GTF2H5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called p8 or TTDA. This protein is one part (subunit) of a group of related proteins known as the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex. The TFIIH complex has two major functions: it is involved in the process of gene transcription, which is the first step in protein production, and it helps repair damaged DNA.DNA can be damaged by ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun and by toxic chemicals, radiation, and unstable molecules called free radicals. DNA damage occurs frequently, but normal cells are usually able to fix it before it can cause problems. One of the major mechanisms that cells use to fix DNA is known as nucleotide excision repair (NER). As part of this repair mechanism, the TFIIH complex opens up the section of double-stranded DNA that surrounds the damage. The TTDA protein helps with this process by stabilizing the TFIIH complex and maintaining its structure. Once the damaged region has been exposed, other proteins snip out (excise) the abnormal section and replace the damaged area with the correct DNA.","Trichothiodystrophy At least three mutations in the GTF2H5 gene have been found to cause trichothiodystrophy. Mutations in this gene cause the photosensitive form of the condition, which is characterized by an extreme sensitivity to UV rays from sunlight.Each of the known GTF2H5 gene mutations results in the production of a nonfunctional version of the TTDA protein. A loss of this protein probably causes the TFIIH complex to become unstable, which greatly reduces the amount of this complex within cells. Without enough of the TFIIH complex, cells cannot effectively repair DNA damage caused by UV radiation. These problems with DNA repair cause people with the photosensitive form of trichothiodystrophy to be extremely sensitive to sunlight. It is unclear how a loss of the TTDA protein leads to the other features of the condition, such as slow growth, intellectual disability, and brittle hair. "
601,GTF2I ,general transcription factor IIi,"The GTF2I gene provides instructions for making two proteins, BAP-135 and TFII-I. BAP-135 is involved in normal immune system function. It is active in B cells, which are a specialized type of white blood cell that protects the body against infection. When a B cell senses a foreign substance (such as a virus), it triggers a series of chemical reactions that instruct the cell to mature, divide, and produce specific proteins called antibodies to fight the infection. The BAP-135 protein is activated as part of this series of chemical reactions; it transmits chemical signals that allow B cells to respond to potentially harmful invaders.TFII-I, the other protein produced from the GTF2I gene, binds to specific areas of DNA and helps regulate the activity of other genes. Based on this role, TFII-I is called a transcription factor. This protein is active in the brain and many other tissues in the body. Studies suggest that the TFII-I protein is involved in coordinating cell growth and division, and it may also play a role in controlling the flow of calcium into cells.","7q11.23 duplication syndrome The GTF2I gene is located in a region of chromosome 7 that is duplicated in people with 7q11.23 duplication syndrome. As a result of this duplication, people with 7q11.23 duplication syndrome have an extra copy of the GTF2I gene and several other genes in each cell. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome can cause a variety of neurological and behavioral problems as well as other abnormalities.Behavioral problems associated with 7q11.23 duplication syndrome include anxiety disorders (such as social phobias and selective mutism, which is an inability to speak in certain circumstances), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), physical aggression, excessively defiant behavior (oppositional disorder), and autistic behaviors that affect communication and social interaction. Studies suggest that an extra copy of the GTF2I gene may be associated with some of the behavioral features of 7q11.23 duplication syndrome, but the mechanism of this effect is unclear. Despite the role of the GTF2I gene in immune function, affected individuals do not appear to have immune abnormalities related to this disorder. "
602,GTF2IRD1 ,GTF2I repeat domain containing 1,"The GTF2IRD1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that regulates the activity of many other genes. This protein probably interacts with specific regions of DNA and with other proteins to turn genes on or off. Based on this role, the GTF2IRD1 protein is called a transcription factor.Although its exact function is unknown, the GTF2IRD1 gene is active in many of the body's tissues. It appears to be particularly important for gene regulation in the brain and in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). Studies suggest that this gene also plays a role in the development of tissues in the head and face (craniofacial development).","Williams syndrome The GTF2IRD1 gene is located in a region of chromosome 7 that is deleted in people with Williams syndrome. As a result of this deletion, people with this condition are missing one copy of the GTF2IRD1 gene in each cell. Studies suggest that the loss of this gene may contribute to some of the characteristic features of Williams syndrome, including the distinctive facial features, dental abnormalities, and problems with visual-spatial tasks such as writing and drawing. Researchers are investigating how a deletion of this gene may be related to these specific features. "
603,GUCY2D ,"guanylate cyclase 2D, retinal","The GUCY2D gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an essential role in normal vision. This protein is found in the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. Within the retina, the GUCY2D protein is located in light-detecting cells called photoreceptors. The retina contains two types of photoreceptor cells: rods and cones. Rods are needed for vision in low light, while cones are needed for vision in bright light, including color vision.The GUCY2D protein is involved in a process called phototransduction. When light enters the eye, it stimulates specialized pigments in photoreceptor cells. This stimulation triggers a series of chemical reactions that produce an electrical signal, which is interpreted by the brain as vision. Once photoreceptors have been stimulated by light, they must return to their resting (or ""dark"") state before they can be stimulated again. The GUCY2D protein is involved in a chemical reaction that helps return photoreceptors to their dark state after light exposure.","Cone-rod dystrophy At least 10 mutations in the GUCY2D gene have been identified in people with a vision disorder called cone-rod dystrophy. The problems associated with this condition include a loss of visual sharpness (acuity), an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), and impaired color vision. These vision problems worsen over time.The mutations that cause cone-rod dystrophy occur in one of the two copies of the GUCY2D gene in each cell. These mutations are responsible for about one-quarter of the cases of a form of the condition called autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy. Most of these mutations affect a particular protein building block (amino acid) in the GUCY2D protein, replacing the amino acid arginine at position 838 with one of several other amino acids. These genetic changes impair normal phototransduction, causing the photoreceptor cells to deteriorate over time. The loss of these cells leads to the progressive vision problems characteristic of cone-rod dystrophy. "
604,GUSB ,glucuronidase beta,"The GUSB gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called beta-glucuronidase (β-glucuronidase). This enzyme is located in lysosomes, compartments within cells that digest and recycle different types of molecules. β-glucuronidase is involved in the breakdown of large molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are composed of sugar molecules that are linked together to form a long string. To break down these large molecules, individual sugars are removed one at a time from one end of the molecule. β-glucuronidase is involved in the break down of three types of GAGs: dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate. This enzyme removes a sugar called glucuronic acid when it is at the end of the GAG chain.","Mucopolysaccharidosis type VII At least 55 mutations in the GUSB gene have been found to cause mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS VII). Most of these mutations change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the gene. All of the mutations that cause MPS VII reduce or eliminate the function of β-glucuronidase.The shortage (deficiency) of β-glucuronidase leads to the accumulation of dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate within lysosomes in virtually all tissues and organs. The buildup of these GAGs increases the size of the lysosomes, which is why many tissues and organs are enlarged in MPS VII. Researchers believe that the accumulated GAGs may also interfere with the functions of other proteins inside the lysosomes and disrupt many normal functions of cells. "
605,GYS1 ,glycogen synthase 1,"The GYS1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called muscle glycogen synthase. Muscle glycogen synthase is produced in most cells but is most abundant in heart (cardiac) muscle and muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). Muscle glycogen synthase helps link together molecules of the simple sugar glucose to form the complex sugar glycogen, which is a major source of stored energy in the body. Most glucose that is taken in from food is stored as glycogen in muscle cells. During contractions of the cardiac muscle or rapid or sustained movement of skeletal muscle, glycogen stored in muscle cells is broken down to supply the cells with energy.","Glycogen storage disease type 0 At least four mutations in the GYS1 gene have been found to cause a form of glycogen storage disease type 0 (GSD 0) that affects cardiac and skeletal muscle. Most GYS1 gene mutations that cause this condition lead to a lack of functional muscle glycogen synthase, resulting in a complete absence of glycogen in muscle cells. Normally, glycogen is formed from the leftover glucose that is not immediately used by cells after glucose is consumed during meals. In people with GSD 0, who cannot form glycogen, the extra sugar is released by the body. As a result, people with muscle GSD 0 do not have any stored energy, which leads to muscle pain, weakness, or episodes of fainting following moderate physical activity. Since there is no glycogen in cardiac muscle, affected individuals are also at an increased risk of cardiac arrest and sudden death, particularly after physical activity. "
606,GYS2 ,glycogen synthase 2,"The GYS2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called liver glycogen synthase. Liver glycogen synthase is produced solely in liver cells, where it helps form the complex sugar glycogen by linking together molecules of the simple sugar glucose. Glucose that is taken in from food is stored in the body as glycogen, which is a major source of energy. Glycogen that is stored in the liver can be broken down rapidly when glucose is needed to maintain normal blood sugar levels between meals.","Glycogen storage disease type 0 Approximately 20 mutations in the GYS2 gene have been found to cause a form of glycogen storage disease type 0 (GSD 0) that affects the liver. Most GYS2 gene mutations that cause this condition lead to a lack of functional glycogen synthase, resulting in a complete absence of glycogen in liver cells. Normally, glycogen is formed from the leftover glucose that is not immediately used by cells after glucose is consumed during meals. In people with GSD 0, who cannot form glycogen, the extra glucose is released by the body. As a result, people with this condition have no stored energy during long periods without food (fasting). During these periods, affected individuals may develop low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and nausea as well as other signs and symptoms of GSD 0. "
607,H19 ,"H19, imprinted maternally expressed transcript","The H19 gene provides instructions for making a molecule called a noncoding RNA. (RNA is a chemical cousin of DNA.) Unlike many genes, the H19 gene does not contain instructions for making a protein. The function of the noncoding RNA produced from the gene is unknown, but researchers believe that it may act as a tumor suppressor, keeping cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way. The H19 gene is highly active in various tissues before birth and appears to play an important role in early development.People inherit one copy of most genes from their mother and one copy from their father. Both copies are typically active, or ""turned on,"" in cells. However, the activity of the H19 gene depends on which parent it was inherited from. Only the copy inherited from a person's mother (the maternally inherited copy) is active; the copy inherited from the father (the paternally inherited copy) is not active. This parent-specific difference in gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting.H19 is part of a cluster of genes on the short (p) arm of chromosome 11 that undergoes genomic imprinting. Another gene in this cluster, IGF2, is also involved in growth and development. A nearby region of DNA known as imprinting center 1 (IC1) or the H19 differentially methylated region (H19 DMR) controls the parent-specific genomic imprinting of both the H19 and IGF2 genes. The IC1 region undergoes a process called methylation, which is a chemical reaction that attaches small molecules called methyl groups to certain segments of DNA. Methylation, which occurs during the formation of an egg or sperm cell, is a way of marking or ""stamping"" the parent of origin. The IC1 region is normally methylated only on the paternally inherited copy of chromosome 11.","Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, a condition characterized by overgrowth and other signs and symptoms that affect many parts of the body, can result from changes that affect the IC1 region. In some people with this condition, the maternally inherited copy of the IC1 region is methylated along with the paternally inherited copy. Because the IC1 region controls the genomic imprinting of the H19 and IGF2 genes, this abnormality disrupts the regulation of both genes. Specifically, abnormal methylation of the IC1 region leads to a loss of H19 gene activity and increased IGF2 gene activity in many tissues. A loss of H19 gene activity, which normally restrains growth, and an increase in IGF2 gene activity, which promotes growth, together lead to overgrowth in people with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.In a few cases, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome has been caused by deletions of a small amount of DNA from the IC1 region. Like abnormal methylation, these deletions alter the activity of the H19 and IGF2 genes. "
608,HADH ,hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase,"The HADH gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase that is important for converting certain fats to energy. This enzyme is involved in a process called fatty acid oxidation, in which several enzymes work in a step-wise fashion to break down (metabolize) fats and convert them to energy. The role of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase is to metabolize groups of fats called medium-chain fatty acids and short-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids are found in foods such as milk and certain oils and are produced when larger fatty acids are metabolized.3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase functions in mitochondria, the energy-producing centers within cells. This enzyme is especially important for the normal functioning of the heart, liver, kidneys, muscles, and pancreas. The pancreas makes enzymes that help digest food, and it also produces insulin, which controls how much sugar is passed from the blood into cells for conversion to energy.3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase is essential in the process that converts medium-chain and short-chain fatty acids to ketones, the major source of energy used by the heart and muscles. During prolonged periods without food (fasting) or when energy demands are increased, ketones are also important for the liver and other tissues.","3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency At least three mutations in the HADH gene have been found to cause 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. These mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase enzyme. These changes probably alter the 3-dimensional shape of the enzyme, which impairs its normal function.With a shortage (deficiency) of functional 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, medium-chain and short-chain fatty acids are not metabolized properly. As a result, these fatty acids are not converted to energy, which can lead to signs and symptoms of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency such as lack of energy (lethargy) and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Medium-chain and short-chain fatty acids that are not broken down can build up in tissues and damage the liver, heart, and muscles, causing serious complications. "
609,HADHA ,hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase trifunctional multienzyme complex subunit alpha,"The HADHA gene provides instructions for making part of an enzyme complex called mitochondrial trifunctional protein. This enzyme complex functions in mitochondria, the energy-producing centers within cells. Mitochondrial trifunctional protein is made of eight parts (subunits). Four alpha subunits are produced from the HADHA gene, and four beta subunits are produced from the HADHB gene. As the name suggests, mitochondrial trifunctional protein contains three enzymes that each perform a different function. The alpha subunits contain two of the enzymes, known as long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and long-chain 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase. The beta subunits contain the third enzyme. These enzymes are essential for fatty acid oxidation, which is the multistep process that breaks down (metabolizes) fats and converts them to energy.Mitochondrial trifunctional protein is required to metabolize a group of fats called long-chain fatty acids. Long-chain fatty acids are found in foods such as milk and certain oils. These fatty acids are stored in the body's fat tissues. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods of fasting, fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.","Long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency Researchers have identified several HADHA gene mutations that cause long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiency. These mutations decrease the long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase enzyme activity of mitochondrial trifunctional protein. (The protein's other enzyme activities remain normal or nearly normal.) Many of the HADHA mutations change one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make the alpha subunit. The most common mutation replaces the amino acid glutamic acid with the amino acid glutamine at position 474 in the alpha subunit. This mutation is written as Glu474Gln or E474Q. The Glu474Gln mutation and other amino acid replacements probably alter the structure of the alpha subunit, preventing it from functioning normally. Other HADHA mutations result in an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the alpha subunit.With a shortage (deficiency) of functional alpha subunits, long-chain fatty acids cannot be metabolized and processed. As a result, these fatty acids are not converted to energy, which can lead to some features of LCHAD deficiency, such as lack of energy (lethargy) and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Long-chain fatty acids or partially metabolized fatty acids may also build up and damage the liver, heart, muscles, and light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). This abnormal buildup causes the other signs and symptoms of LCHAD deficiency. "
610,HADHB ,hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase trifunctional multienzyme complex subunit beta,"The HADHB gene provides instructions for making part of an enzyme complex called mitochondrial trifunctional protein. This enzyme complex functions in mitochondria, the energy-producing centers within cells. Mitochondrial trifunctional protein is made of eight parts (subunits). Four alpha subunits are produced from the HADHA gene, and four beta subunits are produced from the HADHB gene. As the name suggests, mitochondrial trifunctional protein contains three enzymes that each perform a different function. The beta subunits contain one of the enzymes, known as long-chain 3-keto-acyl-CoA thiolase. The alpha subunits contain the other two enzymes. These enzymes are essential for fatty acid oxidation, which is the multistep process that breaks down (metabolizes) fats and converts them to energy.Mitochondrial trifunctional protein is required to metabolize a group of fats called long-chain fatty acids. Long-chain fatty acids are found in foods such as milk and certain oils. These fatty acids are stored in the body's fat tissues. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods of fasting, fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.","Mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency Researchers have identified at least 26 mutations in the HADHB gene that cause mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency. These mutations reduce all three enzyme activities of mitochondrial trifunctional protein. Most mutations change one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make the beta subunit. A change in amino acids probably alters the subunit's structure, which disrupts all three activities of the enzyme complex. Some mutations produce abnormally short, nonfunctional beta subunits and lead to decreased levels of mitochondrial trifunctional protein.With a loss of mitochondrial trifunctional protein activity, long-chain fatty acids cannot be metabolized and processed. As a result, these fatty acids are not converted to energy, which can lead to some features of this disorder, such as a lack of energy (lethargy) and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Long-chain fatty acids or partially metabolized fatty acids may also build up and damage the liver, heart, and muscles. This abnormal buildup causes the other signs and symptoms of mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency. "
611,HAL ,histidine ammonia-lyase,"The HAL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called histidase. Histidase breaks down the amino acid histidine, a building block of most proteins. Histidase is active (expressed) primarily in the liver and the skin. This enzyme breaks down histidine to a molecule called urocanic acid. In the liver, urocanic acid is broken down to form another amino acid called glutamic acid. In the skin, urocanic acid is involved in the response to ultraviolet (UV) light.","Histidinemia At least four mutations in the HAL gene have been found to cause histidinemia. All of these mutations change single amino acids in the histidase enzyme. These mutations are thought to decrease or eliminate enzyme activity, resulting in an inability to break down histidine. Histidine that is not broken down accumulates in the blood, but it typically causes no health problems. "
612,HAMP ,hepcidin antimicrobial peptide,"The HAMP gene provides instructions for the production of a protein called hepcidin. Hepcidin, which is produced primarily in the liver, plays a major role in maintaining iron balance in the body. When blood iron levels are high, iron enters liver cells and triggers them to increase production of hepcidin. Hepcidin then circulates in the blood and stops iron absorption in the small intestine when the body's supply of iron is too high.Hepcidin interacts primarily with other proteins in the small intestine, liver, and certain white blood cells to adjust iron absorption and storage. In this way, an appropriate balance of iron (iron homeostasis) is maintained and iron absorption is adjusted to reflect the body's needs.","Hereditary hemochromatosis At least 14 mutations in the HAMP gene can cause type 2 hemochromatosis, a form of hereditary hemochromatosis that begins during childhood or adolescence. Hereditary hemochromatosis is a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet. The excess iron accumulates in, and eventually damages, the body's tissues and organs.Mutations in the HAMP gene result in the production of abnormal hepcidin with decreased function. This altered hepcidin cannot stop iron absorption, even when the body has sufficient supplies of iron. As a result, tissues and organs become overloaded with iron, especially the liver and the heart, leading to organ damage in hereditary hemochromatosis. "
613,HARS2 ,"histidyl-tRNA synthetase 2, mitochondrial","The HARS2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called mitochondrial histidyl-tRNA synthetase. This enzyme is important in the production (synthesis) of proteins in cellular structures called mitochondria, the energy-producing centers in cells. While most protein synthesis occurs in the fluid surrounding the nucleus (cytoplasm), some proteins are synthesized in the mitochondria.During protein synthesis, in either the mitochondria or the cytoplasm, a type of RNA called transfer RNA (tRNA) helps assemble protein building blocks (amino acids) into a chain that forms the protein. Each tRNA carries a specific amino acid to the growing chain. Enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, including mitochondrial histidyl-tRNA synthetase, attach a particular amino acid to a specific tRNA. Mitochondrial histidyl-tRNA synthetase attaches the amino acid histidine to the correct tRNA, which helps ensure that histidine is added at the proper place in the mitochondrial protein.","Perrault syndrome At least two mutations in the HARS2 gene have been found to cause Perrault syndrome. This rare condition is characterized by hearing loss in males and females with the disorder and abnormalities of the ovaries in affected females. The HARS2 gene mutations involved in Perrault syndrome reduce the activity of mitochondrial histidyl-tRNA synthetase. A shortage of functional mitochondrial histidyl-tRNA synthetase prevents the normal assembly of new proteins within mitochondria. Researchers speculate that impaired protein assembly disrupts mitochondrial energy production. However, it is unclear exactly how HARS2 gene mutations lead to hearing problems and ovarian abnormalities in affected individuals. "
614,HAX1 ,HCLS1 associated protein X-1,"The HAX1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called HS-1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1). This protein is involved in the regulation of apoptosis, which is the process by which cells self-destruct when they are damaged or no longer needed. Apoptosis is a common process that occurs throughout life. The HAX-1 protein is also thought to be involved in cell movement (migration). The HAX-1 protein is found primarily in the mitochondria, the energy-producing centers within cells.Different versions of the HAX-1 protein can be produced from the HAX1 gene by a mechanism called alternative splicing. This mechanism produces different version of the protein by cutting and rearranging the genetic instructions in different ways. The purpose of these multiple versions of the HAX-1 protein is unclear.","Severe congenital neutropenia At least 10 mutations in the HAX1 gene have been found to cause severe congenital neutropenia, a condition characterized by a shortage (deficiency) of neutrophils. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that play a role in inflammation and in fighting infection. Most of the mutations that cause severe congenital neutropenia change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the HAX-1 protein. HAX1 gene mutations that cause severe congenital neutropenia result in the production of a nonfunctional HAX-1 protein. A lack of functional HAX-1 protein disrupts regulation of apoptosis, leading to the premature death of neutrophils. A deficiency of neutrophils results in recurrent infections, episodes of inflammation, and other immune problems in people with severe congenital neutropenia.People with certain HAX1 gene mutations have neurological problems such as seizures and developmental delay in addition to severe congenital neutropenia. These mutations disrupt two of the alternatively spliced versions of the HAX-1 protein. The gene mutations that lead to severe congenital neutropenia alone disrupt only one version of the HAX-1 protein. It is unclear how nonfunctional HAX-1 proteins cause neurological features seen in some affected individuals. "
615,HBA1 ,hemoglobin subunit alpha 1,"The HBA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called alpha-globin. This protein is also produced from a nearly identical gene called HBA2. These two alpha-globin genes are located close together in a region of chromosome 16 known as the alpha-globin locus.Alpha-globin is a component (subunit) of a larger protein called hemoglobin, which is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells and tissues throughout the body. Hemoglobin is made up of four subunits: two subunits of alpha-globin and two subunits of another type of globin. Alpha-globin is a component of both fetal hemoglobin, which is active only before birth and in the newborn period, and adult hemoglobin, which is active throughout the rest of life.Each of the four protein subunits of hemoglobin carries an iron-containing molecule called heme. Heme molecules are necessary for red blood cells to pick up oxygen in the lungs and deliver it to the body's tissues. A complete hemoglobin protein is capable of carrying four oxygen molecules at a time (one attached to each heme molecule). Oxygen attached to hemoglobin gives blood its bright red color.","Alpha thalassemia Deletions of the HBA1 and/or HBA2 genes are the most common cause of alpha thalassemia. Rarely, mutations in or near these genes can also be responsible for the disease. The signs and symptoms of alpha thalassemia tend to be more severe when the disease results from mutations in the alpha-globin genes than when it is caused by deletions of these genes.People have two copies of the HBA1 gene and two copies of the HBA2 gene in each cell. Each copy is called an allele. For each gene, one allele is inherited from a person's father, and the other is inherited from a person's mother. As a result, there are four alleles that produce alpha-globin. The different types of alpha thalassemia result from the loss of some or all of these alleles.Hb Bart syndrome, the most severe form of alpha thalassemia, results from the loss of all four alpha-globin alleles. This condition is characterized by a buildup of excess fluid in the body before birth (hydrops fetalis), a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). HbH disease, which is milder, is caused by a loss of three of the four alpha-globin alleles. HbH disease is characterized by mild to moderate anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice).In Hb Bart syndrome and HbH disease, a shortage of alpha-globin prevents cells from making normal hemoglobin. Instead, cells produce abnormal forms of hemoglobin called hemoglobin Bart (Hb Bart) or hemoglobin H (HbH). These abnormal hemoglobin molecules cannot effectively carry oxygen to the body's tissues. The substitution of Hb Bart or HbH for normal hemoglobin causes anemia and the other serious health problems associated with alpha thalassemia.Two additional variants of alpha thalassemia are related to a reduced amount of alpha-globin. Because cells still produce some normal hemoglobin, these variants tend to cause few or no health problems. A loss of two of the four alpha-globin alleles results in alpha thalassemia trait. People with alpha thalassemia trait may have unusually small, pale red blood cells and mild anemia. A loss of one alpha-globin allele is found in alpha thalassemia silent carriers. These individuals typically have no thalassemia-related signs or symptoms. "
616,HBA2 ,hemoglobin subunit alpha 2,"The HBA2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called alpha-globin. This protein is also produced from a nearly identical gene called HBA1.

These individuals typically have no thalassemia-related signs or symptoms. "
617,HBB ,hemoglobin subunit beta,"The HBB gene provides instructions for making a protein called beta-globin. Beta-globin is a component (subunit) of a larger protein called hemoglobin, which is located inside red blood cells. In adults, hemoglobin normally consists of four protein subunits: two subunits of beta-globin and two subunits of another protein called alpha-globin, which is produced from another gene called HBA. Each of these protein subunits is attached (bound) to an iron-containing molecule called heme; each heme contains an iron molecule in its center that can bind to one oxygen molecule. Hemoglobin within red blood cells binds to oxygen molecules in the lungs. These cells then travel through the bloodstream and deliver oxygen to tissues throughout the body.","Beta thalassemia Nearly 400 mutations in the HBB gene have been found to cause beta thalassemia. Most of the mutations involve a change in a single DNA building block (nucleotide) within or near the HBB gene. Other mutations insert or delete a small number of nucleotides in the HBB gene.HBB gene mutations that decrease beta-globin production result in a type of the condition called beta-plus (B+) thalassemia. Mutations that prevent cells from producing any beta-globin result in beta-zero (B0) thalassemia.Problems with the subunits that make up hemoglobin, including low levels of beta-globin, reduce or eliminate the production of this molecule. A lack of hemoglobin disrupts the normal development of red blood cells. A shortage of mature red blood cells can reduce the amount of oxygen that is delivered to tissues to below what is needed to satisfy the body's energy needs. A lack of oxygen in the body's tissues can lead to poor growth, organ damage, and other health problems associated with beta thalassemia. "
618,HCCS ,holocytochrome c synthase,"The HCCS gene carries instructions for producing an enzyme called holocytochrome c-type synthase. This enzyme is active in many tissues of the body and is found in the mitochondria, the energy-producing centers within cells.Within the mitochondria, the holocytochrome c-type synthase enzyme helps produce a molecule called cytochrome c. Specifically, holocytochrome c-type synthase is involved in a reaction that adds an iron-containing molecule called heme to make mature cytochrome c, also called holocytochrome c, from a precursor form called apocytochrome c.Cytochrome c is involved in a process called oxidative phosphorylation, by which mitochondria generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source. It also plays a role in the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).","Microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome At least three HCCS gene mutations have been identified in individuals with microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome. Deletions of genetic material that include the HCCS gene have also been identified in affected individuals. HCCS gene mutations result in a holocytochrome c-type synthase enzyme that cannot perform its function. A deletion of genetic material that includes the HCCS gene prevents the production of the enzyme from that copy of the gene. This loss of functional holocytochrome c-type synthase enzyme can damage cells by impairing their ability to generate energy. In addition, without sufficient holocytochrome c-type synthase enzyme, the damaged cells may not be able to undergo apoptosis. These cells may instead die in a process called necrosis that causes inflammation and damages neighboring cells. During early development this spreading cell damage may lead to the eye and skin abnormalities characteristic of microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome. "
619,HCFC1 ,host cell factor C1,"The HCFC1 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called HCF-1, that helps regulate the activity of other genes. HCF-1 interacts with proteins called transcription factors, which attach (bind) to specific regions of DNA and help control the activity of particular genes.A specific function of the HCF-1 protein is to control the activity of genes involved in the processing of vitamin B12 (also known as cobalamin), particularly the MMACHC gene. This gene plays a role in the conversion of vitamin B12 into one of two molecules, adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) or methylcobalamin (MeCbl). AdoCbl is required for the normal function of an enzyme known as methylmalonyl CoA mutase. This enzyme helps break down certain protein building blocks (amino acids), fats (lipids), and cholesterol. AdoCbl is called a cofactor because it helps methylmalonyl CoA mutase carry out its function. MeCbl is also a cofactor, but for an enzyme known as methionine synthase. This enzyme converts the amino acid homocysteine to another amino acid, methionine. The body uses methionine to make proteins and other important compounds.HCF-1 helps regulate genes that are important in other cellular processes, such as progression of cells through the step-by-step process it takes to replicate themselves (called the cell cycle). This protein also plays a role in the distribution of cells in developing tissues and organs, including the brain.","Methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria At least six HCFC1 gene mutations have been identified in individuals with methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria, cblX type, one form of a disorder that causes developmental delay, eye defects, neurological problems, and blood abnormalities. Individuals with this form also have severe abnormalities in the development of the skull and face (craniofacial abnormalities). These mutations occur in regions of the protein that help it to interact with other proteins. It is thought that changes in these regions prevent HCF-1 from interacting with transcription factors, which disrupts normal gene activity. Impairment of MMACHC gene activity, in particular, prevents normal processing and transport of vitamin B12, impeding production of both AdoCbl and MeCbl. Because both of these cofactors are missing, the enzymes that require them (methylmalonyl CoA mutase and methionine synthase) do not function normally. As a result, certain amino acids, lipids, and cholesterol are not broken down and homocysteine cannot be converted to methionine. This dual defect results in a buildup of toxic compounds as well as homocysteine, and a decrease in the production of methionine within the body. This combination of imbalances leads to the signs and symptoms of methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria. Neurological and developmental problems are especially severe in individuals with cblX type, in part due to disruption of the activity of other genes normally regulated by the HCF-1 protein. "
620,HCN4 ,hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide gated potassium channel 4,"The HCN4 gene provides instructions for making a channel that transports positively charged atoms (ions) into heart muscle cells. This channel is located primarily in the sino-atrial (SA) node, which is an area of specialized cells in the heart that functions as a natural pacemaker. The HCN4 channel allows potassium and sodium ions to flow into cells of the SA node. This ion flow is often called the ""pacemaker current"" because it generates electrical impulses that start each heartbeat and is involved in maintaining a regular heart rhythm.","Sick sinus syndrome At least five mutations in the HCN4 gene have been identified in people with sick sinus syndrome, a heart condition that affects the function of the SA node. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the HCN4 channel. In some cases, fewer of the altered channels reach the cell membrane, where they are needed to transport ions. In other cases, the channel is in the right place but has an abnormal structure that changes how ions flow through it. All of the mutations reduce the overall flow of ions into cells of the SA node, preventing it from creating the electrical signals that control the heartbeat. These changes increase the risk of an abnormally slow heartbeat (bradycardia), which can cause dizziness, light-headedness, fainting (syncope), and related symptoms. HCN4 gene mutations have also been found in people who have a slow heartbeat without any other symptoms (asymptomatic bradycardia). "
621,HDAC4 ,histone deacetylase 4,"The HDAC4 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called histone deacetylase 4. This enzyme is part of a group of related enzymes, called histone deacetylases, that modify proteins called histones. Histones are structural proteins that attach (bind) to DNA and give chromosomes their shape.By removing a molecule called an acetyl group from histones (a process called deacetylation), histone deacetylases cause the DNA within chromosomes to become tightly packed (compressed). As a result, proteins called transcription factors, which attach (bind) to specific regions of DNA and help control the activity of particular genes, cannot access the DNA. Through deacetylation of histones, histone deacetylase 4 is able to control (regulate) the activity of certain genes.Histone deacetylase 4 appears to be particularly important for regulating the activity of genes involved in heart and skeletal development. This protein is also involved in nerve cell survival.","2q37 deletion syndrome 2q37 deletion syndrome is caused by deletions of genetic material near the end of the long (q) arm of chromosome 2, at a location designated 2q37. The signs and symptoms of 2q37 deletion syndrome vary widely, but affected individuals generally have intellectual disability, behavioral problems, obesity, and skeletal abnormalities that often include unusually short fingers and toes (brachydactyly).The chromosomal region that is deleted in 2q37 deletion syndrome varies among affected individuals and can contain many genes, but it always includes the HDAC4 gene. As a result of the deletion, people with this condition have only one copy of the HDAC4 gene in each cell instead of the usual two copies. Researchers believe that deletion of the HDAC4 gene, and a reduction in the amount of histone deacetylase 4 produced, accounts for many of the features of 2q37 deletion syndrome. A shortage of histone deacetylase 4 enzyme likely disrupts the regulation of many genes and contributes to intellectual disability, behavioral problems, skeletal abnormalities, and other features of 2q37 deletion syndrome.Some people with a mutation in only the HDAC4 gene have brachydactyly with no other health problems, while others have many features of 2q37 deletion syndrome. Researchers are studying why mutations in this gene can lead to a wide variety of signs and symptoms and what role the other genes on 2q37 play in the disorder. "
622,HDAC8 ,histone deacetylase 8,"The HDAC8 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called histone deacetylase 8. This enzyme is involved in regulating the structure and organization of chromosomes during cell division.Before cells divide, they must copy all of their chromosomes. The copied DNA from each chromosome is arranged into two identical structures called sister chromatids. Sister chromatids are attached to one another during the early stages of cell division by a group of proteins called the cohesin complex. Later in cell division, the cohesin complex must be removed so the sister chromatids can separate, allowing one from each pair to move into each newly forming cell. Histone deacetylase 8 carries out a chemical reaction that helps remove the cohesin complex so it can be recycled for future cell divisions.Researchers believe that histone deacetylase 8, as a regulator of the cohesin complex, also plays important roles in stabilizing cells' genetic information, repairing damaged DNA, and controlling the activity of certain genes that are essential for normal development.","Cornelia de Lange syndrome At least 28 mutations in the HDAC8 gene have been identified in people with Cornelia de Lange syndrome, a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body. Researchers estimate that mutations in this gene account for about 5 percent of all cases of this condition.Most HDAC8 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in histone deacetylase 8 or add or delete a small number of amino acids in the enzyme. All of these mutations appear to reduce or eliminate the enzyme's activity, which likely alters the activity of the cohesin complex and impairs its ability to regulate genes that are critical for normal development. Although researchers do not fully understand how these changes cause Cornelia de Lange syndrome, they suspect that altered gene regulation probably underlies many of the developmental problems characteristic of the condition.Studies suggest that mutations in the HDAC8 gene cause a somewhat different pattern of signs and symptoms than those associated with mutations in the NIPBL gene, which are the most common known cause of Cornelia de Lange syndrome. Affected individuals with HDAC8 gene mutations often have less severe growth problems, fewer abnormalities of the arms and hands, and different characteristic facial features than those with NIPBL gene mutations. They are more likely to have delayed closure of the ""soft spot"" on the head (the anterior fontanelle) in infancy, widely spaced eyes, and dental abnormalities. Like affected individuals with NIPBL gene mutations, those with HDAC8 gene mutations may have significant intellectual disability. "
623,HEPACAM ,hepatic and glial cell adhesion molecule,"The HEPACAM gene provides instructions for making a protein called GlialCAM. This protein is found in liver cells and certain brain cells known as glial cells. In liver cells, GlialCAM plays a role in the attachment of cells to one another (adhesion) and cell movement. In glial cells, GlialCAM attaches (binds) to other GlialCAM proteins or to other proteins called MLC1 and ClC-2. GlialCAM ensures that these proteins are transported to junctions that connect neighboring glial cells. The function of GlialCAM at the cell junction is unclear.","Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts At least 20 mutations in the HEPACAM gene have been found to cause megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts.This condition affects brain development and function, resulting in problems with movement and recurrent seizures. HEPACAM gene mutations lead to a protein that is unable to correctly transport proteins to the cell junction. It is unknown how a lack of functional GlialCAM protein (or certain other proteins) at neuronal cell junctions impairs brain development and function, causing the signs and symptoms of megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts.Mutations in the HEPACAM gene cause two types of megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts, type 2A and type 2B; together, these types account for 20 percent of all cases. A major difference between the two types is that the signs and symptoms of type 2B improve over time. The reasons for this improvement are unclear. "
624,HESX1 ,HESX homeobox 1,"The HESX1 gene provides instructions for producing a protein that regulates the activity of other genes. On the basis of this action, the HESX1 protein is called a transcription factor. The HESX1 gene is part of a family of homeobox genes, which act during early embryonic development to control the formation of many body structures.The HESX1 protein plays an important role in early brain development. In particular, it is essential for the formation of the pituitary, which is a gland at the base of the brain that produces several hormones. The HESX1 protein is also necessary for the development of structures at the front of the brain (the forebrain), including the nerves that carry visual information from the eyes to the brain (optic nerves).The HESX1 protein interacts with other proteins, including the protein produced from the PROP1 gene, during embryonic development. Both the HESX1 protein and the PROP1 protein bind to DNA and control the activity of other genes. The HESX1 protein turns off (represses) genes, while the PROP1 protein turns on (activates) genes. These proteins work together to coordinate the development of certain parts of the brain.",Combined pituitary hormone deficiency Genetics Home Reference provides information about combined pituitary hormone deficiency. 
625,HEXA ,hexosaminidase subunit alpha,"The HEXA gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of an enzyme called beta-hexosaminidase A. Specifically, the protein produced from the HEXA gene forms the alpha subunit of this enzyme. One alpha subunit joins with one beta subunit (produced from the HEXB gene) to form a functioning enzyme.Beta-hexosaminidase A plays a critical role in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). This enzyme is found in lysosomes, which are structures in cells that break down toxic substances and act as recycling centers. Within lysosomes, beta-hexosaminidase A forms part of a complex that breaks down a fatty substance called GM2 ganglioside.","Tay-Sachs disease More than 120 mutations that cause Tay-Sachs disease have been identified in the HEXA gene. These mutations reduce or eliminate the activity of the enzyme beta-hexosaminidase A, which prevents the enzyme from breaking down GM2 ganglioside. As a result, this substance builds up to toxic levels, particularly in nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Progressive damage caused by the buildup of GM2 ganglioside leads to the destruction of these cells, which causes the signs and symptoms of Tay-Sachs disease.Most of the known HEXA mutations result in a completely nonfunctional version of beta-hexosaminidase A. These mutations cause the severe form of Tay-Sachs disease, which appears in infancy. Other mutations reduce but do not eliminate the activity of beta-hexosaminidase A; these genetic changes are responsible for the less severe forms of Tay-Sachs disease, which appear later in life. "
626,HEXB ,hexosaminidase subunit beta,"The HEXB gene provides instructions for making a protein that is a part (subunit) of two related enzymes, beta-hexosaminidase A and beta-hexosaminidase B. Each of these enzymes is made up of two subunits. Beta-hexosaminidase A includes one alpha subunit (produced from the HEXA gene) and one beta subunit (produced from the HEXB gene). Beta-hexosaminidase B is composed of two beta subunits, which are produced from the HEXB gene.Beta-hexosaminidase A and beta-hexosaminidase B play a critical role in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). These enzymes are found in lysosomes, which are structures in cells that break down toxic substances and act as recycling centers. Within lysosomes, the enzymes break down fatty compounds called sphingolipids, complex sugars called oligosaccharides, and molecules that are linked to sugars (such as glycoproteins). In particular, beta-hexosaminidase A forms part of a complex that breaks down a fatty substance called GM2 ganglioside.","Sandhoff disease About 30 mutations that cause Sandhoff disease have been identified in the HEXB gene. These mutations reduce or eliminate the activity of both beta-hexosaminidase A and beta-hexosaminidase B. The malfunctioning or missing enzymes are unable to break down GM2 ganglioside and other molecules, which allows these compounds to accumulate within cells. Increased levels of GM2 ganglioside are particularly toxic to nerve cells in the central nervous system. Excess GM2 ganglioside leads to the progressive destruction of these cells, which causes many of the characteristic features of Sandhoff disease.Most of the known mutations in the HEXB gene cause the severe form of Sandhoff disease, which becomes apparent in infancy. These mutations prevent cells from making any beta-hexosaminidase A or beta-hexosaminidase B, or lead to the production of completely nonfunctional versions of these enzymes. The most common mutation deletes a large segment of DNA near the beginning of the HEXB gene, which results in a total loss of enzyme activity. Other mutations reduce but do not eliminate the activity of the enzymes; these genetic changes are responsible for the less severe forms of Sandhoff disease, which appear later in life. "
627,HFE ,homeostatic iron regulator,"The HFE gene provides instructions for producing a protein that is located on the surface of cells, primarily liver and intestinal cells. The HFE protein is also found on some immune system cells.The HFE protein interacts with other proteins on the cell surface to detect the amount of iron in the body. When the HFE protein is attached (bound) to a protein called transferrin receptor 1, the receptor cannot bind to a protein called transferrin. When transferrin receptor 1 is bound to transferrin, iron enters liver cells. So, it is likely that the HFE protein regulates iron levels in liver cells by preventing transferrin from binding to transferrin receptor 1.The HFE protein regulates the production of a protein called hepcidin. Hepcidin is produced by the liver, and it determines how much iron is absorbed from the diet and released from storage sites in the body. When the HFE protein is not bound to transferrin receptor 1, it binds to a group of other proteins that includes hepcidin. The formation of this protein complex triggers the production of hepcidin. So when the HFE protein is bound to transferrin receptor 1, hepcidin production is turned off and when the HFE protein is not bound to transferrin receptor 1, hepcidin production is turned on.When the proteins involved in iron sensing and absorption are functioning properly, iron absorption is tightly regulated. On average, the body absorbs about 10 percent of the iron obtained from the diet.","Hereditary hemochromatosis Researchers have identified more than 100 mutations in the HFE gene that cause type 1 hemochromatosis, a form of hereditary hemochromatosis that begins during adulthood. Hereditary hemochromatosis is a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet. The excess iron accumulates in, and eventually damages, the body's tissues and organs.Two particular mutations are responsible for most cases of type 1 hemochromatosis. Each of these mutations changes one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) in the HFE protein. One mutation replaces the amino acid cysteine with the amino acid tyrosine at position 282 in the protein's chain of amino acids (written as Cys282Tyr or C282Y). The other mutation replaces the amino acid histidine with the amino acid aspartic acid at position 63 (written as His63Asp or H63D).The Cys282Tyr mutation prevents the altered HFE protein from reaching the cell surface. The His63Asp mutation likely alters the three-dimensional shape of the protein. These mutations prevent the HFE protein from interacting with transferrin receptor 1 and other proteins. As a result, iron regulation is disrupted, and too much iron is absorbed from the diet. This increase in the absorption of dietary iron leads to the iron overload characteristic of type 1 hemochromatosis. "
628,HGD ,"homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase","The HGD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called homogentisate oxidase, which is active chiefly in the liver and kidneys. This enzyme participates in a step-wise process that breaks down two protein building blocks (amino acids), phenylalanine and tyrosine, when they are no longer needed or are present in excess. These two amino acids also play a role in making certain hormones, pigments, and brain chemicals called neurotransmitters.Homogentisate oxidase is responsible for a specific step in the breakdown of phenylalanine and tyrosine. Previous steps convert the two amino acids into a molecule called homogentisic acid. Homogentisate oxidase adds two oxygen atoms to homogentisic acid, converting it to another molecule called maleylacetoacetate. Other enzymes break down maleylacetoacetate into smaller molecules that are later used for energy or to make other products that can be used by the body.","Alkaptonuria More than 65 mutations in the HGD gene have been identified in people with alkaptonuria. Most of these mutations change single amino acids used to build the homogentisate oxidase enzyme. For example, a substitution of the amino acid valine for the amino acid methionine at protein position 368 (also written as Met368Val) is the most common HGD mutation in European populations.Mutations in the HGD gene inactivate homogentisate oxidase by changing its structure. Without a functional version of this enzyme, phenylalanine and tyrosine are not broken down properly and homogentisic acid builds up in the body. Excess homogentisic acid and related compounds are deposited in connective tissues such as cartilage and skin, which causes them to darken. Over time, a buildup of this substance in the joints leads to arthritis. Homogentisic acid is also excreted in urine, making the urine turn dark when exposed to air. "
629,HGSNAT ,heparan-alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase,"The HGSNAT gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called heparan-alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase (which is often shortened to N-acetyltransferase). This enzyme is located in lysosomes, compartments within cells that digest and recycle different types of molecules. N-acetyltransferase is involved in the step-wise breakdown (degradation) of large molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are composed of sugar molecules that are linked together to form a long string. To break down these large molecules, individual sugars are removed one at a time from one end of the molecule. N-acetyltransferase adds a molecule called an acetyl group to the sugar glucosamine in a subset of GAGs called heparan sulfate. This addition prepares the GAG for the next step in the degradation process.","Mucopolysaccharidosis type III At least 54 mutations in the HGSNAT gene have been found to cause mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIC (MPS IIIC). Most of these mutations change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the gene. All of the mutations that cause MPS IIIC reduce or eliminate the function of N-acetyltransferase.The lack of N-acetyltransferase activity disrupts the breakdown of heparan sulfate. As a result, partially broken down heparan sulfate accumulates within lysosomes. Researchers believe that the accumulation of GAGs interferes with the functions of other proteins inside the lysosomes and disrupts the normal functions of cells. It is unknown why the buildup of heparan sulfate mostly affects the central nervous system in MPS IIIC. "
630,HINT1 ,histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1,"The HINT1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1). The function of this protein is not clear. Laboratory studies show that the HINT1 protein has the ability to attach (bind) to certain types of molecules called nucleotides. HINT1 breaks down particular nucleotides through a process called hydrolysis. However, it is not known if the HINT1 protein performs the same reaction in the body or what effects it has.Although the mechanisms are not completely understood, the HINT1 protein is involved in the nervous system. In nerve cells (neurons), HINT1 binds to signaling proteins called receptors that relay signals affecting nervous system function. HINT1 appears to stabilize the interaction of different receptors and regulate the effects of their signaling.The HINT1 protein is also involved in programmed cell death (apoptosis), which occurs when cells are no longer needed. In addition, by blocking the activity of certain genes, HINT1 acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it keeps cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.","Autosomal recessive axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia At least nine mutations in the HINT1 gene have been found to cause autosomal recessive axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia. This neurological condition affects the peripheral nerves, which connect the brain and spinal cord to muscles and to sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch. People with this condition typically have muscle weakness in the feet, legs, and hands and delayed relaxation of muscles after tensing (neuromyotonia). Some affected individuals have mildly impaired sensations.The HINT1 gene mutations that cause this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the HINT1 protein. These changes reduce or eliminate the protein's ability to perform the hydrolysis reaction. Sometimes the altered protein is broken down prematurely. It is not clear how loss of functional HINT1 protein affects the peripheral nerves or leads to the signs and symptoms of this condition. "
631,HIVEP2 ,human immunodeficiency virus type I enhancer binding protein 2,"The HIVEP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that functions as a transcription factor. Transcription factors attach (bind) to specific regions of DNA and help control the activity (expression) of particular genes. The HIVEP2 protein is most abundant in the brain, where it controls the expression of multiple genes, many of which are involved in brain growth and development. This protein may also play a role in the function of immune system cells and the process of bone remodeling, in which old bone is broken down and new bone is created to replace it. It may also be involved in other body processes; however these additional roles are not completely understood.","HIVEP2-related intellectual disability At least nine mutations in the HIVEP2 gene have been found in individuals with a neurological disorder called HIVEP2-related intellectual disability. This condition is characterized by delayed development of speech and walking, moderate to severe intellectual disability, mild physical abnormalities (dysmorphic features), and weak muscle tone (hypotonia), among other features. The HIVEP2 gene mutations are thought to lead to a shortage of functional HIVEP2 protein. It is unclear how these genetic changes result in the features associated with HIVEP2-related intellectual disability, although researchers speculate that a shortage of the HIVEP2 protein alters the expression of several genes involved in brain growth and development. Abnormalities in the growth and development of the brain likely underlie the cognitive problems and other neurological features of HIVEP2-related intellectual disability. It is unclear how HIVEP2 gene mutations contribute to the unusual physical features and health problems that can occur with this condition. "
632,HJV ,hemojuvelin BMP co-receptor,"The HJV gene provides instructions for making a protein called hemojuvelin. This protein is made in the liver, heart, and muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). Hemojuvelin plays a role maintaining proper iron levels in the body by controlling the levels of another protein called hepcidin. Hepcidin is necessary for maintaining an appropriate balance of iron (iron homeostasis) in the body.","Hereditary hemochromatosis More than 30 HJV gene mutations have been found to cause type 2 hemochromatosis, a form of hereditary hemochromatosis that begins during childhood or adolescence. Hereditary hemochromatosis is a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet. The excess iron accumulates in, and eventually damages, the body's tissues and organs.Most HJV gene mutations change one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make hemojuvelin. Most frequently, the amino acid glycine is replaced by the amino acid valine at protein position 320 (written as Gly320Val or G320V). Other mutations create a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the hemojuvelin protein resulting in an abnormally small protein.Mutations in the HJV gene lead to an altered hemojuvelin protein that cannot function properly. Without adequate hemojuvelin, hepcidin levels are reduced and iron homeostasis is disturbed. As a result, too much iron is absorbed during digestion, which leads to iron overload and damage to tissues and organs in the body that is found in hereditary hemochromatosis. "
633,HLA-B ,"major histocompatibility complex, class I, B","The HLA-B gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the immune system. HLA-B is part of a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.HLA is the human version of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a gene family that occurs in many species. Genes in this complex are categorized into three basic groups: class I, class II, and class III. In humans, the HLA-B gene and two related genes, HLA-A and HLA-C, are the main genes in MHC class I.MHC class I genes provide instructions for making proteins that are present on the surface of almost all cells. On the cell surface, these proteins are bound to protein fragments (peptides) that have been exported from within the cell. MHC class I proteins display these peptides to the immune system. If the immune system recognizes the peptides as foreign (such as viral or bacterial peptides), it responds by triggering the infected cell to self-destruct.The HLA-B gene has many possible variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign invaders. Hundreds of versions (alleles) of the HLA-B gene are known, each of which is given a particular number (such as HLA-B27). Closely related alleles are categorized together; for example, more than 60 very similar alleles are subtypes of HLA-B27. These subtypes are designated as HLA-B*2701 to HLA-B*2763.","Ankylosing spondylitis Several variations of the HLA-B gene increase the risk of developing ankylosing spondylitis, particularly a version called HLA-B27. It is uncertain how this variation causes the increased risk. Researchers speculate that HLA-B27 may abnormally display peptides that trigger an immune reaction, resulting in the inflammatory process that causes arthritis. Other research suggests that the joint inflammation characteristic of this disorder may result from improper folding of the HLA-B27 protein or the presence of abnormal forms of the protein on the cell surface. Although many people with ankylosing spondylitis have the HLA-B27 variation, most people with this version of the HLA-B gene never develop the disorder. Additional genetic and environmental factors, many of which are unknown, affect the chances of developing ankylosing spondylitis and influence its progression. "
634,HLA-DPB1 ,"major histocompatibility complex, class II, DP beta 1","The HLA-DPB1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the immune system. The HLA-DPB1 gene is part of a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.The HLA complex is the human version of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a gene family that occurs in many species. The HLA-DPB1 gene belongs to a group of MHC genes called MHC class II. MHC class II genes provide instructions for making proteins that are present on the surface of certain immune system cells. These proteins attach to protein fragments (peptides) outside the cell. MHC class II proteins display these peptides to the immune system. If the immune system recognizes the peptides as foreign (such as viral or bacterial peptides), it triggers a response to attack the invading viruses or bacteria.The protein produced from the HLA-DPB1 gene attaches (binds) to the protein produced from another MHC class II gene, HLA-DPA1. Together, they form a functional protein complex called an antigen-binding DPαβ heterodimer. This complex displays foreign peptides to the immune system to trigger the body's immune response.Each MHC class II gene has many possible variations, allowing the immune system to react to a wide range of foreign invaders. Researchers have identified hundreds of different versions (alleles) of the HLA-DPB1 gene, each of which is given a particular number (such as HLA-DPB1*03:01).","Granulomatosis with polyangiitis At least one variant of the HLA-DPB1 gene has been associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). This condition occurs when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs (autoimmunity), causing inflammation that affects the lungs, airways, and kidneys. The associated variant, called HLA-DPB1*0401, has been found more frequently in people with GPA than in those who do not have the condition; this variant is thought to increase the risk of developing GPA.Because the HLA-DPB1 gene is involved in the immune system, changes in it might be related to the autoimmune response and inflammation that damage the lungs, kidneys, and other organs. However, it is unclear what specific role the HLA-DPB1 gene variant plays in development of this condition. It is likely that environmental factors trigger the condition in people who are genetically predisposed to it. Other genetic factors are also likely to be involved in GPA. "
635,HLA-DQA1 ,"major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ alpha 1","The HLA-DQA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the immune system. The HLA-DQA1 gene is part of a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.The HLA complex is the human version of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a gene family that occurs in many species. The HLA-DQA1 gene belongs to a group of MHC genes called MHC class II. MHC class II genes provide instructions for making proteins that are present on the surface of certain immune system cells. These proteins attach to protein fragments (peptides) outside the cell. MHC class II proteins display these peptides to the immune system. If the immune system recognizes the peptides as foreign (such as viral or bacterial peptides), it triggers a response to attack the invading viruses or bacteria.The protein produced from the HLA-DQA1 gene attaches (binds) to the protein produced from another MHC class II gene, HLA-DQB1. Together, they form a functional protein complex called an antigen-binding DQαβ heterodimer. This complex displays foreign peptides to the immune system to trigger the body's immune response.Each MHC class II gene has many possible variations, allowing the immune system to react to a wide range of foreign invaders. Researchers have identified hundreds of different versions (alleles) of the HLA-DQA1 gene, each of which is given a particular number (such as HLA-DQA1*05:01).","Celiac disease At least two specific combinations of HLA gene variants (HLA haplotypes) have been found to increase the risk of developing celiac disease, a disorder in which inflammation damages the intestinal tract and other organs and tissues. One of these haplotypes, known as DQ2, is composed of the protein produced from HLA-DQA1 gene variants known as HLA-DQA1*05:01 or HLA-DQA1*05:05 bound to the protein produced from HLA-DQB1 gene variants known as HLA-DQB1*02:01 or HLA-DQB1*02:02. The other haplotype, known as DQ8, is composed of the protein produced from HLA-DQA1 gene variants known as HLA-DQA1*03:01 or HLA-DQA1*03:02 bound to the protein produced from the HLA-DQB1 gene variant known as HLA-DQB1*03:02.The DQ2 and DQ8 haplotypes, which may occur separately or together, seem to increase the risk of an inappropriate immune response to the protein gluten, which is found in wheat, rye, and barley. This immune system malfunction results in the damage to the body's organs and tissues that occurs in celiac disease. However, the DQ2 and DQ8 haplotypes are also found in 30 percent of the general population, and only 3 percent of individuals with these haplotypes develop celiac disease. "
636,HLA-DQB1 ,"major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ beta 1","The HLA-DQB1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the immune system. The HLA-DQB1 gene is part of a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.The HLA complex is the human version of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a gene family that occurs in many species. The HLA-DQB1 gene belongs to a group of MHC genes called MHC class II. MHC class II genes provide instructions for making proteins that are present on the surface of certain immune system cells. These proteins attach to protein fragments (peptides) outside the cell. MHC class II proteins display these peptides to the immune system. If the immune system recognizes the peptides as foreign (such as viral or bacterial peptides), it triggers a response to attack the invading viruses or bacteria.The protein produced from the HLA-DQB1 gene attaches (binds) to the protein produced from another MHC class II gene, HLA-DQA1. Together, they form a functional protein complex called an antigen-binding DQαβ heterodimer. This complex displays foreign peptides to the immune system to trigger the body's immune response.Each MHC class II gene has many possible variations, allowing the immune system to react to a wide range of foreign invaders. Researchers have identified hundreds of different versions (alleles) of the HLA-DQB1 gene, each of which is given a particular number (such as HLA-DQB1*06:02).","Celiac disease At least two specific combinations of HLA gene variants (HLA haplotypes) have been found to increase the risk of developing celiac disease, a disorder in which inflammation damages the intestinal tract and other organs and tissues.

However, the DQ2 and DQ8 haplotypes are also found in 30 percent of the general population, and only 3 percent of individuals with the gene variants develop celiac disease. "
637,HLA-DRB1 ,"major histocompatibility complex, class II, DR beta 1","The HLA-DRB1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the immune system. The HLA-DRB1 gene is part of a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.The HLA complex is the human version of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a gene family that occurs in many species. The HLA-DRB1 gene belongs to a group of MHC genes called MHC class II. MHC class II genes provide instructions for making proteins that are present on the surface of certain immune system cells.

If the immune system recognizes the peptides as foreign (such as viral or bacterial peptides), it triggers a response to attack the invading viruses or bacteria.The protein produced from the HLA-DRB1 gene, called the beta chain, attaches (binds) to another protein called the alpha chain, which is produced from the HLA-DRA gene. Together, they form a functional protein complex called the HLA-DR antigen-binding heterodimer. This complex displays foreign peptides to the immune system to trigger the body's immune response.Each MHC class II gene has many possible variations, allowing the immune system to react to a wide range of foreign invaders. Researchers have identified hundreds of different versions (alleles) of the HLA-DRB1 gene, each of which is given a particular number (such as HLA-DRB1*04:01).",Alopecia areata Genetics Home Reference provides information about alopecia areata. 
638,HLCS ,holocarboxylase synthetase,"The HLCS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called holocarboxylase synthetase. This enzyme is important for the effective use of biotin, a B vitamin found in foods such as liver, egg yolks, and milk. In many of the body's tissues, holocarboxylase synthetase activates enzymes called biotin-dependent carboxylases by attaching biotin to them. These carboxylases are involved in many critical cellular functions, including the production and breakdown of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.Holocarboxylase synthetase may also play a role in regulating the activity of genes. In the nucleus, the enzyme likely attaches biotin molecules to histones, which are structural proteins that bind to DNA and give chromosomes their shape. Changing the shape of histones may help determine whether certain genes are turned on or off; however, it is not known how adding biotin affects gene regulation.","Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency About 30 mutations in the HLCS gene have been identified in people with holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency. Most of these mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the holocarboxylase synthetase enzyme. Many of the known mutations occur in a region of the enzyme that binds to biotin. These genetic changes reduce the enzyme's ability to attach biotin to carboxylases and histones. Without biotin, carboxylases remain inactive and are unable to process proteins, fats, and carbohydrates effectively. A lack of holocarboxylase synthetase activity may also alter the regulation of certain genes that are important for normal development. Researchers believe that these defects in enzyme function underlie the breathing problems, skin rashes, and other characteristic signs and symptoms of holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency. "
639,HMBS ,hydroxymethylbilane synthase,"The HMBS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme known as hydroxymethylbilane synthase. This enzyme is involved in the production of a molecule called heme. Heme is vital for all of the body's organs, although it is most abundant in the blood, bone marrow, and liver. Heme is an essential component of iron-containing proteins called hemoproteins, including hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in the blood).The production of heme is a multi-step process that requires eight different enzymes. Hydroxymethylbilane synthase is responsible for the third step in this process, which combines four molecules of porphobilinogen (the product of the second step) to form a compound called hydroxymethylbilane. In subsequent steps, five other enzymes produce and modify compounds that ultimately lead to heme.","Porphyria More than 300 mutations in the HMBS gene have been identified in people with a form of porphyria known as acute intermittent porphyria. Some of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in hydroxymethylbilane synthase. Other mutations add or delete genetic material within the HMBS gene, which alters the structure and function of the enzyme.Mutations in the HMBS gene reduce the activity of hydroxymethylbilane synthase, allowing compounds called porphyrins to build up in the liver and other organs. These compounds are formed during the normal process of heme production, but reduced activity of hydroxymethylbilane synthase allows them to accumulate to toxic levels. This buildup, in combination with nongenetic factors such as certain drugs, alcohol, smoking, and dieting, leads to attacks of severe abdominal pain and other symptoms in people with acute intermittent porphyria. "
640,HMGCL ,3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase,"The HMGCL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 3-hydroxymethyl-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (HMG-CoA lyase). This enzyme is found in mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers inside cells. HMG-CoA lyase plays a critical role in breaking down proteins and fats from the diet. Specifically, it is responsible for processing leucine, a protein building block (amino acid) that is part of many proteins. HMG-CoA lyase also produces ketones during the breakdown of fats. Ketones are compounds that certain organs and tissues, particularly the brain, use for energy when the simple sugar glucose is not available. For example, ketones are important sources of energy during periods of fasting.","3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency More than 25 mutations in the HMGCL gene have been identified in people with 3-hydroxymethyl-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency (also called HMG-CoA lyase deficiency). Most of these mutations change single amino acids in the HMG-CoA lyase enzyme. For example, the most common mutation in the Saudi Arabian population replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid glutamine at position 41 (written as Arg41Gln or R41Q). Other HMGCL mutations result in the production of an abnormally short enzyme that is missing critical segments.If a mutation reduces or eliminates the activity of HMG-CoA lyase, the body is unable to process leucine or make ketones properly. When leucine is not processed normally, chemical byproducts called organic acids can build up and make the blood too acidic (metabolic acidosis). A shortage of ketones can cause blood sugar levels to become dangerously low (hypoglycemia). The effects of metabolic acidosis and hypoglycemia can damage cells, particularly in the brain, resulting in serious illness in children with HMG-CoA lyase deficiency. "
641,HNF1B ,HNF1 homeobox B,"The HNF1B gene provides instructions for making a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and regulates the activity of other genes. On the basis of this role, the protein produced from the HNF1B gene is called a transcription factor. The HNF1B protein is part of a large group of transcription factors called homeodomain proteins. The homeodomain is a region of the protein that allows it to bind to DNA.The HNF1B protein is found in many organs and tissues, including the lungs, liver, intestines, pancreas, kidneys, reproductive system, and urinary tract. Researchers suspect that this protein may play a role in the development of many of these parts of the body.","17q12 deletion syndrome 17q12 deletion syndrome is a condition that results from the deletion of a small piece of chromosome 17 in each cell. Signs and symptoms of 17q12 deletion syndrome can include abnormalities of the kidneys (particularly fluid-filled sacs, called cysts, in the kidneys) and a form of diabetes called maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 (MODY5). The combination of kidney cysts and MODY5 is sometimes referred to as renal cysts and diabetes (RCAD) syndrome. Other features of 17q12 deletion syndrome include abnormalities of the urinary tract and reproductive system, delayed development, intellectual disability, and behavioral or psychiatric disorders. The health problems associated with 17q12 deletion syndrome vary widely, even among affected members of the same family.The part of chromosome 17 that is deleted is on the long (q) arm of the chromosome at a position designated q12. This region of the chromosome contains at least 15 genes, including HNF1B. A deletion of this region results in a loss of one copy of the HNF1B gene in each cell, leading to a reduced amount of HNF1B protein. A shortage of this protein likely disrupts the regulation of genes that are necessary for the normal development of several organs, including the kidneys and pancreas. Studies suggest that a loss of one copy of the HNF1B gene underlies the kidney and urinary tract abnormalities, as well as MODY5, in people with 17q12 deletion syndrome. "
642,HNRNPK ,heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K,"The HNRNPK gene provides instructions for making a protein called heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K). This protein attaches (binds) to DNA or its chemical cousin RNA and to other proteins. It acts as a docking site to bring together different molecules in the cell, which is important for relaying signals and controlling cellular functions. By bringing certain proteins together with DNA or RNA, the hnRNP K protein helps control the activity of genes and the production of proteins. By regulating gene activity and protein production, hnRNP K is involved in many cellular processes, including growth and division (proliferation) of cells, maturation of cells to take on specialized function (differentiation), and self-destruction (apoptosis) of cells when they are no longer needed.The hnRNP K protein plays a role in the normal development or function of many body systems. In the brain, the protein may be involved in a process called synaptic plasticity, which is the ability of the connections between neurons (synapses) to change and adapt over time in response to experience. This process is critical for learning and memory. Another process in the brain involving the hnRNP K protein is the growth of nerve cell extensions called axons, which are essential for transmission of nerve impulses. While the protein is likely critical in other systems and processes, its role is not well understood.","Au-Kline syndrome More than 20 mutations in the HNRNPK gene have been found to cause Au-Kline syndrome. This condition is characterized by weak muscle tone (hypotonia), intellectual disability, delayed development of speech and walking, and distinctive facial features. Other body systems, such as the heart, kidneys, and bones, may also be affected.The HNRNPK gene mutations that cause Au-Kline syndrome alter the blueprint for making hnRNP K protein, which results in the production of little or no hnRNP K protein from one copy of the gene. A shortage of this protein changes gene activity and protein production in cells. As a result, the normal development or function of cells, tissues, and organs in many parts of the body is disrupted, leading to the varied features of Au-Kline syndrome. In particular, problems with brain development likely contribute to intellectual disability, delayed development, and other neurological problems in people with the condition. "
643,HOGA1 ,4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase 1,"The HOGA1 gene provides instructions for making the 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase (HOGA) enzyme. This enzyme is found in liver and kidney cells, specifically within structures called mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers in cells. The HOGA enzyme is involved in breaking down a protein building block (amino acid) called hydroxyproline. Specifically, during the breakdown process, HOGA cuts (cleaves) a substance called 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate to produce two smaller substances called pyruvate and glyoxylate. In mitochondria, pyruvate is likely involved in energy production, but the function of glyoxylate is unclear.","Primary hyperoxaluria At least 24 mutations in the HOGA1 gene have been found to cause primary hyperoxaluria type 3. This condition is caused by the overproduction of a substance called oxalate. Excess amounts of this substance lead to kidney and bladder stones, which begin in early childhood and often result in blood in the urine (hematuria) and urinary tract infections. A specific mutation that alters the way the gene's instructions are used to make the enzyme (written as 700+5G>T) is present in about half of affected individuals. As a result of HOGA1 gene mutations, the HOGA enzyme cannot break down 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate, which leads to a buildup of this substance in the mitochondria of liver cells.It is unclear how an accumulation of 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate leads to an overproduction of oxalate in people with primary hyperoxaluria type 3. Some researchers think that the accumulation of 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate interferes with the activity of other enzymes, which lead to the accumulation of substances that get converted into oxalate. Other researchers think that excess 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate in mitochondria may leak out into liver cells. Enzymes within these cells would then convert 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate to glyoxylate, and then convert glyoxylate into oxalate. In individuals with primary hyperoxaluria type 3, the oxalate is filtered through the kidneys and is either excreted in urine as a waste product or combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate, a hard compound that is the main component of kidney and bladder stones. "
644,HOXA13 ,homeobox A13,"The HOXA13 gene provides instructions for producing a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and regulates the activity of other genes. On the basis of this role, the HOXA13 gene is called a transcription factor. The HOXA13 gene is part of a larger family of transcription factors called homeobox genes, which act during early embryonic development to control the formation of many body structures. Specifically, the HOXA13 protein appears to be critical for the formation and development of the limbs (particularly the hands and feet), urinary tract, and reproductive system.The HOXA13 gene contains three areas where a protein building block (amino acid) called alanine is repeated multiple times. These stretches of alanines are known as polyalanine tracts or poly(A) tracts. The role of polyalanine tracts in normal HOXA13 function is unknown.","Hand-foot-genital syndrome At least 14 mutations in the HOXA13 gene have been found to cause hand-foot-genital syndrome. More than half of these mutations affect one of the polyalanine tracts in the HOXA13 gene. These mutations add extra alanines to these tracts, making them abnormally long and unstable. The resulting altered protein is degraded by the cell, so it is unavailable to regulate the activity of other genes during early development. These changes affect the development of the hands, feet, urinary tract, and reproductive system.Other HOXA13 mutations result in the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the HOXA13 protein or change single amino acids in the protein. Mutations that substitute one amino acid for another amino acid may change the way the HOXA13 protein is folded. The altered protein may or may not function or bind to DNA normally. Mutations that result in an altered but functional HOXA13 protein may cause more severe signs and symptoms of hand-foot-genital syndrome than mutations that lead to a nonfunctional version of this protein. "
645,HOXB13 ,homeobox B13,"The HOXB13 gene provides instructions for producing a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and regulates the activity of other genes. On the basis of this role, the protein produced from the HOXB13 gene is called a transcription factor. The HOXB13 protein is part of a large group of transcription factors called the homeobox protein family. The HOXB13 protein is thought to play a role in the development and maintenance of the skin. It also acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it keeps cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way.The HOXB13 protein has a characteristic homeobox region called the homeodomain, which binds to DNA, and two other regions called MEIS interacting domains. The MEIS interacting domains are thought to help regulate the activity of the HOXB13 protein by controlling the binding of the homeodomain with DNA.","Prostate cancer At least two mutations in the HOXB13 gene have been associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer; the disease may also be more aggressive in affected men with a HOXB13 mutation. These mutations are present in every cell of the body and can be passed from one generation to the next. As a result, they are associated with cancers that cluster in families. However, not everyone who inherits a mutation in the HOXB13 gene will ultimately develop prostate cancer. Other genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors also contribute to a person's cancer risk.The HOXB13 gene mutations that are associated with prostate cancer alter the MEIS interacting domains of the HOXB13 protein. Researchers suggest that the changes may impair the ability of these domains to regulate the HOXB13 protein's interactions with DNA. As a result, the protein's tumor suppressor function is impaired, resulting in the uncontrolled cell proliferation that can lead to prostate cancer. "
646,HPD ,4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase,"The HPD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase. This enzyme is abundant in the liver, and smaller amounts are found in the kidneys. It is second in a series of five enzymes that work to break down the amino acid tyrosine, a protein building block found in many foods. Specifically, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase converts a tyrosine byproduct called 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to homogentisic acid. Continuing the process, homogentisic acid is further broken down and ultimately smaller molecules are produced that are either excreted by the kidneys or used to produce energy or make other substances in the body.","Tyrosinemia Researchers have identified at least six HPD gene mutations that cause tyrosinemia type III. This condition is characterized by neurological problems such as intellectual disability, seizures, and periodic loss of balance and coordination (intermittent ataxia). Some of the mutations that cause this condition change single amino acids in the 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase enzyme. Other mutations lead to the production of an unusually small enzyme. As a result of these mutations, the activity of the 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase enzyme is unusually low or absent. As a result, the enzyme cannot perform its role in the breakdown of tyrosine, so 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate is converted to toxic compounds instead of homogentisic acid. As these toxic compounds builds up in cells, they can impair function and eventually cause cell death. Cells in the nervous system are particularly sensitive to this toxic accumulation. Nerve cell damage and death likely lead to the characteristic features of tyrosinemia type III. "
647,HPRT1 ,hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1,"The HPRT1 gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1. This enzyme allows cells to recycle purines, a type of building block of DNA and its chemical cousin RNA. Manufacturing purines uses more energy and takes more time than recycling purines, which makes recycling these molecules more efficient. Recycling purines ensures that cells have a plentiful supply of building blocks for the production of DNA and RNA. The process of recycling purines is also known as the purine salvage pathway.","Lesch-Nyhan syndrome More than 200 mutations in the HPRT1 gene have been found to cause Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. These mutations include changes in single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) or insertions or deletions of small amounts of DNA within the gene. These changes result in either nonfunctional or very low-function hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1. Under these conditions, uric acid, a waste product of purine breakdown, accumulates in the body and can cause gouty arthritis (arthritis caused by uric acid in the joints), kidney stones, and bladder stones. It is unclear how this enzyme deficiency causes the neurological and behavioral problems characteristic of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. "
648,HPS1 ,"HPS1, biogenesis of lysosomal organelles complex 3 subunit 1","The HPS1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms part of a complex called biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-3 (BLOC-3). This complex plays a role in the formation of a group of cellular structures called lysosome-related organelles (LROs). In particular, BLOC-3 helps turn on the process by which necessary proteins are transported to LROs during their formation. LROs are very similar to compartments within the cell called lysosomes, which digest and recycle materials. However, LROs perform specialized functions and are found only in certain cell types.Within pigment-producing cells (melanocytes), LROs called melanosomes produce and distribute melanin, which is the substance that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color. A different type of LRO is found in platelets, the blood cells involved in normal blood clotting. These LROs, called dense granules, release chemical signals that cause platelets to stick together and form a blood clot. LROs are also found in other specialized cells, including certain cells of the lungs.","Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome At least 31 mutations in the HPS1 gene have been found to cause Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 1. Individuals with this form of the condition typically have oculocutaneous albinism, a condition characterized by fair skin, light-colored hair and eyes, and poor vision. They may also have bleeding problems and a severe lung disease called pulmonary fibrosis. The HPS1 gene mutations that cause Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 1 impair the normal function of BLOC-3, disrupting the size, structure, and function of LROs in cells throughout the body. The most common mutation causes a duplication of genetic material within the HPS1 gene and is found in people from northwest Puerto Rico. Specifically, this mutation results in an extra 16 DNA building blocks (nucleotides) within the gene (written as 1470_1486dup16).Because the abnormal melanosomes do not distribute melanin properly, people with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome have unusually light coloring of the skin, hair, and eyes. The absence of dense granules within platelets leads to bleeding problems in affected individuals. Pulmonary fibrosis may also develop due to abnormal LROs in certain lung cells. "
649,HPS3 ,"HPS3, biogenesis of lysosomal organelles complex 2 subunit 1","The HPS3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms part of a complex called biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-2 (BLOC-2). This complex plays a role in the formation of a group of cellular structures called lysosome-related organelles (LROs). In particular, BLOC-2 controls the sorting and transport of proteins into LROs during their formation. LROs are very similar to compartments within the cell called lysosomes, which digest and recycle materials. However, LROs perform specialized functions and are found only in certain cell types.Within pigment-producing cells (melanocytes), LROs called melanosomes produce and distribute melanin, which is the substance that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color. A different type of LRO is found in platelets, the blood cells involved in normal blood clotting. These LROs, called dense granules, release chemical signals that cause platelets to stick together and form a blood clot.","Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome At least 7 mutations in the HPS3 gene have been found to cause Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 3, which is a mild form of the condition. Affected individuals typically have oculocutaneous albinism, a condition characterized by fair skin, light-colored hair and eyes, and poor vision. They may also have bleeding problems. The HPS3 gene mutations that cause Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 3 impair the normal function of BLOC-2, disrupting the size, structure, and function of LROs in cells throughout the body.One common mutation results in a deletion of genetic material within the HPS3 gene. This deletion includes approximately 3,900 DNA building blocks (nucleotides) and is known as the 3.9kb deletion. It is also written as 339_4260del3904. This mutation, which is found in affected individuals from the central region of Puerto Rico, prevents the production of any HPS3 protein.Another mutation in the HPS3 gene has been found in people with Central and Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish background. This mutation, called a splice-site mutation, disrupts the way the gene's instructions are used to make the protein. This mutation, which is written as 1163+1G>A, results in an abnormally short protein.Because the abnormal melanosomes do not distribute melanin properly, people with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome have unusually light coloring of the skin, hair, and eyes (oculocutaneous albinism). The absence of dense granules within platelets leads to bleeding problems in affected individuals. "
650,HPSE2 ,heparanase 2 (inactive),"The HPSE2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called heparanase 2. Little is known about this protein, but its structure is similar to that of another protein called heparanase 1. Heparanase 1 is an enzyme that splits (cleaves) molecules called heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) by removing the heparan sulfate portion (the side chain).HSPGs are important parts of the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell (extracellular matrix) and of basement membranes, which are thin, sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues. Cleavage of HSPGs by heparanase 1 may lead to changes in the basement membrane or extracellular matrix that allow cell movement or release of substances from the cell. The specific function of the heparanase 2 enzyme is not well understood, but studies suggest that it may block the action of heparanase 1.",Migraine Genetics Home Reference provides information about migraine. 
651,HRAS ,"HRas proto-oncogene, GTPase","The HRAS gene provides instructions for making a protein called H-Ras that is involved primarily in regulating cell division. Through a process known as signal transduction, the H-Ras protein relays signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. These signals instruct the cell to grow or divide. The H-Ras protein is a GTPase, which means it converts a molecule called GTP into another molecule called GDP. The H-Ras protein acts like a switch, and it is turned on and off by GTP and GDP molecules. To transmit signals, the protein must be turned on by attaching (binding) to a molecule of GTP. The H-Ras protein is turned off (inactivated) when it converts GTP to GDP. When the protein is bound to GDP, it does not relay signals to the cell's nucleus.The HRAS gene belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous. The HRAS gene is in the Ras family of oncogenes, which also includes two other genes: KRAS and NRAS. The proteins produced from these three genes are GTPases. These proteins play important roles in cell division, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (cell differentiation), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).","Costello syndrome At least 15 mutations in the HRAS gene have been identified in people with Costello syndrome, a rare condition that affects many parts of the body and increases the risk of developing cancerous and noncancerous tumors. The mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in a critical region of the H-Ras protein. The most common mutation accounts for more than 80 percent of all cases of Costello syndrome; it replaces the amino acid glycine with the amino acid serine at protein position 12 (written as Gly12Ser or G12S).The HRAS gene mutations that cause Costello syndrome lead to the production of an H-Ras protein that is abnormally turned on (active) in cells throughout the body. Instead of triggering cell growth in response to signals from outside the cell, the overactive protein directs cells to grow and divide constantly. This uncontrolled cell division can result in the formation of noncancerous and cancerous tumors. Researchers are uncertain how mutations in the HRAS gene cause the other features of Costello syndrome (such as intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and heart problems), but many of the signs and symptoms probably result from cell overgrowth and abnormal cell division. "
652,HSD3B2 ,"hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3 beta- and steroid delta-isomerase 2","The HSD3B2 gene provides instructions for making the 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) enzyme. This enzyme is found in the gonads, which are the ovaries in females and testes in males, and in the adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys. Within these hormone-producing tissues, the 3β-HSD enzyme is necessary for the production of many hormones, including cortisol, aldosterone, androgens, and estrogen. Cortisol has numerous functions such as maintaining energy and blood sugar levels, protecting the body from stress, and suppressing inflammation. Aldosterone is sometimes called the salt-retaining hormone because it regulates the amount of salt retained by the kidney. The retention of salt affects fluid levels and blood pressure. Androgens and estrogen are essential for normal sexual development and reproduction.","3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency At least 37 mutations in the HSD3B2 gene have been found to cause 3β-HSD deficiency. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the 3β-HSD enzyme, which typically reduces the activity of the enzyme. Mutations that allow the production of some functional enzyme, although at reduced levels, cause the less severe, non-salt-wasting or non-classic forms of 3β-HSD deficiency. Other mutations result in the production of an abnormally short, completely nonfunctional 3β-HSD enzyme, which causes the more severe, salt-wasting form of this condition. All types of 3β-HSD deficiency interfere with the production of a variety of hormones and lead to abnormalities of sexual development and maturation. "
653,HSD3B7 ,"hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3 beta- and steroid delta-isomerase 7","The HSD3B7 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7 (3β-HSD7). This enzyme is found in liver cells. It is embedded in the membrane of a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein processing and distribution. The 3β-HSD7 enzyme participates in the production of bile acids, which are a component of a digestive fluid called bile. Bile acids stimulate bile flow and helps absorb fats and fat-soluble vitamins. Bile acids are produced from cholesterol in a multi-step process. The 3β-HSD7 enzyme is responsible for the second step in that process, which converts 7alpha(α)-hydroxycholesterol to 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one.","Congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 1 At least 17 mutations in the HSD3B7 gene have been found to cause congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 1. This condition is characterized by cholestasis, a condition that impairs the production and release of a digestive fluid called bile from liver cells. Most of the HSD3B7 gene mutations delete one or two DNA building blocks (base pairs) from the gene or replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the enzyme. These mutations result in production of a 3β-HSD7 enzyme with little or no function. Without enough functional 3β-HSD7 enzyme, the conversion of 7α-hydroxycholesterol to 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one is impaired. The 7α-hydroxycholesterol instead gets converted into abnormal bile acid compounds that cannot be transported out of the liver into the intestine, where the bile acids are needed to absorb fats and fat-soluble vitamins. This impaired production and release of bile acids leads to cholestasis. As a result, cholesterol and abnormal bile acids build up in the liver and fat-soluble vitamins are not absorbed, leading to the signs and symptoms of congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 1. "
654,HSD17B3 ,hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 3,"The HSD17B3 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3. This enzyme is active in the male gonads (testes), where it helps to produce the male sex hormone testosterone from a precursor hormone called androstenedione.","17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 deficiency More than 20 mutations that cause 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 deficiency have been identified in the HSD17B3 gene. In the Arab population of Gaza, where the condition is most common, almost all affected individuals have two copies of the same mutation. This mutation replaces the protein building block (amino acid) arginine with the amino acid glutamine at protein position 80 (written as Arg80Gln or R80Q).Mutations in the HSD17B3 gene result in a 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 enzyme with little or no activity, reducing testosterone production. A shortage of testosterone affects the development of the reproductive tract in the male fetus, resulting in the abnormalities in the external sex organs that occur in 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 deficiency. "
655,HSD17B4 ,hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 4,"The HSD17B4 gene provides instructions for making the D-bifunctional protein. This protein is an enzyme, which means that it helps specific biochemical reactions take place. D-bifunctional protein is so named because it aids in two biochemical reactions.The D-bifunctional protein is found in sac-like cell structures (organelles) called peroxisomes, which contain a variety of enzymes that break down many different substances. The D-bifunctional protein is involved in the breakdown of certain molecules called fatty acids. The protein has two separate regions (domains) with enzyme activity, called the hydratase and dehydrogenase domains. These domains help carry out the second and third steps, respectively, of a process called the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. This process shortens the fatty acid molecules by two carbon atoms at a time until the fatty acids are converted to a molecule called acetyl-CoA, which is transported out of the peroxisomes for reuse by the cell.","D-bifunctional protein deficiency More than 60 HSD17B4 gene mutations have been identified in individuals with D-bifunctional protein deficiency, a severe disorder that causes deterioration of nervous system functions (neurodegeneration) beginning in infancy. HSD17B4 gene mutations that cause D-bifunctional protein deficiency can affect one or both of the enzymatic activities of D-bifunctional protein; however, this distinction does not seem to affect the severity or features of the disorder.Impairment of one or both of the D-bifunctional protein's enzymatic activities prevents it from breaking down fatty acids efficiently. As a result, these fatty acids accumulate in the body. It is unclear how fatty acid accumulation leads to the specific features of D-bifunctional protein deficiency; however, the accumulation may result in abnormal development of the brain and the breakdown of myelin, which is the covering that protects nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. Destruction of myelin leads to a loss of myelin-containing tissue (white matter) in the brain and spinal cord; loss of white matter is described as leukodystrophy. Abnormal brain development and leukodystrophy likely underlie the neurological abnormalities that occur in D-bifunctional protein deficiency. "
656,HSD17B10 ,hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 10,"The HSD17B10 gene provides instructions for making a protein called HSD10. This protein is located within mitochondria, the energy-producing centers inside cells, where it has several different functions.The HSD10 protein is important for the production (synthesis) of proteins in mitochondria. (While most protein synthesis occurs in the fluid surrounding the nucleus, called the cytoplasm, a few proteins are synthesized in the mitochondria.) During protein synthesis, whether in the cytoplasm or in mitochondria, molecules called transfer RNAs (tRNAs) help assemble protein building blocks (amino acids) into the chains that form proteins. The HSD10 protein is involved in making functional mitochondrial tRNA. It forms a complex with an enzyme called TRMT10C to modify tRNAs so that they are more stable and can function properly. In addition, the complex interacts with another enzyme called PRORP to perform an enzymatic function called mitochondrial RNase P (mtRNase P) that cuts precursor RNA molecules, which is an essential step to generating tRNA molecules. Normal mitochondrial protein production, which requires tRNAs, is essential for the formation of the protein complexes that convert the energy from food into a form cells can use.The HSD10 protein also plays an important role in processing several substances in the body. It helps break down the amino acid isoleucine. Specifically, it is responsible for the fifth step in this process, in which 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA is converted into 2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA. Through a similar mechanism, the HSD10 protein also processes a group of fats called branched-chain fatty acids.The HSD10 protein is also thought to be involved in chemical reactions involving female sex hormones (estrogens) and male sex hormones (androgens). HSD10 turns off (inactivates) a potent form of estrogen called 17β-estradiol by converting it to a weaker form called estrone. HSD10 also generates a potent androgen called dihydrotestosterone from a weak androgen called 3α-androstanediol. These reactions are critical for maintaining appropriate levels of male and female sex hormones.The HSD10 protein also plays a role in certain chemical reactions involving neurosteroids, which are substances that regulate the activity of the nervous system. This protein inactivates two neurosteroids called allopregnanolone and allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone. These neurosteroids interact with receptors that prevent the brain from being overloaded with too many signals. By regulating the activity of these neurosteroids, the HSD10 protein may help maintain normal brain function. However, other proteins in the body can also carry out these reactions, and the importance of HSD10 in these functions is unclear.","HSD10 disease More than 10 HSD17B10 gene mutations have been found to cause HSD10 disease, a disorder characterized by intellectual disability, impaired speech and movement, and a weakened heart muscle (cardiomyopathy). This disorder affects males more frequently and severely than females; many affected males do not survive beyond early childhood.Almost all of the mutations change single amino acids in the HSD10 protein. One mutation, which has been found in multiple unrelated individuals, replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid cysteine at position 130 in the protein (written as Arg130Cys or R130C). This mutation results in a nonfunctional protein that is quickly broken down by the cell. Other mutations do not reduce the amount of HSD10 protein in cells, but impair its function in other ways.A shortage or impaired function of HSD10 disrupts mtRNase P function, which impairs the processing of mitochondrial precursor RNA and the generation of tRNA molecules. A shortage of functional HSD10 also impairs the modification of tRNAs to make them more stable, further reducing the amount of functional tRNA molecules. This reduction in functional tRNAs decreases mitochondrial protein synthesis and the production of energy in the cell. The reduction of energy particularly affects the brain, eyes, and heart, leading to the characteristic features of HSD10 disease.While the shortage of functional HSD10 protein caused by HSD17B10 gene mutations also reduces the processing of isoleucine and other substances in the body, this mechanism does not appear to be primarily involved in the development of HSD10 disease.Some individuals have HSD17B10 gene mutations that affect only the breakdown of 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, which can be detected with laboratory tests, but do not have the signs and symptoms of HSD10 disease. "
657,HSPB1 ,heat shock protein family B (small) member 1,"The HSPB1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called heat shock protein beta-1 (also called heat shock protein 27). This protein is a member of the heat shock protein family, which helps protect cells under adverse conditions such as infection, inflammation, exposure to toxins, elevated temperature, injury, and disease. Heat shock proteins block signals that lead to programmed cell death. In addition, they appear to be involved in activities such as cell movement (motility), stabilizing the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton), folding and stabilizing newly produced proteins, and repairing damaged proteins. Heat shock proteins also appear to play a role in the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction).Heat shock protein beta-1 is found in cells throughout the body and is particularly abundant in nerve and muscle cells. In nerve cells, this protein helps to organize a network of molecular threads called neurofilaments that maintain the diameter of specialized extensions called axons. Maintaining proper axon diameter is essential for the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. Although it is thought to play a role in muscle contraction, the specific function of heat shock protein beta-1 in muscle cells is unclear.",Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Genetics Home Reference provides information about Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. 
658,HSPB8 ,heat shock protein family B (small) member 8,"The HSPB8 gene provides instructions for making a protein called heat shock protein beta-8 (also called heat shock protein 22). This protein is a member of the heat shock protein family, which helps protect cells under adverse conditions such as infection, inflammation, exposure to toxins, elevated temperature, injury, and disease. Heat shock proteins block signals that lead to programmed cell death. In addition, they appear to be involved in activities such as cell movement (motility), stabilizing the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton), folding and stabilizing newly produced proteins, and repairing damaged proteins. Heat shock proteins also appear to play a role in the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction).Heat shock protein beta-8 is found in cells throughout the body and is particularly abundant in nerve cells. While its function is not well understood, it seems to interact with a related protein called heat shock protein beta-1, produced from the HSPB1 gene. In nerve cells, heat shock protein beta-1 helps to organize a network of molecular threads called neurofilaments that maintain the diameter of specialized extensions called axons. Maintaining proper axon diameter is essential for the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. The specific role that heat shock protein beta-8 plays in axons is unclear.",Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Genetics Home Reference provides information about Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. 
659,HSPG2 ,heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2,"The HSPG2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called perlecan. This protein is found in the extracellular matrix, which is the intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. Specifically, it is found in part of the extracellular matrix called the basement membrane, which is a thin, sheet-like structure that separates and supports cells in many tissues. Perlecan is also found in cartilage, a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears.Perlecan is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, which is a type of protein that interacts with many other proteins and has a variety of functions. In particular, perlecan is involved in cell signaling, the sticking (adhesion) of cells to one another, the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), and the maintenance of basement membranes and cartilage throughout life. The protein also plays a critical role at the neuromuscular junction, which is the area between the ends of nerve cells and muscle cells where signals are relayed to trigger muscle contraction.","Schwartz-Jampel syndrome More than 30 mutations in the HSPG2 gene have been found to cause Schwartz-Jampel syndrome. This rare condition is characterized by continuous muscle contraction (myotonia) that restricts movement, as well as bone abnormalities known as chondrodysplasia. Most of the mutations reduce the amount of perlecan that is produced. Other mutations lead to a version of perlecan that is only partially functional. A reduction in the amount or function of this protein disrupts the normal development of cartilage and bone tissue, which underlies chondrodysplasia in affected individuals. A reduced amount of functional perlecan at the neuromuscular junction likely alters the balance of other molecules that signal when muscles should contract and when they should relax. As a result, muscle contraction is triggered continuously, leading to myotonia. "
660,HTRA1 ,HtrA serine peptidase 1,"The HTRA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in many of the body's organs and tissues. This protein is a type of enzyme called a serine protease, which has an active center that cuts (cleaves) other proteins into smaller pieces. The HTRA1 enzyme helps break down many other kinds of proteins in the space surrounding cells (the extracellular matrix).The HTRA1 enzyme also attaches (binds) to proteins in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) family and slows down (inhibits) their ability to send chemical signals. TGF-β proteins normally help control many critical cell functions, including the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (motility), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). TGF-β signaling also plays an important role in the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis).Researchers have proposed several additional functions for the HTRA1 enzyme. It may play a role in the stabilization of microtubules, which are rigid, hollow fibers that make up the cell's structural framework (cytoskeleton). Additionally, the HTRA1 enzyme may be involved in depositing minerals, such as calcium and phosphorus, in developing bone (mineralization). Studies have also suggested that the HTRA1 enzyme acts as a tumor suppressor, a protein that helps prevent the development of cancerous tumors by keeping cells from growing and dividing in an uncontrolled way.","Cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy At least four mutations in the HTRA1 gene have been found to cause cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, commonly known as CARASIL. This condition is characterized by a highly increased risk of stroke, deterioration of cognitive function (dementia), premature hair loss (alopecia), and attacks of low back pain. These signs and symptoms usually become apparent in early to mid-adulthood.The HTRA1 gene mutations responsible for CARASIL reduce or eliminate the function of the HTRA1 enzyme. As a result, the enzyme is not available to inhibit signaling by TGF-β proteins. Researchers suspect that abnormally increased TGF-β signaling alters the structure of small blood vessels, particularly in the brain. These blood vessel abnormalities increase the risk of stroke and lead to the death of nerve cells (neurons) in many areas of the brain. Dysregulation of TGF-β signaling may also underlie the hair loss and back pain seen in people with CARASIL, although the relationship between abnormal TGF-β signaling and these features is less clear. "
661,HTT ,huntingtin,"The HTT gene provides instructions for making a protein called huntingtin. Although the exact function of this protein is unknown, it appears to play an important role in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and is essential for normal development before birth. Huntingtin is found in many of the body's tissues, with the highest levels of activity in the brain. Within cells, this protein may be involved in chemical signaling, transporting materials, attaching (binding) to proteins and other structures, and protecting the cell from self-destruction (apoptosis).One region of the HTT gene contains a particular DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (cytosine, adenine, and guanine) that appear multiple times in a row. Normally, the CAG segment is repeated 10 to 35 times within the gene.","Huntington disease The inherited mutation that causes Huntington disease is known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion. This mutation increases the size of the CAG segment in the HTT gene. People with Huntington disease have 36 to more than 120 CAG repeats. People with 36 to 39 CAG repeats may or may not develop the signs and symptoms of Huntington disease, while people with 40 or more repeats almost always develop the disorder.The expanded CAG segment leads to the production of an abnormally long version of the huntingtin protein. The elongated protein is cut into smaller, toxic fragments that bind together and accumulate in neurons, disrupting the normal functions of these cells. This process particularly affects regions of the brain that help coordinate movement and control thinking and emotions (the striatum and cerebral cortex). The dysfunction and eventual death of neurons in these areas of the brain underlie the signs and symptoms of Huntington disease.As the altered HTT gene is passed from one generation to the next, the size of the CAG trinucleotide repeat often increases in size. A larger number of repeats is usually associated with an earlier onset of signs and symptoms. This phenomenon is called anticipation. People with the adult-onset form of Huntington disease (which appears in mid-adulthood) typically have 40 to 50 CAG repeats in the HTT gene, while people with the less common, juvenile form of the disorder (which appears in childhood or adolescence) tend to have more than 60 CAG repeats.Individuals who have 27 to 35 CAG repeats in the HTT gene do not develop Huntington disease, but they are at risk of having children who will develop the disorder. As the gene is passed from parent to child, the size of the CAG trinucleotide repeat may lengthen into the range associated with Huntington disease (36 repeats or more). "
662,IDH1 ,"isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP(+)) 1, cytosolic","The IDH1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called isocitrate dehydrogenase 1. This enzyme is primarily found in the fluid-filled space inside cells (the cytoplasm). It is also found in cellular structures called peroxisomes, which are small sacs within cells that process many types of molecules. In both the cytoplasm and in peroxisomes, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 converts a compound called isocitrate to another compound called 2-ketoglutarate. This reaction also produces a molecule called NADPH, which is necessary for many cellular processes. The NADPH produced from isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 is involved in the breakdown of fats for energy, and it also protects cells from potentially harmful molecules called reactive oxygen species.","Maffucci syndrome Mutations in the IDH1 gene can cause Maffucci syndrome, a disorder that primarily affects the bones and skin. It is characterized by multiple enchondromas, which are noncancerous (benign) growths of cartilage that develop in the bones, and red or purplish growths in the skin consisting of tangles of abnormal blood vessels (hemangiomas).The IDH1 gene mutations that cause Maffucci syndrome are somatic, which means they occur during a person's lifetime and are not inherited. A somatic mutation occurs in a single cell. As that cell continues to grow and divide, the cells derived from it also have the same mutation. In Maffucci syndrome, the mutation is thought to occur in a cell during early development before birth; cells that arise from that abnormal cell have the mutation, while the body's other cells do not. This situation is called mosaicism.IDH1 gene mutations have been found in some cells of enchondromas and hemangiomas in people with Maffucci syndrome, as well as in the bone marrow or blood of a few affected individuals. These mutations prevent isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 from carrying out its usual activity, the conversion of isocitrate to 2-ketoglutarate. Instead, the altered enzyme takes on a new, abnormal function: the production of a compound called D-2-hydroxyglutarate. Because the genetic changes lead to an enzyme with a new function, they are classified as ""gain-of-function"" mutations. The relationship between the mutations and the signs and symptoms of the disorder is not well understood. "
663,IDH2 ,"isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP(+)) 2, mitochondrial","The IDH2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called isocitrate dehydrogenase 2. This enzyme is found in mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers within cells. Within mitochondria, the enzyme participates in reactions that produce energy for cell activities. Specifically, isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 normally converts a compound called isocitrate to another compound called 2-ketoglutarate. A series of additional enzymes further process 2-ketoglutarate to produce energy. The conversion reaction also produces a molecule called NADPH, which is necessary for many cellular processes and helps protect cells from potentially harmful molecules called reactive oxygen species.","2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria At least two mutations in the IDH2 gene have been found to cause a type of 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria known as D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D-2-HGA) type II. This condition has a variety of signs and symptoms that result primarily from progressive damage to the brain beginning early in life.The mutations that cause D-2-HGA type II are present in all of an affected person's cells. These mutations prevent isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 from carrying out its usual activity, the conversion of isocitrate to 2-ketoglutarate. Instead, the altered enzyme takes on a new, abnormal function: the production of a compound called D-2-hydroxyglutarate. Because the genetic changes lead to an enzyme with a new function, they are classified as ""gain-of-function"" mutations.In people with D-2-HGA type II, D-2-hydroxyglutarate builds up abnormally in cells. At high levels, this compound can damage cells and lead to cell death. Brain cells appear to be the most vulnerable to the toxic effects of this compound, which may explain why the signs and symptoms of D-2-HGA type II primarily involve the brain. However, some people with this form of the disorder also have a weakened and enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy). It is unclear why an accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate may be associated with cardiomyopathy. "
664,IDS ,iduronate 2-sulfatase,"The IDS gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called iduronate 2-sulfatase (I2S), which is essential for the breakdown of large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Specifically, I2S removes a chemical group known as a sulfate from a molecule called sulfated alpha-L-iduronic acid, which is present in two GAGs called heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. I2S is located in lysosomes, compartments within cells that digest and recycle different types of molecules.","Mucopolysaccharidosis type II More than 300 mutations in the IDS gene have been found to cause mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II). Mutations that change one DNA building block (nucleotide) are the most common. All mutations that cause MPS II reduce or completely eliminate the function of I2S. It usually cannot be determined whether a certain mutation will cause severe or mild MPS II; however, mutations that result in the complete absence of I2S cause the more severe form of the disorder.Lack of I2S enzyme activity leads to the accumulation of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate within cells, specifically inside the lysosomes. The buildup of these GAGs increases the size of the lysosomes, which is why many tissues and organs are enlarged in MPS II. Researchers believe that the accumulated GAGs may also interfere with the functions of other proteins inside the lysosomes and disrupt the movement of molecules inside the cell. "
665,IDUA ,"iduronidase, alpha-L-","The IDUA gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called alpha-L-iduronidase, which is essential for the breakdown of large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Through a process called hydrolysis, alpha-L-iduronidase uses water molecules to break down a molecule known as unsulfated alpha-L-iduronic acid, which is present in two GAGs called heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. Alpha-L-iduronidase is located in lysosomes, compartments within cells that digest and recycle different types of molecules.","Mucopolysaccharidosis type I More than 100 mutations in the IDUA gene have been found to cause mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I). Mutations that change one DNA building block (nucleotide) are the most common. All mutations that cause MPS I reduce or completely eliminate the function of alpha-L-iduronidase. It usually cannot be determined whether a certain mutation will cause severe or attenuated MPS I; however, people who do not produce any alpha-L-iduronidase have the severe form of this disorder.The lack of alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme activity leads to the accumulation of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate within the lysosomes. The buildup of these GAGs increases the size of the lysosomes, which is why many tissues and organs are enlarged in MPS I. Researchers believe that the accumulated GAGs may also interfere with the functions of other proteins inside the lysosomes and disrupt the movement of molecules inside the cell. "
666,IFIH1 ,interferon induced with helicase C domain 1,"The IFIH1 gene provides instructions for making the MDA5 protein, which plays an important role in innate immunity, the body's early, nonspecific response to foreign invaders (pathogens) such as viruses and bacteria. In particular, the MDA5 protein recognizes a molecule called double-stranded RNA (a chemical cousin of DNA), which certain viruses, including rhinovirus (the virus that causes the common cold), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and the influenza (flu) virus, have as their genetic material or produce when they infect cells and copy (replicate) themselves. (Another subset of viruses has DNA as the genetic material.) When pieces of viral RNA are present inside a cell, multiple MDA5 proteins attach to it, one after another, forming a filament. Filament formation stimulates signals that turn on the production of immune system proteins called interferons. Interferons control the activity of genes that help block the viruses from replicating themselves and stimulate the activity of certain immune system cells to fight infection. Interferons also help regulate inflammation, which is another part of the body's innate immune response.","Aicardi-Goutières syndrome At least 12 IFIH1 gene mutations have been found in people with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. This disorder is characterized by abnormalities of the immune system, skin, and brain, including calcium deposits in parts of the brain.The IFIH1 gene mutations involved in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome are described as ""gain-of-function"" because they lead to production of an MDA5 protein with enhanced activity. The altered protein may more readily attach to RNA, even pieces of RNA that are not from viruses, or to other MDA5 proteins to form filaments. Alternatively, filaments containing the altered protein may not be broken down when immune signaling is no longer needed. As a result of these changes, interferon production is abnormally turned on, leading to excessive immune system activity and inflammation.Constant inflammation is thought to disrupt the way calcium is handled in the body, leading to calcium deposits in people with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. Excessive inflammation is also thought to damage cells in the brain and skin, leading to the abnormalities in these tissues characteristic of this disorder. "
667,IFT43 ,intraflagellar transport 43,"The IFT43 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the formation and maintenance of cilia, which are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. Cilia participate in signaling pathways that transmit information within and between cells and are important for the development and function of many types of cells and tissues, including cells in the kidneys and liver and the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). Cilia also play a role in the development of the bones, although the mechanism is not well understood.The movement of substances within cilia and similar structures called flagella is known as intraflagellar transport. This process is essential for the assembly and maintenance of these cell structures. During intraflagellar transport, cells use molecules called IFT particles to carry materials to and from the tips of cilia. Each IFT particle is made up of two groups of IFT proteins: complex A and complex B. The protein produced from the IFT43 gene forms part of IFT complex A (IFT-A). During intraflagellar transport, this complex carries materials from the tip to the base of cilia.The IFT-A complex is essential for proper regulation of the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is important for the growth and maturation (differentiation) of cells and the normal shaping (patterning) of many parts of the body, especially during embryonic development. The exact role of the complex in this pathway is unclear.","Cranioectodermal dysplasia A mutation in the IFT43 gene is a rare cause of cranioectodermal dysplasia. This condition is characterized by an elongated head (dolichocephaly) with a prominent forehead and other distinctive facial features; short bones; and abnormalities of certain tissues known as ectodermal tissues, which include the teeth, hair, nails, and skin.The IFT43 gene mutation involved in cranioectodermal dysplasia leads to production of an abnormally short IFT43 protein, which is likely broken down quickly. Shortage of this component of the IFT-A complex impairs the function of the entire complex, disrupting transport of proteins and materials from the tips of cilia. As a result, assembly and maintenance of cilia is impaired, which leads to a smaller number of cilia and abnormalities in their shape and structure. Although the mechanism is unclear, a loss of normal cilia impedes proper development of bone and other tissues, leading to the features of cranioectodermal dysplasia. Some researchers suggest that disrupted intraflagellar transport prevents signaling through the Sonic Hedgehog pathway, which could impact cell growth and other functions in several tissues throughout the body. "
668,IFT80 ,intraflagellar transport 80,"The IFT80 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of a group (complex) called IFT complex B. This complex is found in cell structures known as cilia. Cilia are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. IFT complex B is involved in a process called intraflagellar transport (IFT), by which materials are carried within cilia. Specifically, this complex helps transport materials from the base of cilia to the tip.IFT is essential for the assembly and maintenance of cilia. These cell structures play central roles in many different chemical signaling pathways, including a series of reactions called the Sonic Hedgehog pathway. These pathways are important for the growth and division (proliferation) and maturation (differentiation) of cells. In particular, Sonic Hedgehog appears to be essential for the proliferation and differentiation of cells that ultimately give rise to cartilage and bone.","Asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy Mutations in the IFT80 gene were the first genetic changes found to cause asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy, an inherited disorder of bone growth characterized by a small chest, short ribs, and shortened bones in the arms and legs. At least six mutations in the IFT80 gene have since been associated with this disorder. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the IFT80 protein. IFT complex B made with the altered protein cannot function normally, which disrupts the transport of materials within cilia. Researchers speculate that these changes in IFT alter certain signaling pathways, including the Sonic Hedgehog pathway, which may underlie the abnormalities of bone growth characteristic of asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy.In some affected individuals, asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy is also associated with abnormalities of the kidneys, liver, retinas, and other tissues. However, when the disorder results from IFT80 gene mutations, its features are usually limited to problems with bone growth. The reasons for this difference are unknown. "
669,IFT122 ,intraflagellar transport 122,"The IFT122 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the formation and maintenance of cilia, which are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. Cilia participate in signaling pathways that transmit information within and between cells and are important for the development and function of many types of cells and tissues, including cells in the kidneys and liver and the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). Cilia also play a role in the development of the bones, although the mechanism is not well understood.The movement of substances within cilia and similar structures called flagella is known as intraflagellar transport.

Each IFT particle is made up of two groups of IFT proteins: complex A and complex B. The protein produced from the IFT122 gene forms part of IFT complex A (IFT-A). During intraflagellar transport, this complex carries materials from the tip to the base of cilia.The IFT-A complex is essential for proper regulation of the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is important for the growth and maturation (differentiation) of cells and the normal shaping (patterning) of many parts of the body, especially during embryonic development. The exact role of the complex in this pathway is unclear.","Cranioectodermal dysplasia Mutations in the IFT122 gene can cause cranioectodermal dysplasia. This condition is characterized by an elongated head (dolichocephaly) with a prominent forehead and other distinctive facial features; short bones; and abnormalities of certain tissues known as ectodermal tissues, which include the teeth, hair, nails, and skin.At least six IFT122 gene mutations have been found in people with cranioectodermal dysplasia. These mutations reduce the amount or function of the IFT122 protein. A shortage or reduction in activity of this component of the IFT-A complex impairs the function of the entire complex, disrupting transport of proteins and materials from the tips of cilia. As a result, assembly and maintenance of cilia is impaired, which leads to a smaller number of cilia and abnormalities in their shape and structure. Although the mechanism is unclear, a loss of normal cilia impedes proper development of bone and other tissues, leading to the features of cranioectodermal dysplasia. Some researchers suggest that disrupted intraflagellar transport prevents signaling through the Sonic Hedgehog pathway, which could impact cell growth and other functions in several tissues throughout the body. "
670,IFT140 ,intraflagellar transport 140,"The IFT140 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the formation and maintenance of cilia, which are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells and participate in signaling pathways that transmit information within and between cells. Cilia are important for the structure and function of many types of cells, including cells in the kidneys, liver, and brain. Light-sensing cells (photoreceptors) in the retina also contain cilia, which are essential for normal vision. Cilia also play a role in the development of the bones, although the mechanism is not well understood.The movement of substances within cilia and similar structures called flagella is known as intraflagellar transport. This process is essential for the assembly and maintenance of these cell structures. During intraflagellar transport, cells use molecules called IFT particles to carry materials to and from the tips of cilia. IFT particles are made of proteins produced from related genes that belong to the IFT gene family. Each IFT particle is made up of two groups of IFT proteins: complex A, which includes at least 6 proteins, and complex B, which includes at least 15 proteins. The protein produced from the IFT140 gene forms part of IFT complex A (IFT-A).","Mainzer-Saldino syndrome At least nine IFT140 gene mutations have been identified in people with Mainzer-Saldino syndrome, a disorder characterized by kidney disease, eye problems, and skeletal abnormalities. Mutations in the IFT140 gene that cause Mainzer-Saldino syndrome may change the shape of the IFT140 protein or its interactions with other IFT proteins, likely impairing the assembly of IFT-A and the development or maintenance of cilia. As a result, fewer cilia may be present or functional, affecting many organs and tissues in the body and resulting in the signs and symptoms of Mainzer-Saldino syndrome. Disorders such as Mainzer-Saldino syndrome that are caused by problems with cilia and involve bone abnormalities are called skeletal ciliopathies. "
671,IGF2 ,insulin like growth factor 2,"The IGF2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called insulin-like growth factor 2. This protein plays an essential role in growth and development before birth. Studies suggest that insulin-like growth factor 2 promotes the growth and division (proliferation) of cells in many different tissues. Although the IGF2 gene is highly active during fetal development, it is much less active after birth.People inherit one copy of most genes from their mother and one copy from their father. Both copies are typically active, or ""turned on,"" in cells. However, the activity of the IGF2 gene depends on which parent it was inherited from. Only the copy inherited from a person's father (the paternally inherited copy) is active; the copy inherited from the mother (the maternally inherited copy) is not active. This parent-specific difference in gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting.IGF2 is part of a cluster of genes on the short (p) arm of chromosome 11 that undergoes genomic imprinting. Another gene in this cluster, H19, is also involved in growth and development. A nearby region of DNA known as imprinting center 1 (IC1) or the H19 differentially methylated region (H19 DMR) controls the parent-specific genomic imprinting of both the IGF2 and H19 genes. The IC1 region undergoes a process called methylation, which is a chemical reaction that attaches small molecules called methyl groups to certain segments of DNA. Methylation, which occurs during the formation of an egg or sperm cell, is a way of marking or ""stamping"" the parent of origin. The IC1 region is normally methylated only on the paternally inherited copy of chromosome 11.","Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, a condition characterized by overgrowth and other signs and symptoms that affect many parts of the body, can result from changes that affect the IC1 region. In some people with this condition, the maternally inherited copy of the IC1 region is methylated along with the paternally inherited copy. Because the IC1 region controls the genomic imprinting of the IGF2 and H19 genes, this abnormality disrupts the regulation of both genes. Specifically, abnormal methylation of the IC1 region leads to increased IGF2 gene activity and a loss of H19 gene activity in many tissues. An increase in IGF2 gene activity, which promotes growth, and a loss of H19 gene activity, which normally restrains growth, together lead to overgrowth in people with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.In a few cases, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome has been caused by deletions of a small amount of DNA from the IC1 region. Like abnormal methylation, these deletions alter the activity of the IGF2 and H19 genes. "
672,IGFBP7 ,insulin like growth factor binding protein 7,"The IGFBP7 gene provides instructions for making a protein called insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7). Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are molecules that are involved in promoting cell growth and division and preventing cells from self-destructing (undergoing apoptosis) prematurely. The IGFBP7 protein is one of a group of proteins that help control the availability of IGFs in body fluids and tissues and increase or decrease the attachment (binding) of IGFs to other molecules called receptors. The binding of IGFs and their receptors activates the cell signaling processes in which they are involved.The IGFBP7 protein is active in the lining of blood vessels (the vascular endothelium). Its interactions with IGFs and their receptors are thought to help stop a pathway called BRAF signaling, which is involved in directing cell growth.","Retinal arterial macroaneurysm with supravalvular pulmonic stenosis A single IGFBP7 gene mutation has been identified in people with retinal arterial macroaneurysm with supravalvular pulmonic stenosis (RAMSVPS), a disorder that affects blood vessels in the eyes and heart. In affected individuals, the mutation occurs in both copies of the gene in each cell. The mutation, written as 830-1G>A, is called a splice-site mutation, which means that it affects the way the protein is pieced together. The protein produced from the mutated IGFBP7 gene is abnormally short and does not function properly.Without normally functioning IGFBP7 protein to control BRAF signaling, this signaling is increased. It is unknown how this increase is related to the specific blood vessel abnormalities that occur in RAMSVPS, or why these abnormalities are confined to the eyes and the pulmonary artery. Researchers suggest that differences in normal levels of IGFBP7 protein in various parts of the body or the presence of other proteins with a similar function in different tissues may account for the specific signs and symptoms of this disorder. "
673,IGHMBP2 ,immunoglobulin mu DNA binding protein 2,"The IGHMBP2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called immunoglobulin mu DNA binding protein 2 (IGHMBP2). This enzyme functions as a helicase, which means that it attaches to particular regions of DNA and temporarily unwinds the two spiral strands of these molecules. When a cell prepares to divide to form two cells, the chromosomes are duplicated (replicated) so that each new cell will get a complete set of chromosomes. The replication process involves unwinding the DNA so that it can be copied. This mechanism is also involved in the production of RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. Additionally, the IGHMBP2 protein is thought to be involved in the production of proteins from RNA through a process called translation. The IGHMBP2 protein is produced in cells throughout the body.","Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 More than 60 mutations in the IGHMBP2 gene have been found to cause spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1). SMARD1 is an inherited condition that causes muscle weakness and respiratory failure typically beginning in infancy. Most mutations that cause this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the IGHMBP2 protein and disrupt the protein's ability to unwind DNA and RNA. The loss of helicase function impedes DNA replication and the production of RNA and proteins. These problems particularly affect alpha-motor neurons, which are specialized cells in the brainstem and spinal cord that control muscle movements. Altered IGHMBP2 proteins cause these neurons to become damaged and die over time, although the exact mechanism is unknown. The cumulative death of alpha-motor neurons leads to breathing problems and progressive muscle weakness in children with SMARD1. "
674,IKBKG ,inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit gamma,"The IKBKG gene provides instructions for producing one piece (subunit) of the IKK protein complex, which is a group of related proteins that regulates the activity of nuclear factor-kappa-B. Nuclear factor-kappa-B is a protein complex that binds to DNA and controls the activity of other genes. When it is turned off (inactive), nuclear factor-kappa-B is attached (bound) to the IKK complex. In response to certain signals, the IKK complex turns on (activates) nuclear factor-kappa-B and releases it.The IKBKG protein plays a regulatory role in the IKK complex. Once the IKBKG protein is turned on (activated), it activates the other proteins in the complex, which in turn activates and releases nuclear factor-kappa-B. The activated factor then moves into the nucleus and binds to DNA. Nuclear factor-kappa-B regulates the activity of multiple genes, including genes that control the body's immune responses and inflammatory reactions. Nuclear factor-kappa-B also appears to play a role in the signaling pathway that is critical for the formation of ectodermal tissues including the skin, hair, teeth, and sweat glands. In addition, it protects the cell from certain signals that would otherwise cause it to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis).","Anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency More than 20 mutations in the IKBKG gene have been found to cause anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency (EDA-ID). EDA-ID is a condition characterized by reduced function of the immune system, resulting in recurrent infections, and abnormal development of ectodermal tissues. The IKBKG gene mutations that cause EDA-ID impair the function of the IKBKG protein but do not completely eliminate its ability to regulate nuclear factor-kappa-B. These changes disrupt certain signaling pathways within immune cells and cells that form ectodermal tissues, resulting in immune deficiency and incomplete development of tissues of the ectoderm. The severity of the signs and symptoms of EDA-ID depends on the amount of protein function remaining; a greater level of protein function is associated with milder disease. "
675,IL1A ,interleukin 1 alpha,"The IL1A gene provides instructions for making a protein called interleukin-1 alpha. Interleukins are a group of proteins that are made primarily in immune system cells. They are involved in cell-to-cell communication and have a wide variety of functions within the immune system. Interleukin-1 alpha is described as ""pro-inflammatory"" because it stimulates the activity of genes involved in inflammation and immunity. This protein plays a critical role in protecting the body from foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. It is also involved in bone resorption, the breakdown and removal of bone tissue that is no longer needed.Interleukin-1 alpha is initially produced as a relatively long protein that is trapped within cells. Another protein, called calpain, cuts (cleaves) this precursor protein to create a shorter, mature version of interleukin-1 alpha. The shorter form of this protein is secreted by immune system cells to influence the functions of other cells.","Ankylosing spondylitis Several variations (polymorphisms) in the IL1A gene have been found to influence the risk of ankylosing spondylitis. Each of these variations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in interleukin-1 alpha. It is unclear how these variations alter the protein's function. Studies suggest that the effects of IL1A variations are probably related to the role of interleukin-1 alpha in promoting inflammation. Other genetic and environmental factors, many of which are unknown, also affect the chance of developing ankylosing spondylitis. "
676,IL2RG ,interleukin 2 receptor subunit gamma,"The IL2RG gene provides instructions for making a protein called the common gamma chain. This protein is a component of several different receptors that are involved in immune system function. The receptors span the cell membrane, with one end outside the cell like an antenna and the other end inside to transmit signals to the nucleus. Other proteins attach to these receptors, like a key in a lock, to trigger a series of chemical reactions inside the cell.Receptors containing the common gamma chain are located on the surface of immature blood-forming cells in bone marrow. They partner with other proteins to direct blood-forming cells to form lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). The receptors also regulate the growth and maturation of several subtypes of lymphocytes: T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells. These cells kill viruses, make antibodies, and help regulate the entire immune system.","X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency More than 300 mutations in the IL2RG gene have been identified in people with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Most of these mutations involve changes in one or a few DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the gene. These changes lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of the common gamma chain or prevent any protein from being produced. Without the common gamma chain, important chemical signals are not relayed to the nucleus and lymphocytes cannot develop normally. A lack of functional mature lymphocytes prevents the immune system from fighting off infections. "
677,IL7R ,interleukin 7 receptor,"The IL7R gene provides instructions for making a protein called interleukin 7 (IL-7) receptor alpha chain. This protein is one piece of both the IL-7 receptor and the thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) receptor. These receptors are embedded in the cell membrane of immune system cells. The IL-7 receptor is found in B cells and T cells as well as the early blood-forming cells that give rise to them. The TSLP receptor is found in several types of immune cells, including B cells, T cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells. These cells identify foreign substances and defend the body against infection and disease.At the cell surface, the IL-7 receptor interacts with a protein called IL-7. IL-7 is a cytokine, which is a protein that regulates the activity of immune system cells. The receptor and cytokine fit together like a lock and its key, triggering a series of chemical signals inside the cell. In early blood-forming cells, signaling through the IL-7 receptor ensures the development of mature B cells and T cells. IL-7 receptor signaling also stimulates the later growth and division (proliferation) and survival of these cells.Similarly, the TSLP receptor interacts with the cytokine TSLP. Attachment of TSLP to its receptor triggers a set of signals that support proliferation and maturation of a variety of immune system cells.","Multiple sclerosis A common variation of the IL-7R gene increases the risk of developing multiple sclerosis. This condition affects the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), causing muscle weakness, poor coordination, numbness, and a variety of other health problems. The genetic variation involved in multiple sclerosis affects a single protein building block (amino acid) in the IL-7 receptor alpha chain, specifying the amino acid isoleucine at position 244 instead of the amino acid threonine (written as Thr244Ile). The IL-7 receptor that contains this version of the alpha chain is not embedded in the cell surface but is instead found inside the cell. It is not clear if this alpha chain variant affects the TSLP receptor.Because the IL7R gene is involved in regulation of the immune system, changes in it might be involved in the autoimmune response and inflammation that damage nerves and the protective coating surrounding them (the myelin sheath), leading to the signs and symptoms of multiple sclerosis. (Autoimmunity occurs when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs, in this case tissues of the nervous system.) However, it is unclear exactly what role the IL-7R gene variant plays in development of multiple sclerosis. It is likely that a combination of genetic and environmental factors is involved. "
678,IL17RC ,interleukin 17 receptor C,"The IL17RC gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in immune system function, specifically in the body's defense against a fungus called Candida. When the immune system recognizes Candida, it generates cells called Th17 cells. These cells produce signaling molecules (cytokines) called the interleukin-17 (IL-17) family as part of an immune process called the IL-17 pathway. The IL-17 pathway creates inflammation, sending other cytokines and white blood cells that fight foreign invaders and promote tissue repair. In addition, the IL-17 pathway promotes the production of certain antimicrobial protein segments (peptides) that control growth of Candida on the surface of mucous membranes.The protein produced from the IL17RC gene is present in many tissue types in the body, and is involved in cell signaling as part of the IL-17 pathway. Together with the protein produced from the IL17RA gene, it forms one of several receptors for IL-17 cytokines. Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. Certain IL-17 cytokines attach to receptors containing the IL17RC and IL17RA proteins, triggering signals that promote inflammation and the defense against Candida infection.","Familial candidiasis At least three mutations in the IL17RC gene have been identified in people with familial candidiasis, an inherited tendency to develop infections caused by the Candida fungus (commonly known as yeast infections). Most people with familial candidiasis have chronic yeast infections of the skin, nails, and mucous membranes (collectively called chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis) beginning in early childhood.IL17RC gene mutations result in an absence of IL17RC receptor protein. Loss of this protein impairs binding of IL-17 cytokines and IL-17 signaling. This impaired signaling decreases production of the antimicrobial peptides and inflammatory molecules that are critical for defense against Candida, and results in the chronic infection that occurs in familial candidiasis. "
679,IL23R ,interleukin 23 receptor,"The IL23R gene provides instructions for making a protein called the interleukin 23 (IL-23) receptor. This protein is embedded in the outer membrane of several types of immune system cells, including T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells. These cells identify foreign substances and defend the body against infection and disease.At the cell surface, the IL-23 receptor interacts with a protein called IL-23. These two proteins fit together like a lock and key. IL-23 is a cytokine, which is a type of protein that regulates the activity of immune cells. When IL-23 binds to its receptor, it triggers a series of chemical signals inside the cell. These signals promote inflammation and help coordinate the immune system's response to foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses.","Ankylosing spondylitis Several variations (polymorphisms) in the IL23R gene have been found to influence the risk of ankylosing spondylitis. One of these variations appears to reduce the likelihood of developing this disorder. This genetic change alters a single protein building block (amino acid) in the IL-23 receptor, replacing the amino acid arginine with the amino acid glutamine at protein position 381 (written as Arg381Gln or R381Q). Other IL23R variations appear to increase the risk of developing ankylosing spondylitis. It is not clear how these changes are related to a person's risk of developing this disorder, but studies suggest that the effects of IL23R variations are likely related to the IL-23 receptor's role in inflammation. Other genetic and environmental factors, many of which are unknown, also affect the chance of developing ankylosing spondylitis. "
680,IL31RA ,interleukin 31 receptor A,"The IL31RA gene provides instructions for making a protein called interleukin-31 receptor alpha subunit (IL-31RA). This protein is one piece (subunit) of the IL-31 receptor, which is embedded in the cell membrane of many types of cells throughout the body.At the cell surface, the IL-31 receptor interacts with a protein called interleukin 31 (IL-31). The receptor and IL-31 fit together like a lock and its key, triggering a series of chemical signals inside the cell. These signals stimulate itching (pruritus) and an immune system response called inflammation, although the mechanism is not completely understood.","Primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis At least one mutation in the IL31RA gene has been found to cause primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis (PLCA) type 2, an itchy skin condition in which clumps of abnormal proteins called amyloids build up in the skin. This mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in IL-31RA, replacing the amino acid serine with the amino acid phenylalanine at protein position 521 (written as Ser521Phe or S521F). This change occurs in a region of the protein thought to interact with the other subunit of the IL-31 receptor and may impair the receptor's formation.The IL31RA gene mutation that causes PLCA reduces the chemical signals triggered by IL-31. While IL-31 signaling plays a role in itching, it is unclear how a reduction of this signaling is involved in itchy skin or the buildup of amyloids in PLCA. "
681,IL36RN ,interleukin 36 receptor antagonist,"The IL36RN gene provides instructions for making a protein called interleukin 36 receptor antagonist (IL-36Ra). This protein is primarily found in the skin where it helps regulate inflammation, part of the body's early immune response. Inflammation in the skin is stimulated when other proteins called IL-36 alpha (α), IL-36 beta (β), or IL-36 gamma (γ) attach to (bind) a specific receptor protein. This binding turns on (activates) signaling pathways that promote inflammation, namely the NF-κB and MAPK pathways. To control inflammatory reactions, the IL-36Ra protein binds to the receptor protein so that IL-36α, IL-36β, and IL-36γ cannot. In this way, the IL-36Ra protein blocks (antagonizes) the receptor's activity.","Generalized pustular psoriasis More than a dozen IL36RN gene mutations have been found to increase susceptibility to a serious skin disorder called generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP). Individuals with this condition have repeated episodes in which large areas of skin become red and inflamed and develop small pus-filled blisters (pustules). The skin problems can be accompanied by fever and other signs of inflammation throughout the body (systemic inflammation). The episodes are thought to be triggered by infections, certain medications, menstruation, pregnancy, or other stresses on the body.The IL36RN gene mutations associated with GPP reduce the amount of IL-36Ra protein in the skin or eliminate it altogether. Without control by IL-36Ra, signaling pathways that promote inflammation are overly active, resulting in uncontrolled inflammation, particularly in the skin.IL36RN gene mutations increase the risk of developing GPP. Not everyone with mutations in this gene has the characteristic problems with inflammation. This complex condition is thought to arise from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. "
682,INS ,insulin,"The INS gene provides instructions for producing the hormone insulin, which is necessary for the control of glucose levels in the blood. Glucose is a simple sugar and the primary energy source for most cells in the body.Insulin is produced in a precursor form called proinsulin, which consists of a single chain of protein building blocks (amino acids). The proinsulin chain is cut (cleaved) to form individual pieces called the A and B chains, which are joined together by connections called disulfide bonds to form insulin.","Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus At least 10 mutations in the INS gene have been identified in people with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus. Individuals with this condition often have a low birth weight and develop increased blood sugar (hyperglycemia) within the first 6 months of life.INS gene mutations that cause permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the protein sequence. These mutations are believed to disrupt the cleavage of the proinsulin chain or the binding of the A and B chains to form insulin, leading to impaired blood sugar control. "
683,INSR ,insulin receptor,"The INSR gene provides instructions for making a protein called an insulin receptor, which is found in many types of cells. Insulin receptors are embedded in the outer membrane surrounding the cell, where they attach (bind) to the hormone insulin circulating in the bloodstream. Insulin plays many roles in the body, including regulating blood sugar levels by controlling how much sugar (in the form of glucose) is passed from the bloodstream into cells to be used as energy.The insulin receptor is initially produced as a single long protein that must be processed by being cut (cleaved) into four parts: two alpha subunits and two beta subunits. These subunits work together as a functioning receptor. The alpha subunits stick out from the surface of the cell, while the beta subunits remain inside the cell. The alpha subunits attach (bind) to insulin, which causes the beta subunits to trigger signaling pathways within the cell that influence many cell functions.","Donohue syndrome Researchers have identified more than 150 INSR gene mutations that cause a spectrum of related disorders known as severe insulin resistance syndromes. These include Donohue syndrome and two other conditions, Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome and type A insulin resistance syndrome (described below). Insulin resistance is a condition in which the body's tissues and organs do not respond properly to insulin. Severe insulin resistance syndromes are characterized by problems with regulating blood sugar levels and impaired development and function of organs and tissues throughout the body. Donohue syndrome is the most severe of the three syndromes; affected children do not survive beyond age 2.The INSR gene mutations associated with Donohue syndrome occur in both copies of the gene in each cell. Some of these mutations interfere with the normal processing of the protein initially produced from the INSR gene, which prevents the formation of a functioning insulin receptor. Other mutations impair the receptor's ability to bind to insulin or disrupt the cell signaling pathways that insulin binding normally triggers. All of these mutations greatly reduce or eliminate the function of insulin receptors. Although insulin is present in the bloodstream, without functional receptors it cannot exert its effects on cells and tissues. This severe resistance to the effects of insulin impairs blood sugar regulation and affects many aspects of development. "
684,IRAK4 ,interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 4,"The IRAK4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in innate immunity, which is the body's early, nonspecific response to foreign invaders (pathogens). The IRAK-4 protein is part of a signaling pathway that is involved in early recognition of pathogens and the initiation of inflammation to fight infection.In particular, the IRAK-4 protein relays signals from proteins called Toll-like receptors and IL-1 receptor-related proteins. As one of the first lines of defense against infection, Toll-like receptors recognize patterns that are common to many pathogens, rather than recognizing specific pathogens, and stimulate a quick immune response. The IL-1 receptor and related proteins recognize immune system proteins called cytokines that signal the need for an immune response. The resulting signaling pathway triggers inflammation, a nonspecific immune response that helps fight infection.","IRAK-4 deficiency At least 20 mutations in the IRAK4 gene have been identified in people with IRAK-4 deficiency, an immune system disorder that leads to recurrent invasive bacterial infections. These gene mutations lead to an abnormally short, nonfunctional IRAK-4 protein or no protein at all. The loss of functional IRAK-4 protein blocks the initiation of inflammation in response to pathogens or cytokines that would normally help fight the infections. Because the early immune response is insufficient, bacterial infections occur often and become severe and invasive. "
685,IRF5 ,interferon regulatory factor 5,"The protein produced from the IRF5 gene, called interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5), acts as a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of certain genes. When a virus is recognized in the cell, the IRF5 gene is turned on (activated), which leads to the production of IRF5 protein. The protein binds to specific regions of DNA that regulate the activity of genes that produce interferons and other cytokines. Cytokines are proteins that help fight infection by promoting inflammation and regulating the activity of immune system cells. In particular, interferons control the activity of genes that help block the replication of viruses, and they stimulate the activity of certain immune system cells known as natural killer cells.","Systemic scleroderma Several normal variations in the IRF5 gene have been associated with an increased risk of developing systemic scleroderma, which is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis) in the skin and internal organs. Although the IRF5 gene is known to stimulate the immune system in response to viruses, it is unknown how the gene variations contribute to the increased risk of systemic scleroderma. Researchers believe that a combination of genetic and environmental factors may play a role in development of the condition. "
686,IRF6 ,interferon regulatory factor 6,"The IRF6 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in early development. This protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes.The IRF6 protein is active in cells that give rise to tissues in the head and face. It is also involved in the development of other parts of the body, including the skin and genitals.","Popliteal pterygium syndrome Mutations in the IRF6 gene that cause popliteal pterygium syndrome may change the transcription factor's effects on the activity of certain genes. This affects the development and maturation of tissues in the face, skin, and genitals, resulting in the facial and genital abnormalities, skin webbing, and fusion of the fingers or toes (syndactyly) seen in popliteal pterygium syndrome. "
687,IRGM ,immunity related GTPase M,"The IRGM gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in the immune system. This protein is involved in a process called autophagy, which cells use to surround and destroy foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. Specifically, the IRGM protein helps trigger autophagy in cells infected with certain kinds of bacteria, including the type of bacteria that causes tuberculosis. In addition to protecting cells from infection, autophagy is used to recycle worn-out cell parts and break down certain proteins when they are no longer needed. This process also plays an important role in controlled cell death (apoptosis).","Crohn disease Several variations in or near the IRGM gene have been associated with an increased risk of developing Crohn disease. This increased risk has been found primarily in people of northern European ancestry. IRGM variations change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in regions of DNA that may regulate when and how the IRGM protein is produced. Researchers suspect that changes involving the IRGM protein may disrupt the autophagy process, preventing the immune system from destroying harmful bacteria effectively. An abnormal immune response to bacteria in the intestinal walls may lead to chronic inflammation and the digestive problems characteristic of Crohn disease. "
688,ISCU ,iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme,"The ISCU gene provides instructions for making a protein called the iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme. As its name suggests, this enzyme is involved in the formation of clusters of iron and sulfur atoms (Fe-S clusters). Specifically, the enzyme acts as a platform, or scaffold, for the assembly of these clusters. Fe-S clusters are critical for the function of many different proteins, including those needed for DNA repair and the regulation of iron levels. Proteins containing Fe-S clusters are also necessary for energy production within mitochondria, which are the cell structures that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use.","Myopathy with deficiency of iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme At least two mutations in the ISCU gene have been found to cause myopathy with deficiency of iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme. The more common mutation, written as IVS5+382G>C, alters the way the gene's instructions are pieced together to produce the enzyme. Most affected individuals have this mutation in both copies of the ISCU gene in each cell. The other mutation, which has been identified in one family, replaces the amino acid glycine with the amino acid glutamate at position 50 in the enzyme (written as Gly50Glu or G50E). Affected individuals in this family have had the G50E mutation in one copy of the ISCU gene in each cell and the IVS5+382G>C mutation in the other copy of the gene. This combination of mutations causes a severe variant of the disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting.Mutations in the ISCU gene severely limit the amount of iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme that is made in cells. A shortage of this enzyme prevents the normal production of proteins that contain Fe-S clusters, which disrupts a variety of cellular activities. A reduction in the amount of iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme is particularly damaging to skeletal muscle cells. Within the mitochondria of these cells, a lack of this enzyme causes problems with energy production and an overload of iron. These defects lead to muscle weakness, pain, and the other features of myopathy with deficiency of iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme. "
689,ITGA2B ,integrin subunit alpha 2b,"The ITGA2B gene provides instructions for making one part, the alphaIIb subunit, of a receptor complex called integrin alphaIIb/beta3 (αIIbβ3), which is found on the surface of small cells called platelets. Platelets circulate in blood and are an essential component of blood clots. The alphaIIb subunit attaches (binds) to the beta3 subunit, which is produced from the ITGB3 gene, to form integrin αIIbβ3. It is estimated that 80,000 to 100,000 copies of integrin αIIbβ3 are present on the surface of each platelet.During clot formation, integrin αIIbβ3 binds to a protein called fibrinogen. Attachment of integrin αIIbβ3 from adjacent platelets to the same fibrinogen protein helps platelets cluster together (platelet cohesion) to form a blood clot. Blood clots protect the body after injury by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss. Integrin αIIbβ3 can also bind other proteins on platelets and in blood as well as proteins within the intricate lattice that forms in the space between cells (extracellular matrix) to ensure proper clot formation and promote wound healing.","Glanzmann thrombasthenia At least 200 mutations in the ITGA2B gene have been found to cause Glanzmann thrombasthenia, which is a rare bleeding disorder. The mutations that cause this disorder occur in both copies of the gene in each cell and impair the production or activity of the alphaIIb subunit, which disrupts the formation of functional integrin αIIbβ3. A shortage (deficiency) of functional integrin αIIbβ3 prevents sufficient binding of fibrinogen or other proteins, impairing the formation of blood clots. A lack of platelet cohesion leads to prolonged or spontaneous bleeding episodes experienced by people with Glanzmann thrombasthenia. "
690,ITGA6 ,integrin subunit alpha 6,"The ITGA6 gene provides instructions for making one part (the α6 subunit) of two proteins known as α6β4 integrin and α6β1 integrin. Integrins are a group of proteins that regulate the attachment of cells to one another (cell-cell adhesion) and to the surrounding network of proteins and other molecules (cell-matrix adhesion). Integrins also transmit chemical signals that regulate cell growth and the activity of certain genes.The α6β4 integrin protein is found primarily in epithelial cells, which are cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body. This protein plays a particularly important role in strengthening and stabilizing the skin. It is a component of hemidesmosomes, which are microscopic structures that anchor the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) to underlying layers. As part of a complex network of proteins in hemidesmosomes, α6β4 integrin helps to hold the layers of skin together.The other integrin made with the α6 subunit, α6β1 integrin, functions during the formation of organs and tissues before birth. The α6β1 integrin protein has not been as well studied as α6β4 integrin.","Epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric atresia At least five mutations in the ITGA6 gene have been found to cause epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric atresia (EB-PA). In addition to skin blistering, people with EB-PA are born with a life-threatening obstruction of the digestive tract called pyloric atresia. Mutations in the ITGA6 gene account for about 5 percent of all cases of EB-PA.The ITGA6 gene mutations responsible for EB-PA lead to a loss of functional α6β4 integrin. These mutations alter the normal structure and function of the α6 integrin subunit or prevent cells from producing enough of this subunit. The resulting shortage of functional α6β4 integrin causes cells in the epidermis to be fragile and easily damaged. Friction or other minor trauma can cause the skin layers to separate, leading to the widespread formation of blisters. It is less clear how mutations in the ITGA6 gene are related to pyloric atresia. "
691,ITGB2 ,integrin subunit beta 2,"The ITGB2 gene provides instructions for making one part (the β2 subunit) of at least four different proteins known as β2 integrins. The other subunit can be one of a variety of alpha (α) subunits that are produced from different genes. Integrins are a group of proteins that regulate the attachment of cells to one another (cell-cell adhesion) and to the surrounding network of proteins and other molecules (cell-matrix adhesion). Integrins also transmit signals that regulate cell growth and the activity of certain genes.Integrins that contain the β2 subunit are found embedded in the membrane that surrounds white blood cells (leukocytes). β2 integrins help leukocytes gather at sites of infection or injury, where they are needed to contribute to the immune response. β2 integrins recognize signs of inflammation and attach (bind) to proteins called ligands on the lining of blood vessels. This binding leads to linkage (adhesion) of the leukocyte to the blood vessel wall. Signaling through the β2 integrins triggers the transport of the attached leukocyte across the blood vessel wall to the site of infection or injury.","Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 At least 90 mutations in the ITGB2 gene have been found to cause leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1. This condition is characterized by severe, recurrent infections and delayed healing after injury. Many of the mutations that cause this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the β2 subunit and lead to the production of a β2 subunit that cannot bind with other subunits to form integrins. Rarely, defective β2 subunits are able to form integrins, but the integrins cannot bind ligands. Leukocytes that lack these integrins cannot attach to the blood vessel wall or cross the vessel wall to contribute to the immune response. As a result, there is a decreased response to injury and foreign invaders, such as bacteria and fungi, resulting in frequent infections, delayed wound healing, and other signs and symptoms of leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1. "
692,ITGB3 ,integrin subunit beta 3,"The ITGB3 gene provides instructions for making the beta3 subunit of a receptor protein called integrin alphaIIb/beta3 (αIIbβ3), which is found on the surface of small cells called platelets. Platelets circulate in blood and are an essential component of blood clots. The beta3 subunit attaches (binds) to the alphaIIb subunit, which is produced from the ITGA2B gene, to form integrin αIIbβ3. It is estimated that 80,000 to 100,000 copies of integrin αIIbβ3 are present on the surface of each platelet.During clot formation, integrin αIIbβ3 binds to a protein called fibrinogen. Attachment of integrin αIIbβ3 from adjacent platelets to the same fibrinogen protein helps platelets cluster together (platelet cohesion) to form a blood clot. Blood clots protect the body after injury by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss. Integrin αIIbβ3 can also bind other proteins on platelets and in the blood as well as proteins within the intricate lattice that forms in the space between cells (extracellular matrix) to ensure proper clot formation and promote wound healing.","Glanzmann thrombasthenia At least 130 mutations in the ITGB3 gene have been found to cause Glanzmann thrombasthenia, which is a rare bleeding disorder. The mutations that cause this disorder occur in both copies of the gene in each cell and impair the production or activity of the beta3 subunit, which disrupts the formation of functional integrin αIIbβ3. A shortage (deficiency) of functional integrin αIIbβ3 prevents sufficient binding of fibrinogen or other proteins, impairing the formation of blood clots. A lack of platelet cohesion leads to prolonged or spontaneous bleeding episodes experienced by people with Glanzmann thrombasthenia. "
693,ITGB4 ,integrin subunit beta 4,"The ITGB4 gene provides instructions for making one part (the β4 subunit) of a protein known as an integrin. Integrins are a group of proteins that regulate the attachment of cells to one another (cell-cell adhesion) and to the surrounding network of proteins and other molecules (cell-matrix adhesion). Integrins also transmit chemical signals that regulate cell growth and the activity of certain genes.The integrin protein made with the β4 subunit is known as α6β4 integrin. This protein is found primarily in epithelial cells, which are cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body. The α6β4 integrin protein plays a particularly important role in strengthening and stabilizing the skin. It is a component of hemidesmosomes, which are microscopic structures that anchor the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) to underlying layers. As part of a complex network of proteins in hemidesmosomes, α6β4 integrin helps to hold the layers of skin together.","Epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric atresia At least 60 mutations in the ITGB4 gene have been found to cause epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric atresia (EB-PA). In addition to skin blistering, people with EB-PA are born with a life-threatening obstruction of the digestive tract called pyloric atresia. Mutations in the ITGB4 gene account for about 80 percent of all cases of EB-PA.ITGB4 gene mutations alter the normal structure and function of the β4 integrin subunit or prevent cells from producing enough of this subunit. As a result, α6β4 integrin is defective or missing. Mutations that lead to a complete or near-complete loss of α6β4 integrin tend to cause more severe signs and symptoms of EB-PA, while mutations that alter the structure or stability of this protein usually cause milder signs and symptoms. A shortage of functional α6β4 integrin causes cells in the epidermis to be fragile and easily damaged. Friction or other minor trauma can cause the skin layers to separate, leading to the widespread formation of blisters. It is less clear how mutations in the ITGB4 gene are related to pyloric atresia. "
694,ITM2B ,integral membrane protein 2B,"The ITM2B gene provides instructions for producing a protein called the integral membrane protein 2B (ITM2B), which is found in all tissues. The function of the ITM2B protein is unclear. It is thought to play a role in triggering the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis) and in keeping cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way (suppressing tumor formation). Additionally, the ITM2B protein may be involved in processing the amyloid precursor protein, which is produced by the APP gene. Not much is known about amyloid precursor protein function, but it is thought to be involved in nerve cell function in the brain in early development. Processing this protein creates different forms of the protein that can carry out various functions. Research suggests that the ITM2B protein is also involved in preventing (inhibiting) a form of the amyloid precursor protein from accumulating in the body's cells and tissues.","Hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy Two mutations in the ITM2B gene have been found to cause a condition called hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy. When this condition is caused by mutations in the ITM2B gene, it is characterized by movement problems and a decline in intellectual function (dementia). ITM2B gene mutations cause two forms of the condition called familial British dementia and familial Danish dementia, named for the regions where the conditions were first diagnosed. The ITM2B gene mutation that causes the British type results in the production of a protein that is longer than normal. The ITM2B protein normally has a stop signal that indicates where to stop the protein sequence so that all the ITM2B proteins that are made are the same. The mutation that causes the British type changes the stop signal so that more length is added to the protein. This mutation is written as Ter267Arg or X267R. The mutation that causes the Danish type is similar, but instead of changing the stop signal, extra pieces of DNA are added to the gene, which means that the protein is longer. This mutation is written as 795-796insTTTAATTTGT.The ITM2B gene mutations that cause the British type or the Danish type produce elongated proteins, known as ABri or ADan respectively, with altered 3-dimensional shapes that tend to cluster together (aggregate). These aggregated proteins form clumps called amyloid deposits, which accumulate in specific areas of the brain and in its blood vessels. The amyloid deposits, known as plaques, trigger activation of the complement system, which is a group of immune system proteins that work together to destroy pathogens, trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. Other immune system reactions are also activated, which all attack the area surrounding the deposit. The complement system and other reactions lead to cell death and tissue damage in various parts of the brain. These abnormalities underlie the signs and symptoms of the familial British dementia and familial Danish dementia types of hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy. "
695,ITPKC ,inositol-trisphosphate 3-kinase C,"The ITPKC gene provides instructions for making one version (isoform) of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase (ITPK) enzyme. This enzyme helps add a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) to a molecule called Ins(1,4,5)P3 to produce a molecule called Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. Both of these molecules are involved in regulating the amount of calcium in cells.Several versions (isoforms) of the ITPK enzyme are produced from different genes. They play a variety of roles in processes throughout the body. The isoform produced from the ITPKC gene is called inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase C (ITPKC). It is involved in a mechanism called the Ca(2+)/NFAT signaling pathway, which is affected by calcium levels. This pathway helps limit the activity of immune system cells called T cells. T cells identify foreign substances and defend the body against infection. Reducing the activity of T cells when appropriate prevents the overproduction of immune proteins called cytokines that lead to inflammation and which, in excess, cause tissue damage.","Kawasaki disease A variation in the ITPKC gene has been associated with an increased risk of Kawasaki disease, a sudden and time-limited (acute) illness affecting infants and children resulting in prolonged fever, inflammation, and other signs and symptoms. The variation changes a single DNA building block (nucleotide) in a region of the gene known as intron 1. It appears to reduce the efficiency of ITPKC gene transcription, which is the first step in producing the ITPKC enzyme. Researchers suggest that the variation may reduce the amount of ITPKC enzyme and interfere with the body's ability to limit T cell activity, leading to inflammation that damages blood vessels and results in the signs and symptoms of Kawasaki disease. "
696,ITPR1 ,"inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1","The ITPR1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of a channel that controls the flow of positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) within cells. Four ITPR1 protein molecules join together in a complex (a homotetramer) to form the channel. In response to certain signals, the ITPR1 channel releases calcium ions from storage in a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum into the surrounding cell fluid (the cytoplasm). Proper regulation of calcium ion concentration inside cells is important for the development and function of various tissues and organs.","Gillespie syndrome At least 13 ITPR1 gene mutations have been identified in people with Gillespie syndrome, a disorder that involves eye abnormalities, weak muscle tone from birth (congenital hypotonia), problems with balance and coordinating movements (ataxia), and mild to moderate intellectual disability. The ITPR1 gene mutations that cause Gillespie syndrome likely result in a protein with an altered structure. It is thought that calcium channel homotetramers made with the altered proteins are unstable. A shortage of normal ITPR1 channels impairs the cell's ability to regulate the concentration of calcium ions. However, the specific connection between these changes and the signs and symptoms of Gillespie syndrome is unclear. "
697,IVD ,isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase,"The IVD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase. This enzyme plays an essential role in processing proteins obtained from the diet. Normally, the body breaks down proteins from food into smaller parts called amino acids. Amino acids can be further processed to provide energy for growth and development. In cells throughout the body, isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase is found within specialized structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria convert energy from food to a form that cells can use.Isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase helps process a particular amino acid called leucine. Specifically, this enzyme is responsible for the third step in the breakdown of leucine. This step is a chemical reaction that converts a molecule called isovaleryl-CoA to another molecule, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA. Additional chemical reactions convert 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA into molecules that are used for energy.","Isovaleric acidemia At least 25 mutations in the IVD gene have been identified in people with isovaleric acidemia. Some of these mutations disrupt the normal function of the enzyme, while other mutations prevent the cell from producing any functional enzyme. As a result, the body is unable to break down leucine properly. Defects in leucine processing allow several potentially harmful substances, including a compound called isovaleric acid, to build up to toxic levels in the body. An accumulation of isovaleric acid causes people with isovaleric acidemia to have a characteristic odor of sweaty feet. The buildup of isovaleric acid and related compounds also damages the brain and nervous system, leading to poor feeding, lack of energy (lethargy), seizures, and the other signs and symptoms of isovaleric acidemia. "
698,JAG1 ,jagged 1,"The JAG1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called Jagged-1, which is involved in an important pathway by which cells can signal to each other. The Jagged-1 protein is inserted into the membranes of certain cells. It connects with other proteins called Notch receptors, which are bound to the membranes of adjacent cells. These proteins fit together like a lock and its key. When a connection is made between the Jagged-1 and Notch proteins, it launches a series of signaling reactions (Notch signaling) affecting cell functions. Notch signaling controls how certain types of cells develop in a growing embryo, especially cells destined to be part of the heart, liver, eyes, ears, and spinal column. The Jagged-1 protein continues to play a role throughout life in the development of new blood cells.","Alagille syndrome At least 226 mutations in the JAG1 gene have been identified in people with Alagille syndrome. Most of these mutations result in an abnormally short Jagged-1 protein that is missing the segment that normally spans the cell membrane (the transmembrane domain). Other mutations interfere with proper transport (trafficking) of the protein within the cell, preventing it from reaching the cell membrane. The loss of Jagged-1 protein at the cell membrane precludes its interaction with Notch proteins and prevents cell signaling. The lack of Notch signaling causes errors in development that result in missing or narrowed bile ducts in the liver, heart defects, distinctive facial features, and changes in other parts of the body. People with JAG1 gene mutations may have one or more of these problems. In particular, some affected individuals have a particular combination of heart defects known as tetralogy of Fallot without other signs or symptoms of Alagille syndrome. The type and severity of problems associated with Alagille syndrome may differ even within the same family. "
699,JAK2 ,Janus kinase 2,"The JAK2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that promotes the growth and division (proliferation) of cells. This protein is part of a signaling pathway called the JAK/STAT pathway, which transmits chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. The JAK2 protein is especially important for controlling the production of blood cells from hematopoietic stem cells. These stem cells are located within the bone marrow and have the potential to develop into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.",Crohn disease Genetics Home Reference provides information about Crohn disease. 
700,JAK3 ,Janus kinase 3,"The JAK3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is critical for the normal development and function of the immune system. The JAK3 protein is part of a signaling pathway called the JAK/STAT pathway, which transmits chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. Signals relayed by the JAK3 protein regulate the growth and maturation of certain types of white blood cells (lymphocytes) called T cells and natural killer cells. In addition, JAK3 is important for the normal maturation of another type of lymphocyte called B cells. T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells attack bacteria, viruses, and fungi and help regulate the entire immune system.","JAK3-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency More than 50 JAK3 gene mutations have been identified in people with JAK3-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), an impairment of the immune system that leads to repeated and persistent infections that can be life-threatening.Most mutations in the JAK3 gene prevent the production of JAK3 protein or result in a protein that is unstable and quickly broken down. Others lead to production of a protein that cannot perform its function. Without functional JAK3 protein, certain chemical signals are not relayed to the nucleus, impairing lymphocyte growth and development. As a result, individuals with JAK3-deficient SCID have few or no T cells and natural killer cells and a normal number of poorly functioning B cells. The shortage of functional lymphocytes causes people with this condition to be susceptible to infections. "
701,JPH3 ,junctophilin 3,"The JPH3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called junctophilin-3, which is found primarily in the brain. Although the exact function of this protein is unclear, researchers believe that it plays a role in the formation of a structure called the junctional membrane complex. This complex connects certain channels inside cells with other channels at the cell surface. The junctional membrane complex appears to be involved in the release of charged calcium atoms (calcium ions), which are critical for transmitting signals within cells. As part of the junctional membrane complex, junctophilin-3 is probably involved in signaling within and between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain.One region of the JPH3 gene contains a particular DNA segment known as a CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (nucleotides) that appear multiple times in a row. Normally, the CAG/CTG segment is repeated 6 to 28 times within the gene.","Huntington disease-like syndrome A particular type of mutation in the JPH3 gene has been found to cause signs and symptoms that resemble those of Huntington disease, including uncontrolled movements, emotional problems, and loss of thinking ability. Researchers have named this condition Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2).The mutation associated with HDL2 increases the size of the CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeat in the JPH3 gene. People with this condition have 44 to 59 CAG/CTG repeats. People with 29 to about 43 CAG/CTG repeats may or may not develop the signs and symptoms of HDL2.Researchers are working to determine the effects of the abnormally large CAG/CTG segment. They believe that the mutated JPH3 gene produces an altered version of messenger RNA, which is a molecular blueprint of the gene that is normally used for protein production. The abnormal messenger RNA forms clumps inside neurons that interfere with the normal functions of these cells. The dysfunction and eventual death of neurons in certain areas of the brain underlie the signs and symptoms of HDL2. "
702,JUP ,junction plakoglobin,"The JUP gene provides instructions for making a protein called plakoglobin. This protein is found primarily in cells of the heart and skin, where it is part of two specialized structures called adherens junctions and desmosomes. Both of these structures help hold neighboring cells together, which provides strength and stability to tissues. Desmosomes may also be involved in other critical cell functions, including chemical signaling pathways, the process by which cells mature to perform specific functions (differentiation), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).Studies suggest that plakoglobin also plays a role in signaling within cells as part of the Wnt pathway. Wnt signaling controls the activity of certain genes and regulates the interactions between cells. This signaling pathway is involved in many aspects of development, including the normal development of the heart, skin, and hair.",Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy Genetics Home Reference provides information about arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. 
703,KANK2 ,KN motif and ankyrin repeat domains 2,"The KANK2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called SRC-interacting protein (SIP). SIP regulates proteins called steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs), which play critical roles in turning on (activating) certain genes. Within cells, SIP attaches (binds) to SRCs in the fluid surrounding the nucleus (the cytoplasm). By holding SRCs in the cytoplasm, SIP prevents these proteins from entering the nucleus to activate genes. In this way, SIP helps to control gene activity.SIP is found in many organs and tissues, including the skin and kidneys. Little is known about its specific roles in various parts of the body.","Keratoderma with woolly hair At least one mutation in the KANK2 gene has been found to cause a form of keratoderma with woolly hair classified as type IV. It is characterized by thick, calloused skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (palmoplantar keratoderma); coarse, dry, fine, tightly curled, and sparse scalp hair; and abnormal fingernails and toenails. Unlike other forms of keratoderma with woolly hair, type IV does not appear to cause heart disease.The identified mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in SIP, replacing the amino acid alanine with the amino acid valine at position 670 (written as Ala670Val or A670V). Researchers predict that this mutation affects a region of SIP that is critical for its interaction with SRCs, which would ultimately lead to changes in gene activity. However, it is unclear how this mutation affects growth of the hair and skin, or why its effects appear to be limited to these tissues. "
704,KANSL1 ,KAT8 regulatory NSL complex subunit 1,"The KANSL1 gene provides instructions for making a member (subunit) of a group of interacting proteins called the KAT8 regulatory NSL complex. This complex is categorized as a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex. It helps regulate gene activity (expression) by modifying chromatin, the complex of DNA and protein that packages DNA into chromosomes.The protein produced from the KANSL1 gene is found in most organs and tissues of the body before birth and throughout life. By its involvement in controlling the activity of other genes, this protein plays an important role in the development and function of many parts of the body.","Koolen-de Vries syndrome KANSL1 gene mutations or deletions of genetic material including this gene cause Koolen-de Vries syndrome. This disorder is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, a cheerful and sociable disposition, and a variety of physical abnormalities.Loss of one copy of the KANSL1 gene in each cell impairs normal development and function of various organs and tissues of the body, but the relationship of KANSL1 gene loss to the specific signs and symptoms of Koolen-de Vries syndrome is unclear. "
705,KAT6B ,lysine acetyltransferase 6B,"The KAT6B gene provides instructions for making a type of enzyme called a histone acetyltransferase. These enzymes modify histones, which are structural proteins that attach (bind) to DNA and give chromosomes their shape. By adding a small molecule called an acetyl group to particular locations on histones, histone acetyltransferases control the activity of certain genes.Little is known about the function of the histone acetyltransferase produced from the KAT6B gene. It is active in cells and tissues throughout the body, where it interacts with many other proteins. It appears to regulate genes that are important for early development, including development of the skeleton and nervous system.","Genitopatellar syndrome At least eight mutations in the KAT6B gene have been identified in people with genitopatellar syndrome, a rare condition characterized by genital abnormalities, missing or underdeveloped kneecaps (patellae), intellectual disability, and abnormalities affecting other parts of the body. The mutations that cause genitopatellar syndrome occur near the end of the KAT6B gene in a region known as exon 18. These mutations lead to the production of a shortened histone acetyltransferase enzyme. Researchers suspect that the shortened enzyme may function differently than the full-length version, altering the regulation of various genes during early development. Because the altered enzyme takes on a different function, these mutations are described as ""gain-of-function."" However, it is unclear how these changes lead to the specific features of genitopatellar syndrome. "
706,KCNA1 ,potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 1,"The KCNA1 gene belongs to a large family of genes that provide instructions for making potassium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged atoms (ions) of potassium into and out of cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.The KCNA1 gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha subunit) of a potassium channel called Kv1.1. These channels are found in the brain, where they transport potassium ions into nerve cells (neurons). The flow of certain ions, including potassium, into and out of neurons regulates communication between these cells.","Episodic ataxia At least 20 mutations in the KCNA1 gene have been identified in people with episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1). People with this form of the condition have brief, recurrent episodes of poor coordination and balance (ataxia). Between episodes, many affected individuals experience myokymia, a muscle abnormality that can cause involuntary muscle cramping, stiffness, and continuous, fine muscle twitching that appears as rippling under the skin.Most of the KCNA1 mutations responsible for episodic ataxia change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the alpha subunit of the Kv1.1 channel. Some of these changes prevent the assembly of functional channels, while other mutations alter the channel's structure. When Kv1.1 channels are missing or abnormal, the flow of potassium ions into neurons is reduced. This decrease in potassium ions overexcites certain neurons in the brain, which disrupts normal communication between these cells. Although changes in signaling between neurons underlie the episodes of uncoordinated movement seen in people with episodic ataxia, it is unclear how altered potassium ion transport causes the specific features of the condition. "
707,KCNE1 ,potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E regulatory subunit 1,"The KCNE1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that regulates the activity of potassium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged potassium atoms (ions) into and out of cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.The specific function of a potassium channel depends on its protein components and its location in the body. The KCNE1 protein regulates a channel made up of four parts, called alpha subunits, which are produced from the KCNQ1 gene. One beta subunit, produced from the KCNE1 gene, binds to the channel and regulates its activity.These channels are active in the inner ear and in heart (cardiac) muscle, where they transport potassium ions out of cells. In the inner ear, the channels play a role in maintaining the proper ion balance needed for normal hearing. In the heart, the channels are involved in recharging the cardiac muscle after each heartbeat to maintain a regular rhythm. The KCNE1 protein is also produced in the kidneys, testes, and uterus, where it probably regulates the activity of other channels.","Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome At least four mutations in the KCNE1 gene have been identified in people with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome, a condition that causes an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) and profound hearing loss from birth. About 10 percent of cases are caused by mutations in this gene. Affected people typically have mutations in both copies of the KCNE1 gene in each cell. These mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the KCNE1 protein, which disrupts the protein's normal structure. An altered KCNE1 protein cannot regulate the flow of potassium ions through channels in the inner ear and cardiac muscle. This loss of channel function leads to the arrhythmia and hearing loss characteristic of Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. "
708,KCNH2 ,potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2,"The KCNH2 gene belongs to a large family of genes that provide instructions for making potassium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged atoms (ions) of potassium out of cells, play key roles in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.The specific function of a potassium channel depends on its protein components and its location in the body. Channels made with KCNH2 proteins (also known as hERG1) are active in heart (cardiac) muscle. They are involved in recharging the cardiac muscle after each heartbeat to maintain a regular rhythm. The KCNH2 protein is also produced in nerve cells and certain immune cells (microglia) in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).The proteins produced from the KCNH2 gene and another gene, KCNE2, interact to form a functional potassium channel. Four alpha subunits, each produced from the KCNH2 gene, form the structure of each channel. One beta subunit, produced from the KCNE2 gene, attaches (binds) to the channel and regulates its activity.","Romano-Ward syndrome Mutations in the KCNH2 gene can cause Romano-Ward syndrome, which is the most common form of a heart condition called long QT syndrome. Mutations in this gene account for approximately 25 percent of cases of Romano-Ward syndrome. In individuals with this condition, the heart muscle takes longer than usual to recharge between beats, which can lead to an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia).More than 900 KCNH2 gene mutations that cause Romano-Ward syndrome have been identified. Some of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the KCNH2 protein, while other mutations delete several amino acids from the protein. These changes prevent the protein from assembling into ion channels or alter the channels' structure or function. As a result, the channels cannot properly regulate the flow of potassium ions in cardiac muscle cells. The reduced ion transport alters the transmission of electrical signals in the heart, increasing the risk of an irregular heartbeat that can cause fainting (syncope) or sudden death. "
709,KCNJ1 ,potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily J member 1,"The KCNJ1 gene belongs to a large family of genes that produce potassium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged atoms (ions) of potassium into and out of cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.The specific function of a potassium channel depends on its protein components and its location in the body. Channels made with the KCNJ1 protein, also known as ROMK, are predominantly found in the kidneys. ROMK is one of several proteins that work together to regulate the movement of ions into and out of kidney cells. In particular, the transport of potassium ions by ROMK is necessary for the normal function of another ion transporter called NKCC2 (which is produced from the SLC12A1 gene). This transporter plays an essential role in the reabsorption of salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) from the urine back into the bloodstream. The retention of salt affects the body's fluid levels and helps maintain blood pressure.","Bartter syndrome Several dozen mutations in the KCNJ1 gene have been identified in people with Bartter syndrome type II. This form of the disorder causes severe or life-threatening health problems that become apparent before or soon after birth.Some of the KCNJ1 gene mutations responsible for Bartter syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ROMK protein. These mutations prevent the protein from reaching the cell membrane or alter the channel's ability to transport potassium ions. Other mutations in the KCNJ1 gene delete amino acids from the protein or lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of ROMK.A loss of functional ROMK affects the normal activity of the NKCC2 protein, preventing it from transporting ions into kidney cells. As a result, the kidneys cannot reabsorb salt normally and excess salt is lost through the urine (salt wasting). The abnormal salt loss disrupts the normal balance of sodium, potassium, and other ions in the body. These imbalances underlie the major features of Bartter syndrome. "
710,KCNJ2 ,potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily J member 2,"The KCNJ2 gene belongs to a large family of genes that provide instructions for making potassium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged potassium ions out of cells, play key roles in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.The specific function of a potassium channel depends on its protein components and its location in the body. Channels made with the KCNJ2 protein are active in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles) and in heart (cardiac) muscle. In skeletal muscle, these channels play an important role in the pattern of muscle tensing (contraction) and relaxation that allows the body to move. In the heart, the channels are involved in recharging the cardiac muscle after each heartbeat to maintain a regular rhythm. Channels formed with the KCNJ2 protein may also be involved in bone development, but their role in this process is unclear.Researchers have determined that a molecule called PIP2 must attach (bind) to channels made with the KCNJ2 protein for the channels to function normally. PIP2 activates the ion channel and helps it stay open, which allows ions to flow across the cell membrane.","Andersen-Tawil syndrome More than 60 mutations in the KCNJ2 gene have been found to cause Andersen-Tawil syndrome, a disorder characterized by episodes of muscle weakness (periodic paralysis), changes in heart rhythm (arrhythmia), and physical abnormalities affecting the face, other parts of the head, and the limbs. Most of the mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the KCNJ2 protein.Mutations in the KCNJ2 gene lead to the production of a nonfunctional potassium channel. Some mutations change the shape of the channel so it cannot transport potassium ions, while other mutations prevent the channels from being inserted correctly into the cell membrane. Many KCNJ2 mutations prevent PIP2 from effectively binding to and activating potassium channels. If the KCNJ2 protein is unable to bind to PIP2, the channels remain closed and potassium ions are unable to flow across the cell membrane. Researchers believe that problems with PIP2 binding are a major cause of Andersen-Tawil syndrome.A loss of this channel's function in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells disrupts the normal flow of potassium ions out of these cells, resulting in periodic paralysis and an irregular heart rhythm. It is not known how mutations in the KCNJ2 gene contribute to the physical abnormalities often found in Andersen-Tawil syndrome. "
711,KCNJ5 ,potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily J member 5,"The KCNJ5 gene provides instructions for making a protein that functions as a potassium channel, which means that it transports positively charged atoms (ions) of potassium (K+) into and out of cells. Potassium channels produced from the KCNJ5 gene are found in several tissues, including the adrenal glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. In these glands, the flow of ions creates an electrical charge across the cell membrane, which affects the triggering of certain biochemical processes that regulate aldosterone production. Aldosterone helps control blood pressure by maintaining proper salt and fluid levels in the body.","Aldosterone-producing adenoma Mutations in the KCNJ5 gene cause about 40 percent of aldosterone-producing adenomas, which are noncancerous (benign) tumors that form in the adrenal glands. The genetic changes involved in these tumors, called somatic mutations, are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in adrenal gland cells that give rise to the tumor.KCNJ5 gene mutations associated with this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the potassium channel. The altered potassium channels are less selective, allowing other ions, particularly sodium, to pass through. The flow of sodium ions into adrenal gland cells affects the electrical charge across the cell membrane, activating another type of channel that allows calcium ions to enter. The influx of calcium ions overactivates a process called the calcium/calmodulin pathway that increases aldosterone production, resulting in excess aldosterone and leading to high blood pressure (hypertension) and an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Overactivation of the calcium/calmodulin pathway in the adrenal glands also increases cell growth and division (proliferation), which promotes adenoma formation. "
712,KCNJ11 ,potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily J member 11,"The KCNJ11 gene provides instructions for making parts (subunits) of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channel. Each K-ATP channel consists of eight subunits. Four subunits are produced from the KCNJ11 gene, and four are produced from another gene called ABCC8.K-ATP channels are found in beta cells, which are cells in the pancreas that secrete the hormone insulin. The K-ATP channels are embedded in cell membranes, where they open and close in response to the amount of glucose in the bloodstream. Glucose is a simple sugar and the primary energy source for most cells in the body. Closure of the K-ATP channels in response to increased glucose triggers the release of insulin out of beta cells and into the bloodstream, which helps control blood sugar levels.","Congenital hyperinsulinism More than 30 mutations in the KCNJ11 gene have been found to cause congenital hyperinsulinism. This condition causes frequent episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), decreased energy, and irritability. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the protein sequence, reducing or preventing activity of the K-ATP channels. Loss of K-ATP channel function leads to the constant release of insulin from beta cells. As a result, glucose is rapidly removed from the bloodstream. Without treatment, the hypoglycemia caused by congenital hyperinsulinism may result in serious complications such as intellectual disability and seizures. "
713,KCNK9 ,potassium two pore domain channel subfamily K member 9,"The KCNK9 gene provides instructions for making a protein called TASK3, which functions as a potassium channel. Potassium channels transport positively charged atoms (ions) of potassium into and out of cells.TASK3 channels are found throughout the body. They are especially abundant in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain, particularly the region of the brain that coordinates movement (cerebellum). The flow of ions through potassium channels in neurons is involved in activating (exciting) the neurons and sending electrical signals in the brain. Unlike some potassium channels that open and close in response to certain triggers, TASK3 channels are always open, although their activity can be controlled by the environment surrounding the cell. Because the channels are always open, they are often called background or leak channels. TASK3 channels maintain the cell's ability to generate electrical signals and regulate the activity (excitability) of cells. These channels also appear to play a role in the movement (migration) of certain neurons in the brain.People inherit two copies of their genes, one from their mother and one from their father. Usually both copies of each gene are active, or ""turned on,"" in cells. For some genes, however, only one of the two copies is normally turned on. Which copy is active depends on the parent of origin: some genes are normally active only when they are inherited from a person's father; others are active only when inherited from a person's mother. This phenomenon is known as genomic imprinting. The KCNK9 gene is a maternally expressed imprinted gene, which means that only the copy of the gene that comes from the mother is active. The copy of the gene that comes from the father is turned off (silenced).","KCNK9 imprinting syndrome At least two changes in the KCNK9 gene, both of which have the same effect on the TASK3 channel protein, have been found to cause KCNK9 imprinting syndrome. This condition is characterized by weak muscle tone (hypotonia) from birth that can affect the ability to eat. Affected individuals typically have intellectual disability and delayed development of speech and motor skills, such as walking. Because the copy of the KCNK9 gene from the father is silenced, the condition occurs only when there is a mutation in the copy of the gene inherited from the mother.The gene mutations that cause KCNK9 imprinting syndrome change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the TASK3 channel; the amino acid arginine replaces the amino acid glycine at position 236 (written as Gly236Arg or G236R). This alteration reduces the flow of ions through TASK3 channels by 80 percent. Research suggests that certain neurons with altered TASK3 channels are unable to repeatedly generate electrical signals. The reduction of ion transport through TASK3 channels disrupts normal neuron development and excitability. Impairment of neuron function likely underlies the hypotonia, intellectual disability, and developmental problems characteristic of KCNK9 imprinting syndrome. "
714,KCNQ1 ,potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 1,"The KCNQ1 gene belongs to a large family of genes that provide instructions for making potassium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged atoms (ions) of potassium out of cells, play key roles in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.The specific function of a potassium channel depends on its protein components and its location in the body. Channels made with KCNQ1 proteins are primarily found in the inner ear and in heart (cardiac) muscle. In the inner ear, these channels help maintain the proper ion balance needed for normal hearing. In the heart, the channels are involved in recharging the cardiac muscle after each heartbeat to maintain a regular rhythm. The KCNQ1 protein is also produced in the kidney, lung, stomach, and intestine.The KCNQ1 protein interacts with proteins in the KCNE family (such as the KCNE1 protein) to form functional potassium channels. Four alpha subunits made from KCNQ1 proteins form the structure of each channel. One beta subunit, made from a KCNE protein, attaches (binds) to the channel and regulates its activity.","Familial atrial fibrillation Changes in the KCNQ1 gene are an uncommon cause of familial atrial fibrillation, a disruption of the heart's normal rhythm (arrhythmia) characterized by uncoordinated electrical activity in the heart's upper chambers (the atria). Several mutations have been found to cause the condition; these genetic changes alter single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the KCNQ1 protein. In cardiac muscle cells, the mutations appear to increase the flow of potassium ions through the channel formed with the KCNQ1 protein. The enhanced ion transport can disrupt the heart's normal rhythm, resulting in atrial fibrillation. "
715,KCNQ1OT1 ,KCNQ1 opposite strand/antisense transcript 1,"The KCNQ1OT1 gene is located within another gene, KCNQ1. Because the two genes share a region of overlapping DNA, the KCNQ1OT1 gene is also known as KCNQ1 overlapping transcript 1 or KCNQ1 opposite strand/antisense transcript 1. The DNA sequence of two genes is ""read"" in opposite directions, and the genes have very different functions. Unlike the KCNQ1 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein that acts as a potassium channel, the KCNQ1OT1 gene does not contain instructions for making a protein. Instead, a molecule called a noncoding RNA (a chemical cousin of DNA) is produced from the KCNQ1OT1 gene. This RNA helps regulate genes that are essential for normal growth and development before birth.People inherit one copy of most genes from their mother and one copy from their father. Both copies are typically active, or ""turned on,"" in cells. However, the activity of the KCNQ1OT1 gene depends on which parent it was inherited from. Only the copy inherited from a person's father (the paternally inherited copy) is active; the copy inherited from the mother (the maternally inherited copy) is not active. This sort of parent-specific difference in gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting.The KCNQ1OT1 gene is part of a cluster of genes on the short (p) arm of chromosome 11 that undergo genomic imprinting. KCNQ1OT1 and several other genes in this cluster that are thought to help regulate growth are controlled by a nearby region of DNA known as imprinting center 2 (IC2) or KvDMR. The IC2 region undergoes a process called methylation, which is a chemical reaction that attaches small molecules called methyl groups to certain segments of DNA. Methylation, which occurs during the formation of an egg or sperm cell, is a way of marking or ""stamping"" the parent of origin. The IC2 region is normally methylated only on the maternally inherited copy of chromosome 11.","Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition characterized by overgrowth and other signs and symptoms that affect many parts of the body. At least half of all cases of this condition result from changes in a process called methylation that affects the IC2 region. Specifically, the maternally inherited copy of the IC2 region has too few methyl groups attached (hypomethylation). This abnormality disrupts the regulation of several genes that are normally controlled by IC2. Hypomethylation of the IC2 region leads to an increase in the activity of the KCNQ1OT1 gene and a reduction in the activity of other nearby genes. Because some of these genes are involved in directing growth, a loss of their activity leads to overgrowth and the other features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.In a few cases, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome has been caused by deletions of a small amount of DNA from the maternally inherited copy of the IC2 region. Like abnormal methylation, these deletions disrupt the activity of several genes, including KCNQ1OT1. "
716,KCNQ2 ,potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 2,"The KCNQ2 gene belongs to a large family of genes that provide instructions for making potassium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged atoms (ions) of potassium into and out of cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.The specific function of a potassium channel depends on its protein components and its location in the body. Channels made with the KCNQ2 protein are active in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain, where they transport potassium ions out of cells. These channels transmit a particular type of electrical signal called the M-current, which prevents the neuron from continuing to send signals to other neurons. The M-current ensures that the neuron is not constantly active, or excitable.Potassium channels are made up of several protein components (subunits). Each channel contains four alpha subunits that form the hole (pore) through which potassium ions move. Four alpha subunits from the KCNQ2 gene can form a channel. However, the KCNQ2 alpha subunits can also interact with alpha subunits produced from the KCNQ3 gene to form a functional potassium channel, and these channels transmit a much stronger M-current.","Benign familial neonatal seizures A mutation in the KCNQ2 gene has been identified in most people with benign familial neonatal seizures (BFNS), a condition characterized by recurrent seizures (epilepsy) in newborn babies. The seizures begin around day 3 of life and usually go away within 1 to 4 months. More than 60 mutations in the KCNQ2 gene have been identified in families with this condition. Sometimes, the mutated protein never gets to the cell surface to form a channel, or the channel may be located in the wrong part of the neuron. Alternatively, the channel formed from the mutated protein may not function properly. As a result of these mutations, the M-current is reduced or altered, which leads to excessive excitability of neurons. Researchers believe that a reduction of the M-current by 25 percent is enough to cause BFNS. Seizures develop when neurons in the brain are abnormally excited. It is unclear why the seizures stop around the age of 4 months. It has been suggested that potassium channels formed from the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 proteins play a major role in preventing excessive excitability of neurons in newborns, but other mechanisms that prevent constant neuron activity develop during infancy.

717,KCNQ3 ,potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 3,"The KCNQ3 gene belongs to a large family of genes that provide instructions for making potassium channels.

The seizures begin around day 3 of life and usually go away within 1 to 4 months. At least three mutations have been identified in people with this condition, and these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the KCNQ3 protein. As a result of these mutations, the M-current is reduced. Researchers believe that a reduction of the current by 25 percent is enough to cause BFNS. A reduced M-current leads to excessive excitability of neurons, which is known to cause seizures. It is unclear why the seizures stop around the age of 4 months. It has been suggested that potassium channels formed from the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 proteins play a major role in preventing excessive excitability of neurons in newborns, but other mechanisms develop during infancy. "
718,KCNQ4 ,potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 4,"The KCNQ4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of a family of potassium channels. These channels transport positively charged potassium atoms (potassium ions) between neighboring cells. The channels play a key role in the ability of cells to generate and transmit electrical signals. The specific function of a potassium channel depends on its protein components and its location in the body. Potassium channels made with the KCNQ4 protein are found in certain cells of the inner ear and along part of the nerve pathway from the ear to the brain (the auditory pathway). To a lesser extent, KCNQ4 potassium channels are also found in the heart and some other muscles.Because KCNQ4 potassium channels are present in the inner ear and auditory pathway, researchers have focused on their role in hearing. Hearing requires the conversion of sound waves to electrical nerve signals, which are then transmitted to the brain. This conversion involves many processes, including maintenance of the proper levels of potassium ions in the inner ear. KCNQ4 channels help to maintain these levels, playing a critical role in the efficient transmission of electrical nerve signals from the inner ear to the brain.","Nonsyndromic hearing loss Several KCNQ4 gene mutations have been reported in individuals with nonsyndromic hearing loss, which is loss of hearing that is not associated with other signs and symptoms. Mutations in this gene cause a form of nonsyndromic hearing loss called DFNA2. This form of hearing loss generally begins after a child learns to speak (postlingual) and particularly affects the ability to hear high-frequency sounds. DFNA2 is described as progressive, which means it becomes more severe over time.Most KCNQ4 gene mutations change one of the building blocks (amino acids) used to make the KCNQ4 protein. Some mutations prevent the channel from reaching the cell membrane, where it is needed to transport potassium ions. Other mutations lead to the formation of abnormal channels that cannot transport these ions effectively. The loss of functional KCNQ4 channels appears to cause a buildup of potassium ions in certain cells of the inner ear, which damages those cells and leads to progressive hearing loss in people with DFNA2. "
719,KCNT1 ,potassium sodium-activated channel subfamily T member 1,"The KCNT1 gene belongs to a large family of genes that provide instructions for making potassium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged atoms (ions) of potassium into and out of cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.The specific function of a potassium channel depends on its protein components and its location in the body. Channels made with the KCNT1 protein are active in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain, where they transport potassium ions out of cells. This flow of ions is involved in generating currents to activate (excite) neurons and send signals in the brain.Potassium channels are made up of several protein components (subunits). Each channel contains four alpha subunits that form the hole (pore) through which potassium ions move. Four alpha subunits from the KCNT1 gene can form a channel. The KCNT1 alpha subunits can also interact with alpha subunits produced from the KCNT2 gene to form a functional potassium channel.Researchers have determined that a molecule called PKC can turn on channels made with the KCNT1 protein. While the channels can generate electrical currents without PKC, when PKC turns the channel on, the currents are stronger.","Malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy At least six KCNT1 gene mutations have been found in individuals with malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy (MMPSI). This condition is characterized by recurrent seizures beginning before the age of 6 months as well as profound developmental delay. In MMPSI, seizure activity in the brain can spread (migrate) from one region to another during an episode.The KCNT1 gene mutations involved in MMPSI change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the KCNT1 protein. The electrical currents generated by potassium channels made with the altered KCNT1 protein are abnormally increased, as though the channels were turned on by PKC. The increased electrical currents allow unregulated excitation of neurons in the brain. When neurons are abnormally excited, seizures develop. Repeated seizures contribute to the developmental delay that is characteristic of this condition. "
720,KCTD1 ,potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 1,"The KCTD1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that acts as a transcriptional repressor, which means that it turns off (represses) the activity of certain genes when they are not needed. A region of the KCTD1 protein called the BTB domain is essential for the protein's transcriptional repressor function.The KCTD1 protein is thought to control (regulate) the activity of genes involved in the development of an embryonic cell layer called the ectoderm. Within the developing embryo, the ectoderm gives rise to several body tissues including the skin, hair, nails, and teeth.","Scalp-ear-nipple syndrome At least 10 mutations in the KCTD1 gene have been identified in people with scalp-ear-nipple syndrome; as its name suggests, this condition is characterized by abnormalities of the scalp, ears, and nipples. The mutations associated with scalp-ear-nipple syndrome affect the BTB domain of the KCTD1 protein and impair its transcriptional repressor function. This impairment results in abnormal regulation of genes involved in ectodermal development. The altered gene activity disrupts normal development of the tissues that arise from the ectoderm (ectodermal dysplasia) and leads to the signs and symptoms of scalp-ear-nipple syndrome. "
721,KDM6A ,lysine demethylase 6A,"The KDM6A gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called lysine-specific demethylase 6A that is found in many organs and tissues of the body. Lysine-specific demethylase 6A functions as a histone demethylase. Histone demethylases are enzymes that modify proteins called histones. Histones are structural proteins that attach (bind) to DNA and give chromosomes their shape. By removing a molecule called a methyl group from histones (a process called demethylation), histone demethylases control (regulate) the activity of certain genes. Lysine-specific demethylase 6A appears to regulate certain genes that are important for development.Lysine-specific demethylase 6A is also believed to act as a tumor suppressor, which means it normally helps prevent cells from growing and dividing in an uncontrolled way.","Kabuki syndrome At least 35 mutations in the KDM6A gene have been identified in people with Kabuki syndrome, a disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, and abnormalities affecting other parts of the body.Most of the KDM6A gene mutations associated with Kabuki syndrome delete genetic material in the KDM6A gene sequence or result in a premature stop signal that leads to an abnormally short lysine-specific demethylase 6A enzyme. As a result of these mutations, the enzyme is nonfunctional. A lack of functional lysine-specific demethylase 6A enzyme disrupts its role in histone demethylation and impairs proper regulation of certain genes in many of the body's organs and tissues, resulting in the abnormalities of development and function characteristic of Kabuki syndrome.Although lysine-specific demethylase 6A is believed to act as a tumor suppressor, a loss of this enzyme's function does not seem to increase cancer risk in people with Kabuki syndrome. "
722,KHDC3L ,"KH domain containing 3 like, subcortical maternal complex member","The KHDC3L gene provides instructions for making a protein whose role is not known. The KHDC3L protein is thought to be involved in regulating gene activity (expression) through a phenomenon known as genomic imprinting. Through genomic imprinting, certain genes are turned off (inactivated) based on which parent the copy of the gene came from. For most genes, both copies of the gene (one copy inherited from each parent) are active in all cells. However, for a small subset of genes, only one of the two copies is active and the other is turned off. For some of these genes, the copy from the father is normally active, while for others, the copy from the mother is normally active.It is likely that the KHDC3L protein has additional roles in egg cell (oocyte) and embryonic development; however, its exact functions are unclear.","Recurrent hydatidiform mole At least six mutations in the KHDC3L gene have been found to cause a pregnancy-related condition known as recurrent hydatidiform mole. A hydatidiform mole is a mass that forms early in pregnancy and is made up of cells from an abnormally developed embryo and placenta. The placenta, a structure in the uterus that normally provides nutrients to a growing fetus, is dysfunctional and appears as numerous small sacs, often described as resembling a bunch of grapes. When a hydatidiform mole develops more than once, the condition is known as recurrent hydatidiform mole. KHDC3L gene mutations account for recurrent hydatidiform mole in about 5 percent of women with this condition.KHDC3L gene mutations result in the production of a protein with reduced function. As a result, oocytes do not develop normally. A pregnancy that results from an abnormal oocyte cannot develop properly, resulting in recurrent hydatidiform mole. KHDC3L gene mutations can also prevent proper imprinting of multiple genes that contribute to a developing embryo, leading to abnormal gene activity (expression). It is not clear if problems with imprinting also contribute to the development of a hydatidiform mole. In women with KHDC3L gene mutations, a hydatidiform mole will develop in every pregnancy that occurs with her egg cells. "
723,KIF1B ,kinesin family member 1B,"The KIF1B gene provides instructions for making a protein called kinesin family member 1B, part of the kinesin family of proteins. These proteins are essential for the transport of materials within cells. Kinesin proteins function like freight trains that transport cargo, and their structure is suited for this cargo-carrying function. One part of the protein, called the motor domain, provides the power to move the protein and its cargo along a track-like system made from structures called microtubules. Another part of the kinesin protein, which varies among members of this protein family, binds to specific materials for transport.Research suggests that the kinesin family member 1B protein specializes in carrying two types of cargo. In nerve cells (neurons), this protein transports small, sac-like structures called synaptic vesicles, which contain materials necessary for the transmission of nerve impulses. In other cell types, the kinesin family member 1B protein carries energy-producing structures called mitochondria.In addition to its transport functions, the kinesin family member 1B protein appears to be involved in programmed cell death (apoptosis). Apoptosis is a common process throughout life that helps the body get rid of cells it does not need.",Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Genetics Home Reference provides information about Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. 
724,KIF7 ,kinesin family member 7,"The KIF7 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is associated with structures called primary cilia. These microscopic, finger-like projections stick out from the surface of cells and are involved in signaling pathways that transmit information into cells. Studies suggest that the KIF7 protein helps to maintain the proper length and stability of cilia.Through its association with primary cilia, the KIF7 protein helps regulate a signaling pathway known as Sonic Hedgehog. This pathway is essential for early development. It plays roles in cell growth, cell specialization, and the normal shaping (patterning) of many parts of the body, including the brain and limbs.","Acrocallosal syndrome At least 20 mutations in the KIF7 gene have been identified in people with acrocallosal syndrome. This rare condition is characterized by certain brain abnormalities, the presence of extra fingers and toes (polydactyly), and distinctive facial features, including widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism) and a prominent forehead. Most of the KIF7 gene mutations that cause acrocallosal syndrome lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the KIF7 protein or prevent any protein from being produced from the gene. Little is known about the effects of these mutations, although they likely disrupt Sonic Hedgehog signaling during early development. It is unclear how these changes impair the development of the brain, limbs, and other parts of the body in people with acrocallosal syndrome. "
725,KIF21A ,kinesin family member 21A,"The KIF21A gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of the kinesin family. Many proteins in the kinesin family are essential for the transport of materials within cells. Kinesin proteins function like freight trains that transport cargo along a track-like system made from structures called microtubules. Some kinesins also help maintain microtubules. As well as functioning like a track, microtubules make up the structural framework of cells and help cells move.The KIF21A protein is found in nerve cells (neurons) and many other cell types. Researchers believe that this protein plays an important role in neuron development by helping control the growth of microtubules. By blocking microtubule growth at critical times, the KIF21A protein may help direct the path of neuron extensions known as axons so they can reach their correct locations. Once in the right position, axons relay messages to and from the brain to control muscle movement and detect sensations such as touch, pain, and heat.For proper neuron development, the KIF21A protein must be turned on and off at particular times. When a segment of the protein known as the regulatory region interacts with another segment of the protein known as the motor domain, the protein is turned off (which is known as autoinhibition).","Congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles At least 12 mutations in the KIF21A gene have been identified in people with congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles (CFEOM). These mutations cause the most common form of the disorder, CFEOM1, and are a rare cause of another form of the condition called CFEOM3. Individuals with CFEOM are unable to move their eyes normally. They have difficulty looking upward or, less commonly, side-to-side, and most also have droopy eyelids (ptosis). In addition, people with CFEOM3 can have intellectual disability or other neurological problems.Each of the known KIF21A gene mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the KIF21A protein. Most of these changes occur in the regulatory region of the protein. These mutations alter the protein's structure, which interferes with its ability to turn itself off. As a result, the KIF21A protein is always on (constitutively active) and cannot regulate microtubule growth. Without proper control of microtubule elongation, the axons of nerves develop abnormally and do not reach the muscles they control. Nerves in the head and face (cranial nerves) that control muscles that surround the eyes (extraocular muscles) are particularly affected. Problems with cranial nerve development impair extraocular muscle function, resulting in the characteristic features of CFEOM such as restricted eye movement and droopy eyelids. "
726,KIT ,KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase,"The KIT gene provides instructions for making a member of a protein family called receptor tyrosine kinases. Receptor tyrosine kinases transmit signals from the cell surface into the cell through a process called signal transduction. The KIT protein is found in the cell membrane of certain cell types where a specific protein, called stem cell factor, attaches (binds) to it. This binding turns on (activates) the KIT protein, which then activates other proteins inside the cell by adding a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) at specific positions. This process, called phosphorylation, leads to the activation of a series of proteins in multiple signaling pathways.The signaling pathways stimulated by the KIT protein control many important cellular processes such as cell growth and division (proliferation), survival, and movement (migration). KIT protein signaling is important for the development and function of certain cell types, including reproductive cells (germ cells), early blood cells (hematopoietic stem cells), white blood cells called mast cells, cells in the gastrointestinal tract called interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs), and cells called melanocytes. Melanocytes produce the pigment melanin, which contributes to hair, eye, and skin color.","Piebaldism At least 69 KIT gene mutations have been identified in people with piebaldism. This condition is characterized by white patches of skin and hair caused by a lack of melanocytes in those areas. The mutations responsible for piebaldism lead to a nonfunctional KIT protein. The loss of KIT signaling is thought to disrupt melanocyte migration and proliferation during development, resulting in patches of skin that lack pigmentation. "
727,KL ,klotho,"The KL gene provides instructions for making the protein alpha-klotho, which is found primarily in kidney cells. This protein plays a major role in regulating the phosphate levels within the body (phosphate homeostasis). Among its many functions, phosphate plays a critical role in the formation and growth of bones in childhood and helps maintain bone strength in adults. Phosphate levels are controlled in large part by the kidneys. The kidneys normally rid the body of excess phosphate by excreting it in urine, and they reabsorb this mineral into the bloodstream when more is needed.Alpha-klotho attaches (binds) to and turns on (activates) a protein called FGF receptor 1 that spans the membrane of many types of cells, including kidney cells. Once the receptor is active, another protein called fibroblast growth factor 23 can also bind to it. Binding of fibroblast growth factor 23 to its receptor stimulates signaling that stops phosphate reabsorption into the bloodstream.","Hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis At least one mutation in the KL gene has been found to cause hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis (HFTC), a condition characterized by an increase in the levels of phosphate in the blood (hyperphosphatemia) and abnormal deposits of phosphate and calcium (calcinosis) in the body's tissues. The KL gene mutation that causes HFTC replaces the protein building block (amino acid) histidine with the amino acid arginine at position 193 in the protein sequence (written as His193Arg or H193R). This mutation results in a shortage of functional alpha-klotho. As a result, FGF receptor 1 is not activated, making it unavailable for fibroblast growth factor 23 binding. The fibroblast growth factor 23 protein is normal, but it cannot bind to its receptor and cannot send out signals to stop phosphate reabsorption. As a result, too much phosphate is reabsorbed into the bloodstream, leading to hyperphosphatemia and subsequent calcinosis. "
728,KLHL3 ,kelch like family member 3,"The KLHL3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a role in the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unwanted proteins, called the ubiquitin-proteasome system.The KLHL3 protein is one piece of a complex known as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. E3 ubiquitin ligases function as part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system by tagging damaged and excess proteins with molecules called ubiquitin. Ubiquitin serves as a signal to specialized cell structures known as proteasomes, which attach (bind) to the tagged proteins and degrade them. The ubiquitin-proteasome system acts as the cell's quality control system by disposing of damaged, misshapen, and excess proteins. This system also regulates the level of proteins involved in several critical cell activities such as the timing of cell division and growth.The KLHL3 protein identifies the target of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and attaches the complex to it. Complexes containing the KLHL3 protein tag proteins called WNK1 and WNK4 with ubiquitin. The WNK1 and WNK4 proteins are involved in controlling blood pressure in the body. By regulating the amount of these proteins available, KLHL3 plays a role in blood pressure control.","Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 At least 36 KLHL3 gene mutations have been found to cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 (PHA2), a condition characterized by high blood pressure (hypertension) and high levels of potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia). These mutations alter the KLHL3 protein, impairing its ability to attach to the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex or to WNK4. As a result, the complex is unable to tag WNK4 with ubiquitin, and degradation of the protein is impaired. An excess of WNK4 disrupts normal control of blood pressure, leading to hypertension and the other features of PHA2. It is unknown if WNK1 is affected by the abnormal E3 ubiquitin ligase complex or whether WNK1 plays a role in development of PHA2 caused by KLHL3 gene mutations. "
729,KLKB1 ,kallikrein B1,"The KLKB1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called prekallikrein. Prekallikrein is produced in the liver and circulates in the blood. A molecule called factor XII converts prekallikrein to another protein called plasma kallikrein, and plasma kallikrein helps turn on (activate) more factor XII. Plasma kallikrein and factor XII are involved in the early stages of blood clotting as part of a process called the intrinsic coagulation pathway (also called the contact activation pathway). Blood clots protect the body after an injury by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss.The interaction between plasma kallikrein and factor XII also initiates a series of chemical reactions resulting in the release of a protein called bradykinin. Bradykinin promotes inflammation by increasing the permeability of blood vessel walls, allowing more fluids to leak into body tissues. This leakage causes the swelling that accompanies inflammation.","Prekallikrein deficiency At least nine KLKB1 gene mutations have been identified in people with a blood condition called prekallikrein deficiency, which does not generally cause any health problems. The condition is usually discovered when blood tests are done for other reasons.The KLKB1 gene mutations that cause this condition reduce or eliminate functional plasma kallikrein in the blood of affected individuals and likely impair the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Researchers suggest that this lack (deficiency) of functional plasma kallikrein protein does not generally cause any symptoms because another process called the extrinsic coagulation pathway (also known as the tissue factor pathway) can compensate for the impaired intrinsic coagulation pathway. Either pathway can activate proteins that are needed later in the clotting process. "
730,KLLN ,"killin, p53 regulated DNA replication inhibitor","The KLLN gene provides instructions for making a protein called killin. The activity of the KLLN gene is controlled by a protein called p53 (which is produced from the TP53 gene). Little is known about the function of killin, although it is thought to trigger cells to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis) when they are damaged or no longer needed. In this way, killin helps to prevent abnormal cells from growing and dividing unchecked to form tumors. Based on this role, killin is thought to be a tumor suppressor.","Cowden syndrome Some cases of Cowden syndrome and a similar condition called Cowden-like syndrome result from a change involving the KLLN gene. These conditions are characterized by multiple tumor-like growths called hamartomas and an increased risk of developing certain cancers. When Cowden syndrome and Cowden-like syndrome are caused by KLLN gene mutations, the conditions are associated with a particularly high risk of developing breast and kidney cancers.The genetic change associated with these conditions is known as promoter hypermethylation. The promoter is a region of DNA near the gene that controls gene activity (expression). Hypermethylation occurs when too many small molecules called methyl groups are attached to the promoter region. The extra methyl groups reduce the expression of the KLLN gene, which means that less killin is produced. A reduced amount of killin may allow abnormal cells to survive and proliferate inappropriately, which can lead to the formation of tumors.The promoter region of the KLLN gene is shared with another gene, PTEN. The single promoter controls the expression of both genes. However, it appears that promoter hypermethylation only affects the expression of the KLLN gene; people with this type of genetic change have normal expression of the PTEN gene. Other types of mutations in the PTEN gene can cause Cowden syndrome and Cowden-like syndrome. "
731,KMT2D ,lysine methyltransferase 2D,"The KMT2D gene, also known as MLL2, provides instructions for making an enzyme called lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D that is found in many organs and tissues of the body. Lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D functions as a histone methyltransferase. Histone methyltransferases are enzymes that modify proteins called histones. Histones are structural proteins that attach (bind) to DNA and give chromosomes their shape. By adding a molecule called a methyl group to histones (a process called methylation), histone methyltransferases control (regulate) the activity of certain genes. Lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D appears to activate certain genes that are important for development.Lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D is also believed to act as a tumor suppressor, which means it normally helps prevent cells from growing and dividing in an uncontrolled way.","Kabuki syndrome Hundreds of mutations in the KMT2D gene have been identified in people with Kabuki syndrome, a disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, and abnormalities affecting other parts of the body.The KMT2D gene mutations associated with Kabuki syndrome change one building block (amino acid) in the lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D enzyme, delete genetic material in the KMT2D gene sequence, or result in a premature stop signal that leads to an abnormally short enzyme. As a result of these mutations, the enzyme is nonfunctional. A lack of functional lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D enzyme disrupts its role in histone methylation and impairs proper activation of certain genes in many of the body's organs and tissues, resulting in the abnormalities of development and function characteristic of Kabuki syndrome.Although lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D is believed to be a tumor suppressor, a loss of this enzyme's function does not seem to increase cancer risk in people with Kabuki syndrome. "
732,KRAS ,"KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase","The KRAS gene provides instructions for making a protein called K-Ras that is part of a signaling pathway known as the RAS/MAPK pathway. The protein relays signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. These signals instruct the cell to grow and divide (proliferate) or to mature and take on specialized functions (differentiate). The K-Ras protein is a GTPase, which means it converts a molecule called GTP into another molecule called GDP. In this way the K-Ras protein acts like a switch that is turned on and off by the GTP and GDP molecules. To transmit signals, it must be turned on by attaching (binding) to a molecule of GTP. The K-Ras protein is turned off (inactivated) when it converts the GTP to GDP. When the protein is bound to GDP, it does not relay signals to the cell's nucleus.The KRAS gene belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous. The KRAS gene is in the Ras family of oncogenes, which also includes two other genes: HRAS and NRAS. These proteins play important roles in cell division, cell differentiation, and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).","Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome Mutations in the KRAS gene are an uncommon cause of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, accounting for less than 5 percent of cases. Several mutations in the KRAS gene have been identified in people with characteristic features of the disorder, which include heart defects, distinctive facial features, and skin abnormalities. These mutations are present in all of the body's cells and are known as germline mutations. The mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the K-Ras protein. The altered protein shows increased GTP binding and a decreased ability to convert GTP to GDP. These effects lead to prolonged activation of the K-Ras protein, which alters tightly regulated RAS/MAPK signaling during development. The altered signaling interferes with the development of organs and tissues throughout the body, leading to the varied signs and symptoms of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. "
733,KRIT1 ,"KRIT1, ankyrin repeat containing","The KRIT1 gene (also known as CCM1) provides instructions for making a protein that strengthens the interactions between cells that form blood vessels and limits leakage from the vessels. The KRIT1 protein interacts with a number of other proteins to form a complex that is found in the junctions that connect neighboring cells. As part of this complex, the KRIT1 protein helps turn off (suppress) a signaling molecule known as RhoA-GTPase. This molecule plays a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, which is a network of fibers that makes up the cell's structural framework. When turned on, RhoA-GTPase stimulates the formation of actin fibers, which has been linked to weakened junctions between cells and increased leakage from blood vessels.","Cerebral cavernous malformation More than 100 KRIT1 gene mutations have been identified in families with cerebral cavernous malformations, which are collections of blood vessels in the brain that are weak and prone to leakage. Virtually all of these mutations place a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the KRIT1 protein, preventing adequate KRIT1 protein production. A shortage of this protein likely impairs the function of the complex. As a result, RhoA-GTPase signaling is turned on abnormally, weakening cellular junctions and increasing the permeability of blood vessel walls. The increased leakage into the brain can cause health problems such as headaches, seizures, and bleeding in the brain (cerebral hemorrhage) in some people with cerebral cavernous malformations.Mutations in the KRIT1 gene account for up to 50 percent of all familial cerebral cavernous malformation cases. One particular mutation is responsible for up to 70 percent of cases in people of Hispanic heritage. This mutation changes a single DNA building block (nucleotide) at position 1363 in the KRIT1 gene, written as 1363C>T. "
734,KRT1 ,keratin 1,"The KRT1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin 1. Keratins are a group of tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of cells called keratinocytes that make up the skin, hair, and nails. Keratin 1 is produced in keratinocytes in the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis), including the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.The keratin 1 protein partners with another keratin protein, either keratin 9 or keratin 10, to form molecules called keratin intermediate filaments. These filaments assemble into strong networks that provide strength and resiliency to the skin and protect it from being damaged by friction and other everyday physical stresses.","Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis Dozens of mutations in the KRT1 gene have been found in people with epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. This condition is a skin disorder characterized by red, blistering skin at an early age and thick skin (hyperkeratosis) later in life. People with KRT1 gene mutations typically have PS-type epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, which features thick skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (palmoplantar hyperkeratosis) in addition to other parts of the body.Most KRT1 gene mutations associated with epidermolytic hyperkeratosis change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the keratin 1 protein. These amino acid changes commonly occur in regions of the protein that play a role in intermediate filament formation. The mutations alter the keratin 1 protein and seem to affect how intermediate filaments interact with each other to form networks. The altered proteins still form intermediate filaments, but the intermediate filament networks are weaker and do not function normally. Without a strong network, skin cells become fragile and are easily damaged, which can lead to blistering in response to friction or mild trauma. It is unclear how these mutations cause the overgrowth of keratinocytes that results in hyperkeratotic skin. "
735,KRT3 ,keratin 3,"The KRT3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin 3. Keratins are a group of tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of epithelial cells, which are cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body. Keratin 3 is produced in a tissue on the surface of the eye called the corneal epithelium. This tissue forms the outermost layer of the cornea, which is the clear front covering of the eye. The corneal epithelium acts as a barrier to help prevent foreign materials, such as dust and bacteria, from entering the eye.The keratin 3 protein partners with another keratin protein, keratin 12, to form molecules known as intermediate filaments. These filaments assemble into strong networks that provide strength and resilience to the corneal epithelium.","Meesmann corneal dystrophy At least three mutations in the KRT3 gene have been found to cause Meesmann corneal dystrophy, an eye disease characterized by the formation of tiny cysts in the corneal epithelium.All of the identified KRT3 gene mutations associated with Meesmann corneal dystrophy change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the keratin 3 protein. These changes occur in a region of the protein that is critical for the formation and stability of intermediate filaments. The altered keratin 3 protein interferes with the assembly of intermediate filaments, weakening the structural framework of the corneal epithelium. As a result, this outer layer of the cornea is abnormally fragile and develops the cysts that characterize Meesmann corneal dystrophy. The cysts likely contain clumps of abnormal keratin proteins and other cellular debris. When the cysts break open (rupture), they cause eye irritation, increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), and related symptoms. "
736,KRT4 ,keratin 4,"The KRT4 gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin 4. Keratins are a group of tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of epithelial cells, which are cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body. Keratin 4 is found in the moist lining (mucosae) of the mouth, nose, esophagus, genitals, and anus.Keratin 4 partners with a similar protein, keratin 13 (produced from the KRT13 gene), to form molecules known as intermediate filaments. These filaments assemble into strong networks that provide strength and resilience to the different mucosae. Networks of intermediate filaments protect the mucosae from being damaged by friction or other everyday physical stresses.","White sponge nevus At least six mutations in the KRT4 gene have been found to cause white sponge nevus, a condition that results in the formation of white patches of tissue called nevi (singular: nevus) that appear as thickened, velvety, sponge-like tissue. These nevi most often occur on the mouth (oral) mucosa (plural: mucosae). Rarely, white sponge nevus occurs on the mucosae of the nose, esophagus, genitals, or anus.The KRT4 gene mutations that cause white sponge nevus disrupt the structure of keratin 4. As a result, keratin 4 does not fit together properly with keratin 13, leading to the formation of irregular intermediate filaments that are easily damaged with little friction or trauma. Fragile intermediate filaments in the oral mucosa might be damaged when eating or brushing one's teeth. Damage to intermediate filaments leads to inflammation and promotes the abnormal growth and division (proliferation) of epithelial cells, causing the mucosae to thicken and resulting in white sponge nevus. "
737,KRT5 ,keratin 5,"The KRT5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin 5. Keratins are a group of tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of certain cells, particularly cells that make up the skin, hair, and nails. Keratin 5 is produced in cells called keratinocytes in the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis).Keratin 5 partners with a similar protein, keratin 14 (produced from the KRT14 gene), to form molecules called keratin intermediate filaments. These filaments assemble into strong networks that help attach keratinocytes together and anchor the epidermis to underlying layers of skin. The network of keratin intermediate filaments provides strength and resiliency to the skin and protects it from being damaged by friction and other everyday physical stresses.Researchers believe that keratin 5 interacts with pigment-producing cells called melanocytes to transport melanosomes, which are cellular structures within melanocytes that carry pigment called melanin. The transport of these structures from melanocytes to keratinocytes is important for the development of normal skin coloration (pigmentation).","Dowling-Degos disease At least five mutations in the KRT5 gene have been found to cause Dowling-Degos disease. This condition results in various skin abnormalities, including a characteristic lacy pattern of abnormally dark skin coloring (hyperpigmentation) that occurs mostly in the body's folds and creases. Most KRT5 gene mutations that cause Dowling-Degos disease lead to the production of a keratin 5 protein that is abnormally small and nonfunctional or prevent any protein from being produced from the gene. A shortage (deficiency) of functional keratin 5 impairs the formation of keratin intermediate filaments. As a result, the organization of the epidermis is altered, leading to the development of different types of skin abnormalities. Additionally, a deficiency of keratin 5 may disrupt the movement of pigment-carrying melanosomes into keratinocytes, where they are needed for the development of normal skin pigmentation. This disruption of melanosome transport is thought to cause the pigmentation abnormalities seen in individuals with Dowling-Degos disease. "
738,KRT6A ,keratin 6A,"The KRT6A gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin 6a or K6a. Keratins are a group of tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of certain cells, particularly cells that make up the skin, hair, nails, and similar tissues. Keratin 6a is produced in the nails, the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, and the oral mucosa that lines the inside of the mouth.Keratin 6a partners with a similar protein, keratin 16, to form molecules called keratin intermediate filaments. These filaments assemble into dense networks that provide strength and resilience to the skin, nails, and other tissues. Networks of keratin intermediate filaments protect these tissues from being damaged by friction and other everyday physical stresses. Keratin 6a is also among several keratins involved in wound healing.","Pachyonychia congenita About 40 mutations in the KRT6A gene have been identified in people with pachyonychia congenita, a rare condition that primarily affects the nails and skin. In most cases, this condition becomes apparent within the first few months of life. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in keratin 6a. A few mutations add or delete a small number of amino acids.The KRT6A gene mutations responsible for pachyonychia congenita change the structure of keratin 6a, preventing it from interacting effectively with keratin 16 and interfering with the assembly of the keratin intermediate filament network. Without this network, skin cells become fragile and are easily damaged, making the skin less resistant to friction and minor trauma. Even normal activities such as walking can cause skin cells to break down, resulting in the formation of severe, painful blisters and calluses. Additionally, fragile skin cells may abnormally produce more keratin in response to damage, which makes the skin problems worse. Defective keratin 6a also disrupts the growth and function of other tissues, such as the hair follicles and nails, which explains why the signs and symptoms of pachyonychia congenita can also affect these other parts of the body. "
739,KRT6B ,keratin 6B,"The KRT6B gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin 6b or K6b. Keratins are a group of tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of certain cells, particularly cells that make up the skin, hair, and nails. Keratin 6b is produced in the nails, the hair follicles, and the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It is also found in the skin's sebaceous glands, which produce an oily substance called sebum.Keratin 6b partners with a similar protein, keratin 17, to form molecules called keratin intermediate filaments. These filaments assemble into dense networks that provide strength and resilience to the skin, nails, and other tissues. Networks of keratin intermediate filaments protect these tissues from being damaged by friction and other everyday physical stresses. Keratin 6b is also among several keratins involved in wound healing.","Pachyonychia congenita At least four mutations in the KRT6B gene have been identified in people with pachyonychia congenita, a rare condition that primarily affects the nails and skin. In most cases, this condition becomes apparent within the first few months of life. These mutations either change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in keratin 6b or delete a small number of amino acids from the protein.The KRT6B gene mutations responsible for pachyonychia congenita change the structure of keratin 6b, preventing it from interacting effectively with keratin 17 and interfering with the assembly of the keratin intermediate filament network. Without this network, skin cells become fragile and are easily damaged, making the skin less resistant to friction and minor trauma. Even normal activities such as walking can cause skin cells to break down, resulting in the formation of painful blisters and calluses. In the sebaceous glands, abnormal keratin filaments lead to the development of sebum-filled cysts called steatocystomas. Defective keratin 6b also disrupts the growth and function of other tissues, such as the hair follicles and nails, which explains why the signs and symptoms of pachyonychia congenita can also affect these other parts of the body. "
740,KRT6C ,keratin 6C,"The KRT6C gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin 6c or K6c. Keratins are a group of tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of certain cells, particularly cells that make up the skin, hair, and nails. Keratin 6c is found in the skin, although it is unknown which other tissues may produce this protein.Keratin 6c is a component of molecules called keratin intermediate filaments. These filaments assemble into dense networks that provide strength and resilience to the skin, nails, and other tissues. Networks of keratin intermediate filaments protect these tissues from being damaged by friction and other everyday physical stresses.","Pachyonychia congenita At least four mutations in the KRT6C gene have been found to cause pachyonychia congenita, a rare condition that primarily affects the nails and skin. In most cases, this condition becomes apparent within the first few months of life.One of the mutations associated with pachyonychia congenita changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the keratin 6c protein. Specifically, this mutation replaces the amino acid glutamic acid with the amino acid lysine at protein position 472 (written as Glu472Lys or E472K). The other KRT6C gene mutations delete one or more amino acids from the keratin 6c protein.All of the known KRT6C gene mutations alter the structure of keratin 6c and interfere with the assembly of the keratin intermediate filament network. Without this network, skin cells become fragile and are easily damaged, making the skin less resistant to friction and minor trauma. Even normal activities such as walking can cause skin cells to break down, resulting in the formation of severe, painful blisters and calluses.

"
741,KRT10 ,keratin 10,"The KRT10 gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin 10. Keratins are a group of tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of cells called keratinocytes that make up the skin, hair, and nails. Keratin 10 is produced in keratinocytes in the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis).In the fluid-filled space inside these cells (the cytoplasm), the keratin 10 protein partners with a similar protein, keratin 1 (produced from the KRT1 gene), to form molecules called keratin intermediate filaments. These filaments assemble into strong networks that provide strength and resiliency to the skin and protect it from being damaged by friction and other everyday physical stresses.","Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis Dozens of mutations in the KRT10 gene have been found in people with epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. This condition is characterized by red, blistering skin at an early age and thick skin (hyperkeratosis) later in life. People with KRT10 gene mutations typically have NPS-type epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, which features thick skin on many parts of the body but not the palms of the hands or soles of the feet.Most KRT10 gene mutations associated with epidermolytic hyperkeratosis change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the keratin 10 protein.

These filaments assemble into strong networks that provide strength and resilience to the corneal epithelium.","Meesmann corneal dystrophy At least 20 mutations in the KRT12 gene have been found to cause Meesmann corneal dystrophy, an eye disease characterized by the formation of tiny cysts in the corneal epithelium.Almost all of the KRT12 gene mutations associated with Meesmann corneal dystrophy change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the keratin 12 protein. These changes occur in regions of the protein that are critical for the formation and stability of intermediate filaments. The altered keratin 12 protein interferes with the assembly of intermediate filaments, weakening the structural framework of the corneal epithelium. As a result, this outer layer of the cornea is abnormally fragile and develops the cysts that characterize Meesmann corneal dystrophy. The cysts likely contain clumps of abnormal keratin proteins and other cellular debris. When the cysts break open (rupture), they cause eye irritation, increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), and related symptoms. "
743,KRT13 ,keratin 13,"The KRT13 gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin 13. Keratins are a group of tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of epithelial cells, which are cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body. Keratin 13 is found in the moist lining (mucosae) of the mouth, nose, esophagus, genitals, and anus.Keratin 13 partners with a similar protein, keratin 4 (produced from the KRT4 gene), to form molecules known as intermediate filaments. These filaments assemble into strong networks that provide strength and resilience to the different mucosae. Networks of intermediate filaments protect the mucosae from being damaged by friction or other everyday physical stresses.","White sponge nevus At least five KRT13 gene mutations have been found to cause white sponge nevus, a condition that results in the formation of white patches of tissue called nevi (singular: nevus) that appear as thickened, velvety, sponge-like tissue.

Damage to intermediate filaments leads to inflammation and promotes the abnormal growth and division (proliferation) of epithelial cells, causing the mucosae to thicken and resulting in white sponge nevus. "
744,KRT14 ,keratin 14,"The KRT14 gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin 14. Keratins are a group of tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of certain cells, particularly cells that make up the skin, hair, and nails. Keratin 14 is specifically produced in cells called keratinocytes in the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis).Keratin 14 partners with a similar protein, keratin 5 (produced from the KRT5 gene), to form molecules called keratin intermediate filaments. These filaments assemble into strong networks that help attach keratinocytes together and anchor the epidermis to underlying layers of skin. The network of keratin intermediate filaments provides strength and resiliency to the skin and protects it from being damaged by friction and other everyday physical stresses.Researchers believe that keratin 14 may also play a role in the formation of sweat glands and the development of patterned ridges on the skin of the hands and feet. These ridges, called dermatoglyphs, are the basis for each person's unique fingerprints.","Epidermolysis bullosa simplex More than 60 mutations in the KRT14 gene have been identified in people with epidermolysis bullosa simplex, a condition that causes the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily. Most of these genetic changes alter single protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make keratin 14. The most severe form of epidermolysis bullosa simplex, the Dowling-Meara type, usually results from changes in regions of keratin 14 that are essential for the normal assembly of keratin intermediate filaments. Milder forms of the disorder, including the localized type (formerly called the Weber-Cockayne type) and a form known as the other generalized type (formerly called the Koebner type), are often caused by changes affecting less critical regions of the protein.KRT14 gene mutations change the structure and function of keratin 14, preventing it from working effectively with keratin 5 and interfering with the assembly of the keratin intermediate filament network. Mutations that cause severe forms of the disorder severely disrupt the assembly of keratin intermediate filaments, while mutations that result in milder forms impair keratin filament assembly to a lesser degree. A disruption in this network makes keratinocytes fragile and prone to rupture. Minor trauma to the skin, such as rubbing or scratching, can cause these cells to break down, resulting in the formation of painful, fluid-filled blisters. "
745,KRT16 ,keratin 16,"The KRT16 gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin 16 or K16. Keratins are a group of tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of certain cells, particularly cells that make up the skin, hair, and nails. Keratin 16 is produced in the nails, the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, and the oral mucosa that lines the inside of the mouth.Keratin 16 partners with a similar protein, keratin 6a, to form molecules called keratin intermediate filaments.

Keratin 16 is also among several keratins involved in wound healing.","Pachyonychia congenita At least 19 mutations in the KRT16 gene have been identified in people with pachyonychia congenita, a rare condition that primarily affects the nails and skin. In most cases, this condition becomes apparent within the first few months of life. Most of the KRT16 gene mutations associated with pachyonychia congenita change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in keratin 16. A few mutations delete a small number of amino acids from the protein.The KRT16 gene mutations responsible for pachyonychia congenita change the structure of keratin 16, preventing it from interacting effectively with keratin 6a and interfering with the assembly of the keratin intermediate filament network. Without this network, skin cells become fragile and are easily damaged, making the skin less resistant to friction and minor trauma. Even normal activities such as walking can cause skin cells to break down, resulting in the formation of severe, painful blisters and calluses. Additionally, fragile skin cells may abnormally produce more keratin in response to damage, which makes the skin problems worse. Defective keratin 16 also disrupts the growth and function of other tissues, such as the hair follicles and nails, which explains why the signs and symptoms of pachyonychia congenita can also affect these other parts of the body. "
746,KRT17 ,keratin 17,"The KRT17 gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin 17 or K17. Keratins are a group of tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of certain cells, particularly cells that make up the skin, hair, nails, and similar tissues. Keratin 17 is produced in the nails, the hair follicles, and the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It is also found in the skin's sebaceous glands, which produce an oily substance called sebum that normally lubricates the skin and hair.Keratin 17 partners with a similar protein, keratin 6b, to form molecules called keratin intermediate filaments. These filaments assemble into dense networks that provide strength and resilience to the skin, nails, and other tissues. Networks of keratin intermediate filaments protect these tissues from being damaged by friction and other everyday physical stresses. Keratin 17 is also among several keratins involved in wound healing.","Pachyonychia congenita More than 20 mutations in the KRT17 gene have been identified in people with pachyonychia congenita, a rare condition that primarily affects the nails and skin. In most cases, this condition becomes apparent within the first few months of life. Most of the KRT17 gene mutations associated with pachyonychia congenita change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in keratin 17.The KRT17 gene mutations responsible for pachyonychia congenita change the structure of keratin 17, preventing it from interacting effectively with keratin 6b and interfering with the assembly of the keratin intermediate filament network.

Even normal activities such as walking can cause skin cells to break down, resulting in the formation of painful blisters and calluses. In the sebaceous glands, abnormal keratin filaments lead to the development of sebum-filled cysts called steatocystomas. Defective keratin 17 also disrupts the growth and function of other tissues, such as the hair follicles and nails, which explains why the signs and symptoms of pachyonychia congenita can also affect these other parts of the body. "
747,KRT81 ,keratin 81,"The KRT81 gene provides instructions for making the type II hair keratin K81 protein (K81). This protein belongs to a group of proteins known as keratins, which are tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of cells that make up the hair, skin, and nails. Each keratin protein partners with another keratin protein to form molecules called intermediate filaments. These filaments assemble into strong networks that provide strength and resiliency to the tissues and protect them from being damaged by everyday physical stresses. The K81 protein is found in cells that make up the inner compartment of the hair shaft known as the cortex, and this protein helps give hair its strength and elasticity.","Monilethrix At least two mutations in the KRT81 gene have been identified in people with monilethrix, a hair condition characterized by strands of hair with a beaded appearance and short, brittle hair that breaks easily. Mutations associated with this condition change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the K81 protein. The amino acid changes usually occur in a region of the K81 protein thought to be important in intermediate filament formation. In people with monilethrix, the cortex of the affected hair shaft appears abnormal. However, it is unclear how mutations in the KRT81 gene are related to the abnormality in the cortex or the beaded appearance of the hair. "
748,KRT83 ,keratin 83,"The KRT83 gene provides instructions for making the type II hair keratin K83 protein (K83). This protein belongs to a group of proteins known as keratins, which are tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of cells that make up the hair, skin, and nails. Each keratin protein partners with another keratin protein to form molecules called intermediate filaments.

The K83 protein is found in cells that make up the inner compartment of the hair shaft known as the cortex, and this protein helps give hair its strength and elasticity.","Monilethrix Mutations in the KRT83 gene can cause monilethrix, a hair condition characterized by strands of hair with a beaded appearance and short, brittle hair that breaks easily. Mutations associated with this condition change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the K83 protein. The amino acid changes usually occur in a region of the K83 protein thought to be important in intermediate filament formation. In people with monilethrix, the cortex of the affected hair shaft appears abnormal. However, it is unclear how mutations in the KRT83 gene are related to the abnormality in the cortex or the beaded appearance of the hair. "
749,KRT86 ,keratin 86,"The KRT86 gene provides instructions for making the type II hair keratin K86 protein (K86). This protein belongs to a group of proteins known as keratins, which are tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of cells that make up the hair, skin, and nails. Each keratin protein partners with another keratin protein to form molecules called intermediate filaments. These filaments assemble into strong networks that provide strength and resiliency to the tissues and protect them from being damaged by everyday physical stresses. The K86 protein is found in cells that make up the inner compartment of the hair shaft known as the cortex, and this protein helps give hair its strength and elasticity.","Monilethrix Several mutations in the KRT86 gene can cause monilethrix, a hair condition characterized by strands of hair with a beaded appearance and short, brittle hair that breaks easily. Mutations associated with this condition change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the K86 protein. The amino acid changes usually occur in a region of the K86 protein thought to be important in intermediate filament formation. In people with monilethrix, the cortex of the affected hair shaft appears abnormal. However, it is unclear how mutations in the KRT86 gene are related to the abnormality in the cortex or the beaded appearance of the hair. "
750,L1CAM ,L1 cell adhesion molecule,"The L1CAM gene provides instructions for producing the L1 cell adhesion molecule protein (shortened to L1 protein), which is found on the surface of nerve cells (neurons) throughout the nervous system. The L1 protein spans the cell membrane, with one end of the protein inside the cell and the other end projecting from the outer surface of the cell. This positioning allows the L1 protein to attach (bind) to other proteins, including other L1 proteins, on neighboring neurons to help these cells stick to one another (cell-cell adhesion).The L1 protein plays a role in the movement (migration) and organization of neurons and the outgrowth of axons, which are specialized extensions of neurons that transmit nerve impulses. The protein also plays a role in the formation of the protective sheath (myelin) that surrounds certain neurons and the formation of junctions between nerve cells (synapses), where cell-to-cell communication occurs. These neuronal functions contribute to brain development, thinking ability, memory, and movement.","L1 syndrome More than 350 mutations in the L1CAM gene have been found to cause L1 syndrome. L1 syndrome describes a group of conditions that vary in severity, primarily affect the nervous system, and occur almost exclusively in males. People with L1 syndrome often have brain abnormalities, intellectual disability, and movement problems. The L1CAM gene mutations that cause this condition lead to an L1 protein that cannot facilitate cell-cell adhesion or participate in various neuronal functions. Disruption of these functions likely impedes the growth and development of the brain, leading to the signs and symptoms of L1 syndrome.Some L1CAM gene mutations result in the production of a protein that is abnormally short and nonfunctional or result in a complete absence of protein. These mutations typically lead to severe cases of L1 syndrome. Other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the L1 protein, impairing the protein's ability to interact with other proteins at the cell surface or preventing the protein from reaching the cell surface where it is needed. These mutations typically lead to the milder forms of L1 syndrome. While a gene mutation's effect on the L1 protein can sometimes provide a clue to the severity of the condition, individuals with the same or similar mutations often have very different signs and symptoms. "
751,L2HGDH ,L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase,"The L2HGDH gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase. This enzyme is found in mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers within cells. Within mitochondria, the enzyme participates in reactions that produce energy for cell activities. Specifically, L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase converts a compound called L-2-hydroxyglutarate to another compound called 2-ketoglutarate. A series of additional enzymes further process 2-ketoglutarate to produce energy.","2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria Researchers have identified more than 70 mutations in the L2HGDH gene that cause a type of 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria known as L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (L-2-HGA). This condition has a variety of signs and symptoms that result from progressive damage to the brain beginning early in life.Some L2HGDH gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase enzyme, which likely impairs its function. Other mutations insert or delete genetic material in the gene or lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the enzyme. With a shortage of functional enzyme, L-2-hydroxyglutarate is not broken down but instead builds up in cells. At high levels, this compound can damage cells and lead to cell death. Brain cells appear to be the most vulnerable to the toxic effects of this compound, which may explain why the signs and symptoms of L-2-HGA primarily involve the brain. "
752,LAMA2 ,laminin subunit alpha 2,"The LAMA2 gene provides instructions for making a part (subunit) of certain members of a protein family called laminins. Laminin proteins are made of three different subunits called alpha, beta, and gamma. There are several forms of each subunit, and each form is produced from instructions carried by a different gene. The LAMA2 gene provides instructions for the alpha-2 subunit. This subunit, together with the beta-1 and gamma-1 subunits, forms the laminin 2 protein, also known as merosin or laminin-211. The alpha-2 subunit, along with the beta-2 and gamma-1 subunits, also forms another laminin called laminin 4, sometimes known as laminin-221.Laminins are found in an intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells (the extracellular matrix). There, the laminins help regulate cell growth, cell movement (motility), and the attachment of cells to one another (adhesion). They are also involved in the formation and organization of basement membranes, which are thin, sheet-like structures within the extracellular matrix that separate and support cells in many tissues. Laminin 2 and laminin 4 play a particularly important role in the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). The laminins attach (bind) to other proteins in the extracellular matrix and in the membrane of muscle cells, which helps maintain the stability of muscle fibers.","LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy More than 100 LAMA2 gene mutations have been identified in individuals with LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy, a disorder that causes weakness and wasting (atrophy) of skeletal muscles. This condition generally appears in one of two ways: as a severe, early-onset type or a milder, late-onset form. Most LAMA2 gene mutations that cause early-onset LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy result in the absence of functional laminin alpha-2 subunit. Mutations that cause late-onset LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy usually result in a reduction (deficiency) of functional laminin alpha-2 subunit. Deficiency or absence of the laminin alpha-2 subunit results in a corresponding lack of laminin 2 and laminin 4, reducing the strength and stability of muscle tissue and leading to the signs and symptoms of LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy. "
753,LAMA3 ,laminin subunit alpha 3,"The LAMA3 gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of a protein called laminin 332 (formerly known as laminin 5). This protein is made up of three subunits, called alpha, beta, and gamma. The LAMA3 gene carries instructions for the alpha subunit; the beta and gamma subunits are produced from other genes. Three versions of the alpha subunit, called alpha-3a, alpha-3b1, and alpha-3b2, are produced from the LAMA3 gene.Laminins are a group of proteins that regulate cell growth, cell movement (motility), and the attachment of cells to one another (adhesion). They are also involved in the formation and organization of basement membranes, which are thin, sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues. Laminin 332 has a particularly important role in the basement membrane that underlies the top layer of skin (the epidermis). This membrane gives strength and resiliency to the skin and creates an additional barrier between the body and its surrounding environment. Laminin 332 is a major component of fibers called anchoring filaments, which connect the two layers of the basement membrane and help hold the skin together.Studies suggest that laminin 332 also has several other functions. This protein appears to be important in the formation of early wound-healing tissues. Additionally, researchers have proposed roles for laminin 332 in the clear outer covering of the eye (the cornea) and in the development of tooth enamel.The alpha subunit produced from the LAMA3 gene is also part of two other laminin proteins, laminin 311 and laminin 321. These laminins also appear to provide strength to the skin, although they do not play as big a role as laminin 332. In addition, laminin 311 is involved in cell signaling in the lungs and other tissues.","Junctional epidermolysis bullosa At least 50 mutations in the LAMA3 gene have been identified in people with junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB). The more serious form of the disease, known as JEB generalized severe, usually results from mutations that prevent the production of functional laminin 332. Most of these mutations lead to a premature stop signal in the instructions for making all three versions of the alpha subunit, which disrupts the assembly of laminin 332. Without functional laminin 332, the epidermis is only weakly connected to the underlying layers of skin. Friction or other minor trauma (such as rubbing or scratching) can cause the skin layers to separate, leading to the formation of blisters. Infants with JEB generalized severe develop widespread blistering that causes life-threatening complications.Other LAMA3 gene mutations cause the milder form of junctional epidermolysis bullosa, JEB generalized intermediate. Some of these mutations alter single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the alpha subunit of laminin 332. Others add or remove a small number of amino acids in the alpha subunit or change the way the gene's instructions are used to make the subunit. The genetic changes responsible for milder cases of junctional epidermolysis bullosa usually lead to the production of a laminin 332 protein that retains some of its function. Affected individuals experience blistering, but it may be limited to the hands, feet, knees, and elbows. "
754,LAMB3 ,laminin subunit beta 3,"The LAMB3 gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of a protein called laminin 332 (formerly known as laminin 5). This protein is made up of three subunits, called alpha, beta, and gamma. The LAMB3 gene carries instructions for the beta subunit; the alpha and gamma subunits are produced from other genes.Laminins are a group of proteins that regulate cell growth, cell movement (motility), and the attachment of cells to one another (adhesion).

The genetic changes responsible for JEB generalized intermediate usually lead to the production of a laminin 332 protein that retains some of its function. Affected individuals experience blistering, but it may be limited to the hands, feet, knees, and elbows and often improves after the newborn period. "
755,LAMC2 ,laminin subunit gamma 2,"The LAMC2 gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of a protein called laminin 332 (formerly known as laminin 5). This protein is made up of three subunits, called alpha, beta, and gamma. The LAMC2 gene carries instructions for the gamma subunit; the alpha and beta subunits are produced from other genes.Laminins are a group of proteins that regulate cell growth, cell movement (motility), and the attachment of cells to one another (adhesion).

The more serious form of the disease, known as JEB generalized severe, usually results from mutations that prevent the production of functional laminin 332. Most of these mutations lead to a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the gamma subunit of laminin 332, which prevents the assembly of this protein.

Affected individuals experience blistering, but it may be limited to the hands, feet, knees, and elbows and often improves after the newborn period. "
756,LAMP2 ,lysosomal associated membrane protein 2,"The LAMP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called lysosomal associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP-2), which, as its name suggests, is found in the membrane of cellular structures called lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments in the cell that digest and recycle materials. The role the LAMP-2 protein plays in the lysosome is unclear. Some researchers think the LAMP-2 protein may help transport cellular materials or digestive enzymes into the lysosome. The transport of cellular materials into lysosomes requires the formation of cellular structures called autophagic vacuoles (or autophagosomes). Cellular material that will be degraded in a lysosome is first enclosed in an autophagic vacuole inside the cell. The autophagic vacuole attaches (fuses) to a lysosome to transfer the cellular material into the lysosome where it can be broken down. The LAMP-2 protein may be involved in the fusion between autophagic vacuoles and lysosomes.Slightly different versions (isoforms) of the LAMP-2 protein are produced: LAMP-2A, LAMP-2B, and LAMP-2C. These isoforms are found in different tissues throughout the body. LAMP-2B is the main isoform found in the heart and the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles).","Danon disease There are many mutations in the LAMP2 gene that can cause Danon disease. Danon disease is a condition characterized by weakening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy), weakening of skeletal muscles (myopathy), and intellectual disability. This condition affects men more severely than women.The LAMP2 gene mutations that cause Danon disease lead to the production of very little or no LAMP-2 protein. Most mutations affect all three isoforms of the LAMP-2 protein. However, a mutation that affects only the LAMP-2B isoform also causes Danon disease, suggesting that the condition is caused by defects in the LAMP-2B protein.Some studies have shown that in cells without the LAMP-2 protein, fusion between autophagic vacuoles and lysosomes occurs more slowly, which may lead to the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles. People with Danon disease have an abnormally large number of autophagic vacuoles in their heart and skeletal muscle cells. It is possible that this accumulation leads to breakdown of the muscle cells, causing the muscle weakness seen in Danon disease.Some people with LAMP2 gene mutations develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without the other characteristic features of Danon disease. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a thickening of the heart muscle that may make it harder for the heart to pump blood. In people with LAMP2 gene mutations, the lower left chamber of the heart, called the left ventricle, is usually the affected region. People with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy caused by LAMP2 mutations often have a particular abnormality of the electrical signals that control the heartbeat called cardiac preexcitation. It is unclear whether this is a separate condition or a milder form of Danon disease. Furthermore, it is unknown why some people with LAMP2 mutations develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy but not the other features of Danon disease. "
757,LARGE1 ,LARGE xylosyl- and glucuronyltransferase 1,"The protein produced from the LARGE1 gene is found in a specialized structure within cells called the Golgi apparatus, where newly produced proteins are modified. The LARGE1 protein is involved in a process called glycosylation. Through this chemical process, sugar molecules are added to certain proteins. In particular, the LARGE1 protein adds chains of sugar molecules composed of xylose and glucuronic acid to a protein called alpha (α)-dystroglycan. Glycosylation is critical for the normal function of α-dystroglycan.The α-dystroglycan protein helps anchor the structural framework inside each cell (cytoskeleton) to the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell (extracellular matrix). In skeletal muscles, glycosylated α-dystroglycan helps stabilize and protect muscle fibers. In the brain, it helps direct the movement (migration) of nerve cells (neurons) during early development.","Walker-Warburg syndrome At least seven mutations in the LARGE1 gene have been found to cause Walker-Warburg syndrome. This condition is the most severe form of a group of disorders known as congenital muscular dystrophies. Walker-Warburg syndrome causes skeletal muscle weakness and abnormalities of the brain and eyes. Because of the severity of the problems caused by this condition, affected individuals usually do not survive past early childhood.LARGE1 gene mutations involved in Walker-Warburg syndrome prevent the normal glycosylation of α-dystroglycan. As a result, α-dystroglycan can no longer effectively anchor cells to the proteins and other molecules that surround them. Without functional α-dystroglycan to stabilize the muscle fibers, they become damaged as they repeatedly contract and relax with use. The damaged fibers weaken and die over time, which affects the development, structure, and function of skeletal muscles in people with Walker-Warburg syndrome.Defective α-dystroglycan also affects the migration of neurons during the early development of the brain. Instead of stopping when they reach their intended destinations, some neurons migrate past the surface of the brain into the fluid-filled space that surrounds it. Researchers believe that this problem with neuronal migration causes a brain abnormality called cobblestone lissencephaly, in which the surface of the brain lacks the normal folds and grooves and instead appears bumpy and irregular. Less is known about the effects of LARGE1 gene mutations on other parts of the body. "
758,LARS2 ,"leucyl-tRNA synthetase 2, mitochondrial","The LARS2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase. This enzyme is important in the production (synthesis) of proteins in cellular structures called mitochondria, the energy-producing centers in cells. While most protein synthesis occurs in the fluid surrounding the nucleus (cytoplasm), some proteins are synthesized in the mitochondria.During protein synthesis, in either the mitochondria or the cytoplasm, a type of RNA called transfer RNA (tRNA) helps assemble protein building blocks (amino acids) into a chain that forms the protein. Each tRNA carries a specific amino acid to the growing chain. Enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, including mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase, attach a particular amino acid to a specific tRNA. Mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase attaches the amino acid leucine to the correct tRNA, which helps ensure that leucine is added at the proper place in the mitochondrial protein.","Perrault syndrome At least three mutations in the LARS2 gene have been found in individuals with Perrault syndrome, a condition characterized by hearing loss in affected males and females and abnormalities of the ovaries in affected females. The LARS2 gene mutations involved in Perrault syndrome reduce or eliminate the activity of mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase. A shortage of functional mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase prevents the normal assembly of new proteins within mitochondria. Researchers speculate that impaired protein assembly disrupts mitochondrial energy production. However, it is unclear exactly how LARS2 gene mutations lead to hearing problems and ovarian abnormalities in affected individuals. "
759,LBR ,lamin B receptor,"The LBR gene provides instructions for making a protein called the lamin B receptor. Different regions (domains) of this protein give it two distinct functions.One region of the protein, called the sterol reductase domain, gives the protein sterol reductase function (specifically Δ14-sterol reductase function). This function of the lamin B receptor plays an important role in the production (synthesis) of cholesterol. Cholesterol is a lipid (fat) that is obtained from foods that come from animals: eggs, meat, fish, and dairy products. The body also makes (synthesizes) its own cholesterol. During cholesterol synthesis, the sterol reductase function of the lamin B receptor allows the protein to perform one of several chemical reactions that convert a molecule called lanosterol to cholesterol.The body needs cholesterol to develop and function normally. Before birth, cholesterol interacts with signaling proteins that control early development of the brain, limbs, genitals, and other structures. It is also an important component of cell membranes and myelin, the fatty covering that insulates nerve cells. Additionally, cholesterol is used to make certain hormones and is important for the production of acids used in digestion (bile acids).Another region of the lamin B receptor, called the DNA-binding domain, attaches (binds) to chromatin, the complex of DNA and proteins that packages DNA into chromosomes. The lamin B receptor can be found in the membrane that surrounds the nucleus (the nuclear envelope). The protein's interaction with chromatin attaches it to the nuclear envelope and helps maintain the chromatin's structure. Proper interaction of chromatin with the nuclear envelope may play a role in several important cellular functions such as making new copies of DNA (replication), controlling the activity of genes, and regulating programmed cell death (apoptosis). The DNA-binding domain of the protein also plays a role in the formation of the nucleus within cells.","Greenberg dysplasia Several mutations in the LBR gene have been found to cause Greenberg dysplasia. This severe condition is characterized by abnormal bone formation and is fatal before birth. Research suggests that this condition is caused by the loss of the sterol reductase function of the lamin B receptor. Some LBR gene mutations that cause Greenberg dysplasia change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the sterol reductase domain of the lamin B receptor, which leads to the loss of sterol reductase activity. Other mutations lead to an abnormally short protein that is likely nonfunctional.Loss of the sterol reductase function of the lamin B receptor disrupts the normal synthesis of cholesterol within cells. Absence of this function may also allow potentially toxic byproducts of cholesterol synthesis to build up in the body's tissues. Researchers suspect that low cholesterol levels or an accumulation of other substances disrupts the growth and development of many parts of the body. It is not known, however, how a disturbance of cholesterol synthesis leads to the specific features of Greenberg dysplasia. "
760,LCAT ,lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase,"The LCAT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). This enzyme plays a role in removing cholesterol from the blood and tissues. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is produced in the body and obtained from foods that come from animals (particularly egg yolks, meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products). The body needs this substance to build cell membranes, make certain hormones, and produce compounds that aid in fat digestion. Too much cholesterol, however, increases a person's risk of developing heart disease, and can also lead to buildup of cholesterol in other tissues.The LCAT enzyme helps transport cholesterol out of the blood and tissues by a process called cholesterol esterification. This process results in a form of cholesterol that is more efficiently carried by molecules called lipoproteins, which transport the cholesterol to the liver. Once in the liver, the cholesterol is redistributed to other tissues or removed from the body. The enzyme has two major functions, called alpha- and beta-LCAT activity. Alpha-LCAT activity helps attach cholesterol to a lipoprotein called high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Beta-LCAT activity helps attach cholesterol to other lipoproteins called very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL).","Complete LCAT deficiency More than 70 mutations in the LCAT gene have been identified in people with complete LCAT deficiency, a disorder that primarily causes corneal clouding and kidney problems. Individuals with complete LCAT deficiency have mutations in both copies of the LCAT gene in each cell. Most of these mutations change single amino acids in the LCAT enzyme sequence. Others add or delete small amounts of genetic material in the LCAT gene. The mutations either prevent the production of LCAT or impair both alpha-LCAT and beta-LCAT activity, reducing the enzyme's ability to attach cholesterol to lipoproteins. Impairment of this mechanism for reducing cholesterol in the body leads to cholesterol deposits in the corneas, kidneys, and other tissues and organs. These deposits cause the signs and symptoms of complete LCAT deficiency. "
761,LCT ,lactase,"The LCT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called lactase. This enzyme helps to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products.Lactase is produced by cells that line the walls of the small intestine. These cells, called intestinal epithelial cells, have finger-like projections called microvilli that absorb nutrients from food as it passes through the intestine so they can be absorbed into the bloodstream. Based on their appearance, groups of these microvilli are known collectively as the brush border. Lactase functions at the brush border to break down lactose into smaller sugars called glucose and galactose for absorption.","Lactose intolerance At least nine LCT gene mutations cause congenital lactase deficiency, also called congenital alactasia. In this disorder, infants are unable to break down lactose (lactose intolerance) in breast milk or formula. The LCT gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the lactase enzyme or result in an enzyme that is abnormally short. The mutations are believed to interfere with the function of the lactase enzyme, leading to undigested lactose in the small intestine and causing severe diarrhea.Lactose intolerance in adulthood is caused by gradually decreasing activity (expression) of the LCT gene after infancy, which occurs in most humans. "
762,LDB3 ,LIM domain binding 3,"The LDB3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called LIM domain binding 3 (LDB3). The LDB3 protein is found in heart (cardiac) muscle and muscles used for movement (skeletal muscle). Within muscle fibers, LDB3 proteins are found in structures called sarcomeres, which are necessary for muscles to tense (contract). This protein attaches (binds) to other proteins and is involved in maintaining the stability of rod-like structures within sarcomeres called Z-discs. Z-discs link neighboring sarcomeres together to form myofibrils, the basic unit of muscle fibers. The linking of sarcomeres and formation of myofibrils provide strength for muscle fibers during repeated cycles of muscle contraction and relaxation.Several different versions (isoforms) of the LDB3 protein are produced from the LDB3 gene.","Myofibrillar myopathy At least three mutations in the LDB3 gene have been found to cause myofibrillar myopathy. These mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the LDB3 protein. Mutated LDB3 proteins cluster together with other muscle proteins in the sarcomere to form clumps (aggregates). The aggregates prevent these proteins from functioning normally. A dysfunctional desmin protein cannot properly interact with Z-discs, leading to abnormalities of sarcomere structure and problems with the formation of myofibrils. LDB3 gene mutations that cause myofibrillar myopathy impair the function of muscle fibers, causing weakness and the other features of this condition. "
763,LDHA ,lactate dehydrogenase A,"The LDHA gene provides instructions for making a protein called lactate dehydrogenase-A, which is one piece (subunit) of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme. There are five different forms of this enzyme, each made up of four protein subunits. Various combinations of lactate dehydrogenase-A subunits and lactate dehydrogenase-B subunits (which are produced from a different gene) make up the different forms of the enzyme. The lactate dehydrogenase enzyme is found throughout the body and is important for performing a chemical reaction that provides energy for the body.The version of lactate dehydrogenase made of four lactate dehydrogenase-A subunits is found primarily in skeletal muscles, which are muscles used for movement. Skeletal muscles need large amounts of energy during high-intensity physical activity when the body's oxygen intake is not sufficient for the amount of energy required (anaerobic exercise). To create additional energy, glucose stored in the body as glycogen gets broken down. During the final stage of glycogen breakdown, the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme converts the molecule pyruvate into a similar molecule called lactate, which can be used by the body for energy.","Lactate dehydrogenase deficiency At least eight mutations in the LDHA gene have been found to cause lactate dehydrogenase deficiency, specifically lactate dehydrogenase-A deficiency. This condition is characterized by extreme tiredness and the breakdown of muscle tissue following high-intensity exercise or other strenuous activity. LDHA gene mutations result in the production of an abnormal lactate dehydrogenase-A subunit that cannot attach (bind) to other subunits to form lactate dehydrogenase enzyme. A lack of functional subunit reduces the amount of enzyme that is formed, mostly affecting skeletal muscles. As a result, glycogen is not broken down efficiently, leading to decreased energy in muscle cells. When muscle cells do not get sufficient energy during strenuous physical activity, the muscles become weak and muscle tissue can break down, as experienced by people with lactate dehydrogenase-A deficiency. "
764,LDHB ,lactate dehydrogenase B,"The LDHB gene provides instructions for making a protein called lactate dehydrogenase-B, which is one piece (subunit) of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme. There are five different forms of this enzyme, each made up of four protein subunits. Various combinations of lactate dehydrogenase-B subunits and lactate dehydrogenase-A subunits (which are produced from a different gene) make up the different forms of the enzyme. The lactate dehydrogenase enzyme, which is found throughout the body, is important for creating energy for cells. The simple sugar glucose is the energy source for most cells. In the final step of glucose breakdown, most forms of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme convert the molecule pyruvate into a similar molecule called lactate, which can be used by the body for energy. Other forms of this enzyme can convert lactate back to pyruvate, which can participate in other chemical reactions to create energy.The version of lactate dehydrogenase made of four lactate dehydrogenase-B subunits is found primarily in heart (cardiac) muscle. This version of the enzyme converts lactate to pyruvate.","Lactate dehydrogenase deficiency More than 15 mutations in the LDHB gene have been found to cause lactate dehydrogenase deficiency, specifically lactate dehydrogenase-B deficiency. This condition is associated with a decrease in functional lactate dehydrogenase enzyme, but it does not appear to cause any physical signs or symptoms. Most LDHB gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the lactate dehydrogenase-B subunit. LDHB gene mutations lead to the production of an abnormal lactate dehydrogenase-B subunit that cannot form the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme. Even though lactate dehydrogenase activity is decreased in cardiac muscle cells of people with lactate dehydrogenase-B deficiency, they do not appear to have any signs or symptoms related to their condition. It is unclear why this type of enzyme deficiency does not cause any health problems. "
765,LDLR ,low density lipoprotein receptor,"The LDLR gene provides instructions for making a protein called the low-density lipoprotein receptor. This receptor binds to particles called low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), which are the primary carriers of cholesterol in the blood. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is produced in the body and obtained from foods that come from animals.Low-density lipoprotein receptors sit on the outer surface of many types of cells, where they pick up LDLs circulating in the bloodstream and transport them into the cell. Once inside the cell, the LDL is broken down to release cholesterol. The cholesterol is then used by the cell, stored, or removed from the body. After low-density lipoprotein receptors drop off their cargo, they are recycled back to the cell surface to pick up more LDLs.Low-density lipoprotein receptors play a critical role in regulating the amount of cholesterol in the blood. They are particularly abundant in the liver, which is the organ responsible for removing most excess cholesterol from the body. The number of low-density lipoprotein receptors on the surface of liver cells determines how quickly cholesterol is removed from the bloodstream.","Familial hypercholesterolemia Mutations in the LDLR gene cause a form of high cholesterol called familial hypercholesterolemia. More than 2,000 mutations have been identified in this gene. Some of these genetic changes reduce the number of low-density lipoprotein receptors produced within cells. Other mutations disrupt the receptor's ability to remove LDLs from the blood. As a result, people with mutations in the LDLR gene have very high blood cholesterol levels. As the excess cholesterol circulates through the bloodstream, it is deposited abnormally in tissues such as the skin, tendons, and arteries that supply blood to the heart (coronary arteries). A buildup of cholesterol in the walls of coronary arteries greatly increases a person's risk of having a heart attack.Most people with familial hypercholesterolemia inherit one altered copy of the LDLR gene from an affected parent and one normal copy of the gene from the other parent. These cases are associated with an increased risk of early heart disease, typically beginning in a person's forties or fifties. Rarely, a person with familial hypercholesterolemia is born with two mutated copies of the LDLR gene. This situation occurs when the person has two affected parents, each of whom passes on one altered copy of the gene. The presence of two LDLR gene mutations results in a more severe form of hypercholesterolemia that usually appears in childhood. "
766,LDLRAP1 ,low density lipoprotein receptor adaptor protein 1,"The LDLRAP1 gene (also known as ARH) provides instructions for making a protein that helps remove cholesterol from the bloodstream. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is produced in the body and obtained from foods that come from animals. The function of the LDLRAP1 protein is particularly important in the liver, which is the organ responsible for clearing most excess cholesterol from the body.The LDLRAP1 protein interacts with a protein called a low-density lipoprotein receptor. This type of receptor attaches (binds) to particles called low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), which are the primary carriers of cholesterol in the blood. The receptors sit on the outer surface of cells, where they pick up LDLs circulating in the bloodstream. The LDLRAP1 protein appears to play a critical role in moving these receptors, together with their attached LDLs, from the cell surface to the interior of the cell. Once inside the cell, LDLs are broken down to release cholesterol. The cholesterol is then used by the cell, stored, or removed from the body.","Familial hypercholesterolemia More than 20 mutations in the LDLRAP1 gene have been shown to cause a form of familial hypercholesterolemia called autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia. These mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the LDLRAP1 protein or prevent cells from making any of this protein. Without the LDLRAP1 protein, low-density lipoprotein receptors are unable to remove LDLs from the bloodstream effectively. Although the receptors can still bind normally to LDLs, these molecules are not properly transported into cells (particularly liver cells). As a result, many extra LDLs remain in the blood.Because LDLs are major carriers of cholesterol in the blood, people with mutations in the LDLRAP1 gene have very high blood levels of cholesterol. As the excess cholesterol circulates through the bloodstream, it is deposited abnormally in tissues such as the skin, tendons, and arteries that supply blood to the heart (coronary arteries). A buildup of cholesterol in the walls of coronary arteries greatly increases a person's risk of having a heart attack. "
767,LEMD3 ,LEM domain containing 3,"The LEMD3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is located in a cell structure called the nuclear envelope. The nuclear envelope surrounds the nucleus, acting as a barrier between the nucleus and the rest of the cell.The LEMD3 protein helps control two chemical signaling pathways called the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) pathway and the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) pathway. The TGF-β and BMP pathways regulate various cellular processes, including cell growth and division (proliferation), the process by which cells mature to carry out special functions (differentiation), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). These pathways are also involved in the growth of new bone.Signaling through the BMP and TGF-β pathways turns on (activates) proteins called Smads, which attach (bind) to specific areas of DNA to activate certain genes. The LEMD3 protein interacts with Smads to reduce signaling through these pathways. In this way, the LEMD3 protein helps keep signaling at normal levels within the cell.","Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome At least 23 mutations in the LEMD3 gene have been found to cause Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome, a rare connective tissue disorder. (Connective tissues provide support, strength, and flexibility to organs and tissues throughout the body.) The condition is characterized by skin growths called connective tissue nevi and bone abnormalities, most commonly osteopoikilosis. Osteopoikilosis refers to small, round areas of increased bone density that can be seen on x-rays. Rarely, people with Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome have another bone abnormality called melorheostosis, which is characterized by excess bone growth on the surface of existing bones in a pattern resembling dripping candle wax.Each of the known LEMD3 gene mutations prevents the production of functional LEMD3 protein from one copy of the gene in each cell, which reduces the total amount of LEMD3 protein by about half. A shortage of this protein increases signaling through the BMP and TGF-β pathways. Studies suggest that the enhanced signaling increases the formation of bone tissue, resulting in areas of overly dense bone or excess bone growth. It is unclear how the increased signaling is related to the development of connective tissue nevi in people with Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome. "
768,LEP ,leptin,"The LEP gene provides instructions for making a hormone called leptin, which is involved in the regulation of body weight. Normally, the body's fat cells release leptin in proportion to their size. As fat accumulates in cells, more leptin is produced. This rise in leptin indicates that fat stores are increasing.Leptin attaches (binds) to and activates a protein called the leptin receptor, fitting into the receptor like a key into a lock. The leptin receptor protein is found on the surface of cells in many organs and tissues of the body including a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus controls hunger and thirst as well as other functions such as sleep, moods, and body temperature. It also regulates the release of many hormones that have functions throughout the body. In the hypothalamus, the binding of leptin to its receptor triggers a series of chemical signals that affect hunger and help produce a feeling of fullness (satiety).","Congenital leptin deficiency At least seven LEP gene mutations that cause congenital leptin deficiency have been identified. This disorder is associated with excessive hunger, massive weight gain, and reduced production of hormones that direct sexual development (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism). The LEP gene mutations that cause congenital leptin deficiency lead to an absence of leptin. As a result, the signaling that triggers feelings of satiety does not occur, leading to the excessive hunger and weight gain associated with this disorder. Because hypogonadotropic hypogonadism occurs in congenital leptin deficiency, researchers suggest that leptin signaling is also involved in regulating the hormones that control sexual development. However, the specifics of this involvement and how it may be altered in congenital leptin deficiency are unknown. "
769,LEPR ,leptin receptor,"The LEPR gene provides instructions for making a protein called the leptin receptor, which is involved in the regulation of body weight. The leptin receptor protein is found on the surface of cells in many organs and tissues of the body, including a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus controls hunger and thirst as well as other functions such as sleep, moods, and body temperature. It also regulates the release of many hormones that have functions throughout the body.The leptin receptor is turned on (activated) by a hormone called leptin that attaches (binds) to the receptor, fitting into it like a key into a lock. Normally, the body's fat cells release leptin in proportion to their size. As fat cells become larger, they produce more leptin. This rise in leptin indicates that fat stores are increasing. In the hypothalamus, the binding of leptin to its receptor triggers a series of chemical signals that affect hunger and help produce a feeling of fullness (satiety).","Leptin receptor deficiency At least 18 LEPR gene mutations that cause leptin receptor deficiency have been identified; this disorder is associated with excessive hunger, massive weight gain, and reduced production of hormones that direct sexual development (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism). Some of the mutations result in less receptor protein getting to the cell surface where leptin binding takes place. The receptors that get to the cell surface may bind to leptin, but their signaling function is impaired. The resulting shortage of leptin signaling disrupts normal feelings of hunger and satiety, leading to extreme weight gain.Because hypogonadotropic hypogonadism occurs in leptin receptor deficiency, researchers suggest that leptin receptor signaling is also involved in regulating the body's response to hormones that control sexual development, and that this response is affected by LEPR gene mutations. However, the mechanism of this effect is unknown. "
770,LETM1 ,leucine zipper and EF-hand containing transmembrane protein 1,"The LETM1 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not well understood. This protein is active in mitochondria, which are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. The LETM1 protein may be involved in the transport of charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) across membranes within mitochondria. Researchers suspect that the protein also plays a role in determining the shape and volume of mitochondria.","Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome The LETM1 gene is located in a region of chromosome 4 that is deleted in people with the typical features of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. As a result of this deletion, affected individuals are missing one copy of the LETM1 gene in each cell. Studies suggest that a loss of this gene alters the structure of mitochondria; however, it is unclear how this abnormality is related to the signs and symptoms of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. Specifically, a loss of the LETM1 gene has been associated with seizures or other abnormal electrical activity in the brain. "
771,LGI1 ,leucine rich glioma inactivated 1,"The LGI1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (Lgi1) or epitempin. This protein is found primarily in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain, including a part of the brain called the lateral temporal lobe. The temporal lobe of the brain is involved in hearing, speech, memory, and emotion.Although researchers have proposed several functions for epitempin, its precise role in the brain remains uncertain. This protein is probably involved in normal brain development.Some studies have suggested that epitempin plays a role in the normal function of potassium channels in neurons. These channels are embedded in the cell membrane, where they transport charged potassium atoms (potassium ions) out of neurons. Potassium channels are critical for normal electrical signaling in these cells. Other studies have found that epitempin is transported (secreted) out of neurons. The function of this protein outside cells is unclear.Epitempin may also help regulate the communication between neurons. Researchers have determined that epitempin attaches (binds) to a receptor protein called ADAM22 on the surface of neurons. Together, these proteins help control the release of certain brain chemicals called neurotransmitters. These chemicals allow neighboring neurons to communicate with each other, which is how signals are relayed throughout the brain.","Autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features At least 22 mutations in the LGI1 gene have been identified in people with autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (ADPEAF). Some LGI1 mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the epitempin protein, which alters the protein's structure. Other mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the protein. Researchers suspect that the altered protein is unable to be secreted, which would leave it trapped within cells and unable to perform its usual functions. Although LGI1 mutations disrupt the function of epitempin, it is unclear how the altered protein leads to seizure activity in the brain. "
772,LHCGR ,luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor,"The LHCGR gene provides instructions for making a receptor protein called the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor. Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. Together, ligands and their receptors trigger signals that affect cell development and function.The protein produced from the LHCGR gene acts as a receptor for two ligands: luteinizing hormone and a similar hormone called chorionic gonadotropin. The receptor allows the body to respond appropriately to these hormones. In males, chorionic gonadotropin stimulates the development of cells in the testes called Leydig cells, and luteinizing hormone triggers these cells to produce androgens. Androgens, including testosterone, are the hormones that control male sexual development and reproduction. In females, luteinizing hormone triggers the release of egg cells from the ovaries (ovulation); chorionic gonadotropin is produced during pregnancy and helps maintain conditions necessary for the pregnancy to continue.","Familial male-limited precocious puberty At least 17 LHCGR gene mutations have been identified in boys and men with familial male-limited precocious puberty. These mutations replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor. The mutations cause the receptor to be constantly turned on (constitutively activated), even when not attached (bound) to luteinizing hormone or chorionic gonadotropin. Researchers suggest that the change in amino acid sequence may lead to constitutive activation by changing the shape or other properties of the receptor.In males, the overactive receptor causes the Leydig cells to produce an excess of testosterone, leading to familial male-limited precocious puberty. Affected boys begin exhibiting the signs of puberty, such as genital growth and pubic hair, between the ages of 2 and 5. The overactive receptor has no apparent effect on females. "
773,LHX1 ,LIM homeobox 1,"The LHX1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and regulates the activity of other genes. On the basis of this role, the protein produced from the LHX1 gene is called a transcription factor. The LHX1 protein is part of a large group of transcription factors called homeodomain proteins. The homeodomain is a region of the protein that allows it to bind to DNA.The LHX1 protein is found in many of the body's organs and tissues. Studies suggest that it plays particularly important roles in the development of the brain and female reproductive system.","17q12 deletion syndrome 17q12 deletion syndrome is a condition that results from the deletion of a small piece of chromosome 17 in each cell. Signs and symptoms of 17q12 deletion syndrome can include abnormalities of the kidneys, urinary tract, and reproductive system; a form of diabetes called maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 (MODY5); delayed development; intellectual disability; and behavioral or psychiatric disorders. Some females with this chromosomal change have Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome, which is characterized by underdevelopment or absence of the vagina and uterus. Features associated with 17q12 deletion syndrome vary widely, even among affected members of the same family.The part of chromosome 17 that is deleted is on the long (q) arm of the chromosome at a position designated q12. This region of the chromosome contains 15 genes, including LHX1. A deletion of this region results in a loss of one copy of the LHX1 gene in each cell, leading to a reduced amount of LHX1 protein. A shortage of this protein likely disrupts the regulation of genes that are necessary for the normal development of several organs, including the brain and female reproductive system. Researchers suspect that a loss of one copy of the LHX1 gene contributes to intellectual disability, behavioral and psychiatric conditions, and Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome in people with 17q12 deletion syndrome. "
774,LIFR ,LIF receptor alpha,"The LIFR gene provides instructions for making the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) protein. This receptor spans the cell membrane, which allows it to attach (bind) to other proteins, called ligands, outside the cell and send signals inside the cell that help the cell respond to its environment. Ligands and receptors fit together like keys into locks.LIFR acts as a receptor for a molecule known as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) as well as other ligands. LIFR signaling can control several cellular processes, including growth and division (proliferation), maturation (differentiation), and survival. First found to be important in blocking (inhibiting) growth of blood cancer (leukemia) cells, this signaling is also involved in the formation of bone and the development of nerve cells. It appears to play an important role in normal development and functioning of the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary body processes such as the regulation of breathing rate and body temperature.","Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome At least 27 mutations in the LIFR gene have been found to cause Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome. This severe condition, characterized by abnormally curved (bowed) legs, breathing problems, and episodes of dangerously high body temperature (hyperthermia), is often life-threatening in infancy. Most LIFR gene mutations involved in Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome prevent the production of any LIFR protein. Other mutations lead to production of an altered protein that likely cannot function. Without functional LIFR, signaling is impaired. The lack of LIFR signaling disrupts normal bone growth, leading to low bone mineral density (osteopenia), bowed legs, and other skeletal problems common in Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome. In addition, development of nerve cells, particularly those involved in the autonomic nervous system, is abnormal, leading to the problems with breathing, feeding, and regulating body temperature characteristic of this condition. "
775,LIMK1 ,LIM domain kinase 1,"The LIMK1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is highly active in the brain, where it is thought to be involved in the development of nerve cells. Studies suggest that this protein may play an important role in areas of the brain that are responsible for processing visual-spatial information (visuospatial constructive cognition). These parts of the brain are important for visualizing an object as a set of parts and performing tasks such as writing, drawing, constructing models, and assembling puzzles.Within cells, the LIMK1 protein likely regulates aspects of the cytoskeleton, the structural framework that helps to determine cell shape, size, and movement. The LIMK1 protein helps control the organization of actin filaments, which are long, thin fibers that make up a significant part of the cytoskeleton. Actin filaments are necessary for several normal cellular functions, such as cell division, cell movement (motility), maintenance of cell shape, transport of proteins and other molecules within cells, and chemical signaling between cells.","Williams syndrome The LIMK1 gene is located in a region of chromosome 7 that is deleted in people with Williams syndrome. As a result of this deletion, people with this condition are missing one copy of the LIMK1 gene in each cell. Some studies suggest that a loss of this gene contributes to the characteristic problems with visual-spatial tasks (such as writing and drawing) seen in Williams syndrome; however, other studies have not found this connection. Although a deletion of this gene probably affects the development and function of nerve cells in the brain, researchers have not determined how a reduction in the amount of LIMK1 protein could be related to the specific impairments seen in Williams syndrome. "
776,LIPA ,"lipase A, lysosomal acid type","The LIPA gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called lysosomal acid lipase. This enzyme is found in cell compartments called lysosomes, which digest and recycle materials the cell no longer needs. Lysosomal acid lipase breaks down fats (lipids) such as triglycerides and cholesteryl esters. Cholesteryl esters are made up of two lipids that are attached to each other, cholesterol and a fatty acid. Lysosomal acid lipase separates the cholesterol from the fatty acid. Triglycerides are stored fats that can be broken down into fatty acids that are used for energy. The lipids produced from these processes are used by the body or transported to the liver for removal.","Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency Approximately 60 mutations in the LIPA gene have been found to cause lysosomal acid lipase deficiency. This inherited condition is characterized by the accumulation of harmful amounts of lipids in cells and tissues throughout the body. Mutations in the LIPA gene lead to a shortage (deficiency) of functional lysosomal acid lipase. The severity of the condition depends on how much working enzyme is available. In individuals with a complete loss of enzyme activity, the condition begins in infancy and is often fatal. In individuals with some remaining enzyme activity, the amount of enzyme activity generally determines the severity of the condition.The most common LIPA gene mutation, found in about half of individuals with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency that begins in childhood or later, disrupts the way the gene's instructions are used to make lysosomal acid lipase. This particular mutation, called a splice-site mutation, substitutes the DNA building block (nucleotide) guanine for the nucleotide adenine near an area of the gene called exon 8 (written as IVS8-1G>A). This mutation results in the deletion of 24 protein building blocks (amino acids). People with the IVS8-1G>A mutation in both copies of the LIPA gene in each cell have 5 percent of the normal amount of lysosomal acid lipase activity.Reduction or absence of lysosomal acid lipase activity results in the accumulation of triglycerides, cholesteryl esters, and other lipids within lysosomes, causing fat buildup in multiple tissues. The body's inability to produce cholesterol from the breakdown of these lipids leads to an increase in alternative methods of cholesterol production and higher-than-normal levels of cholesterol in the blood. The excess lipids are transported to the liver for removal. Because many of them are not broken down properly, they cannot be removed from the body; instead; they accumulate in the liver, resulting in liver disease. The progressive accumulation of lipids in tissues results in organ dysfunction and the signs and symptoms of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency. "
777,LIPC ,"lipase C, hepatic type","The LIPC gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called hepatic lipase. This enzyme is produced by liver cells and released into the bloodstream where it helps with the conversion of fat-transporting molecules called very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs) to low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). The enzyme also assists in transporting molecules called high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) that carry cholesterol and triglycerides from the blood to the liver, where the HDLs deposit these fats so they can be redistributed to other tissues or removed from the body. Hepatic lipase helps to keep these fat-transporting molecules in balance by regulating the formation of LDLs and the transport of HDLs. Normally, high levels of HDL (known as ""good cholesterol"") and low levels of LDL (known as ""bad cholesterol"") are protective against heart disease.","Hepatic lipase deficiency At least 10 mutations in the LIPC gene have been found to cause hepatic lipase deficiency. This condition leads to abnormal levels of various fats (lipids) in the bloodstream, although it is unclear whether these changes impact the risk of developing heart disease. The LIPC gene mutations that cause this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the hepatic lipase enzyme. These mutations prevent the enzyme's release from the liver or decrease its activity in the bloodstream. As a result, VLDLs and IDLs are not efficiently converted into LDLs, and HDLs carrying cholesterol and triglycerides remain in the bloodstream. It is unclear what effect this change in fat levels has on people with hepatic lipase deficiency, as some affected people develop an accumulation of fatty deposits on the artery walls (atherosclerosis) and heart disease in mid-adulthood, while others do not. "
778,LIPH ,lipase H,"The LIPH gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called lipase H. This enzyme is found in many cells and tissues, where it breaks down the molecule phosphatidic acid into lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and free fatty acid. LPA is a ligand, which means that it attaches (binds) to certain proteins called receptors. A ligand and its receptor fit together like a key in a lock. LPA has multiple receptors and is involved in many cellular functions, such as cell growth and division (proliferation), cell movement (migration), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).One of LPA's receptors, the LPA6 protein, regulates the proliferation and maturation (differentiation) of cells within hair follicles, which are specialized structures in the skin where hair growth occurs. These cell processes are important for the normal development of hair follicles and for hair growth; as the cells in the hair follicle divide, the hair strand (shaft) is pushed upward and extends beyond the skin, causing the hair to grow. Lipase H is also found in the outermost layer of skin (the epidermis) and glands in the skin that produce a substance that protects the skin and hair (sebaceous glands).","Autosomal recessive hypotrichosis More than 15 mutations in the LIPH gene have been found to cause autosomal recessive hypotrichosis, a condition that results in sparse hair growth (hypotrichosis) on the scalp and, less frequently, other parts of the body. Some mutations are specific to groups with Pakistani or Japanese ancestry, or in the Mari and Chuvash populations of Russia. LIPH gene mutations lead to the production of a lipase H enzyme with little or no function. Without functional lipase H, LPA is not produced. A lack of LPA impairs many cellular functions, including the proliferation and maturation of the cells that make up hair follicles. As a result, hair follicles are structurally abnormal and often underdeveloped. Irregular hair follicles alter the structure and growth of hair shafts, leading to fragile hair that breaks easily. A lack of lipase H function in the epidermis likely contributes to the skin problems sometimes seen in individuals with autosomal recessive hypotrichosis. "
779,LMBRD1 ,LMBR1 domain containing 1,"The LMBRD1 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called LMBD1, that is involved in the conversion of vitamin B12 (also known as cobalamin) into one of two molecules, adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) or methylcobalamin (MeCbl). AdoCbl is required for the normal function of an enzyme known as methylmalonyl CoA mutase. This enzyme helps break down certain protein building blocks (amino acids), fats (lipids), and cholesterol. AdoCbl is called a cofactor because it helps methylmalonyl CoA mutase carry out its function. MeCbl is also a cofactor, but for an enzyme known as methionine synthase. This enzyme converts the amino acid homocysteine to another amino acid, methionine. The body uses methionine to make proteins and other important compounds.The LMBD1 protein is found in the membrane that surrounds cell structures called lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments within cells in which enzymes digest and recycle materials. In the lysosomal membrane, the LMBD1 protein interacts with another protein called ABCD4 (produced from the ABCD4 gene). Together, these two proteins transport vitamin B12 out of lysosomes, making it available for further processing into AdoCbl and MeCbl.Studies suggest that the LMBD1 protein is also found in the membrane that surrounds the cell (the plasma membrane). Here, the protein appears to be involved in removing another protein called the insulin receptor from the membrane. Removal of this receptor helps regulate insulin signaling, which controls blood sugar levels in the body.Another version (isoform) of the LMBD1 protein, sometimes called NESI, can also be produced from the LMBRD1 gene. This protein interacts with a region called the nuclear export signal (NES) of a protein that forms a piece of the hepatitis D virus. It is thought that interaction with NESI aids in the assembly of the virus. The hepatitis D virus can cause liver disease, although infection is rare and requires co-infection with a related virus called hepatitis B.","Methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria At least nine mutations in the LMBRD1 gene have been found to cause methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria, cblF type, one form of a disorder that causes developmental delay, eye defects, neurological problems, and blood abnormalities. LMBRD1 gene mutations involved in this condition lead to production of an abnormally short LMBD1 protein that is unable to function. A shortage of functional LMBD1 protein prevents the release of vitamin B12 from lysosomes, so the vitamin is unavailable for the production of AdoCbl and MeCbl. Because both of these cofactors are missing, the enzymes that require them (methylmalonyl CoA mutase and methionine synthase) do not function normally. As a result, certain amino acids, lipids, and cholesterol are not broken down and homocysteine cannot be converted to methionine. This dual defect results in a buildup of toxic compounds as well as homocysteine, and a decrease in the production of methionine within the body. This combination of imbalances leads to the signs and symptoms of methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria. "
780,LMNA ,lamin A/C,"The LMNA gene provides instructions for making several slightly different proteins called lamins. The two major proteins produced from this gene, lamin A and lamin C, are made in most of the body's cells. These proteins are made up of a nearly identical sequence of protein building blocks (amino acids). The small difference in the sequence makes lamin A longer than lamin C.Lamins A and C are structural proteins called intermediate filament proteins. Intermediate filaments provide stability and strength to cells. Lamins A and C are supporting (scaffolding) components of the nuclear envelope, which is a structure that surrounds the nucleus in cells. Specifically, these proteins are located in the nuclear lamina, a mesh-like layer of intermediate filaments and other proteins that is attached to the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope. The nuclear envelope regulates the movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus. Lamins A and C are also found inside the nucleus, and researchers believe the proteins may play a role in regulating the activity (expression) of certain genes.The lamin A protein must be processed within the cell before becoming part of the lamina. Its initial form, called prelamin A, undergoes a complex series of steps that are necessary for the protein to be inserted into the lamina. Lamin C does not have to undergo this processing before becoming part of the lamina.",Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Genetics Home Reference provides information about Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. 
781,LMNB1 ,lamin B1,"The LMNB1 gene provides instructions for making the lamin B1 protein. Lamin B1 is a structural protein called an intermediate filament protein. Intermediate filaments provide stability and strength to cells. Lamin B1 is a scaffolding (supporting) component of the nuclear envelope, which is the structure that surrounds the nucleus in cells. Specifically, this protein is located in the nuclear lamina, a mesh-like layer of intermediate filaments and other proteins that is attached to the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope. As part of the nuclear envelope, lamin B1 helps regulate the movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus. The protein also plays a role in the copying (replication) of DNA in preparation for cell division and the activity (expression) of many genes by being involved in the organization of chromosomes within the nucleus.","Autosomal dominant leukodystrophy with autonomic disease At least 30 mutations in the LMNB1 gene have been found to cause autosomal dominant leukodystrophy with autonomic disease (ADLD). This condition is characterized by nervous system abnormalities due to the loss of myelin, which is a fatty substance that insulates nerve fibers and promotes the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. People with ADLD begin to have autonomic nervous system problems, such as difficulty with bowel and bladder function, in their thirties or forties. The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary body processes such as the regulation of blood pressure and body temperature. Affected individuals then develop movement problems that slowly worsen over time.Nearly all cases of ADLD result from an abnormal extra copy (duplication) of the LMNB1 gene. As a result of this duplication, more lamin B1 is produced than normal. In rare cases, a deletion of genetic material near the beginning of the LMNB1 gene leading to increased production of lamin B1 causes ADLD. While lamin B1 is found in cells throughout the body, it appears that cells in the brain are especially sensitive to changes in lamin B1. Cells called oligodendrocytes, which help coat nerve cells with myelin, seem to be particularly affected. Increased lamin B1 activity leads to decreased expression of genes that are important for myelin function. Additionally, an increase in the amount of lamin B1 in cells leads to a hardening of the nuclear envelope, which can cause problems with cell function. These changes lead to reduced myelin production and maintenance over time.In at least one family with ADLD, the condition is instead caused by a loss (deletion) of genetic material near the beginning of the gene. It is thought that this deletion removes a regulatory region of DNA that helps control the expression of the LMNB1 gene. As a result of the loss of this region, LMNB1 is overexpressed and production of the lamin B1 protein is increased, similar to the cases that are caused by LMNB1 duplication.In people with ADLD, the loss of myelin (demyelination) occurs in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), often years before movement problems develop. Demyelination of the spinal cord likely contributes to the autonomic nervous system problems by impairing transmission of nerve signals from the brain to the body. The movement problems are probably due to demyelination in the region of the brain involved in coordinating movements (the cerebellum) and of the nerve cells that extend down the spinal cord (corticospinal tracts) and control voluntary muscle movement. "
782,LMX1B ,LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 beta,"The LMX1B gene provides instructions for producing a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and regulates the activity of other genes. On the basis of this role, the LMX1B protein is called a transcription factor. The LMX1B protein appears to be particularly important during early embryonic development of the limbs, kidneys, and eyes.","Nail-patella syndrome At least 145 mutations in the LMX1B gene have been found to cause nail-patella syndrome. Most mutations result in the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the LMX1B protein or change a single protein building block (amino acid). Mutations that substitute one amino acid for another amino acid reduce or eliminate the protein's ability to bind to DNA, disrupting the regulation of other genes during early development. Deletions of the entire LMX1B gene or large portions of the gene have also been shown to cause nail patella syndrome. It is unclear exactly how mutations in the LMX1B gene lead to the signs and symptoms of nail-patella syndrome. "
783,LORICRIN ,loricrin,"The LORICRIN gene is part of a cluster of genes on chromosome 1 called the epidermal differentiation complex. These genes are involved in the formation and maintenance of the outer layer of skin (the epidermis), particularly its tough outer surface (the stratum corneum). The stratum corneum, which is formed in a process known as cornification, provides a sturdy barrier between the body and its environment. Each cell of the stratum corneum, called a corneocyte, is surrounded by a protein shell called a cornified envelope.The LORICRIN gene provides instructions for making a protein called loricrin, which is a major component of the cornified envelope. Links between loricrin and other components of the envelopes hold the corneocytes together and help give the stratum corneum its strength.","Vohwinkel syndrome At least two mutations in the LORICRIN gene have been identified in people with the variant form of Vohwinkel syndrome, sometimes called loricrin keratoderma. This disorder is characterized by skin abnormalities including widespread dry, scaly skin (ichthyosis), especially on the limbs. The mutations that cause the variant form of Vohwinkel syndrome change the structure of the loricrin protein; the altered protein is trapped inside the cell and cannot reach the cornified envelope. While other proteins can partially compensate for the missing loricrin, the envelope of some of the corneocytes is thinner than normal, resulting in the dry, scaly skin (ichthyosis) and other skin abnormalities associated with the variant form of Vohwinkel syndrome. "
784,LPAR6 ,lysophosphatidic acid receptor 6,"The LPAR6 gene provides instructions for making a protein called lysophosphatidic acid receptor 6 (LPA6). This protein functions as a receptor. Receptor proteins have particular sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. A specific fat called lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is the ligand for the LPA6 protein. LPA can attach to many receptors, but LPA6 is the only LPA receptor found in hair follicles. Hair follicles are specialized structures in the skin where hair growth occurs. As the cells in the hair follicle divide, the hair strand (shaft) is pushed upward and extends beyond the skin, causing the hair to grow. The LPA6 protein is also found in the outermost layer of skin (the epidermis). Attachment of LPA to LPA6 helps regulate the growth and division (proliferation) and maturation (differentiation) of cells in the hair follicle.","Autosomal recessive hypotrichosis More than 30 LPAR6 gene mutations have been found to cause autosomal recessive hypotrichosis, a condition that results in sparse hair growth (hypotrichosis) on the scalp and, less frequently, other parts of the body. Some mutations are specific to populations with Pakistani ancestry. LPAR6 gene mutations lead to the production of an abnormal LPA6 protein that cannot bind to LPA to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation within hair follicles. As a result, hair follicles are structurally abnormal and often underdeveloped. Irregular hair follicles alter the structure and growth of hair shafts, leading to fragile hair that breaks easily. A lack of LPA6 protein function in the epidermis likely contributes to the skin problems sometimes seen in individuals with autosomal recessive hypotrichosis. "
785,LPIN2 ,lipin 2,The LPIN2 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called lipin-2. Researchers believe that this protein may play a role in the processing of fats (lipid metabolism). It may also be involved in controlling inflammation and in cell division.,"Majeed syndrome At least three mutations in the LPIN2 gene have been identified in people with Majeed syndrome. These mutations alter the structure and function of lipin-2, leading to chronic, abnormal inflammation in some of the body's tissues. It is unclear how LPIN2 gene mutations lead to the specific features of Majeed syndrome, including bone disease, a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), and inflammatory skin disorders. "
786,LPL ,lipoprotein lipase,"The LPL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase. This enzyme is found primarily on the surface of cells that line tiny blood vessels (capillaries) within muscles and in fatty (adipose) tissue. Lipoprotein lipase plays a critical role in breaking down fat in the form of triglycerides, which are carried from various organs to the blood by molecules called lipoproteins.Lipoprotein lipase breaks down triglycerides carried by two different types of lipoproteins, which bring fat to the bloodstream from different organs. Fat from the intestine, which is taken in from the diet, is transported to the bloodstream by lipoproteins called chylomicrons. Another type of lipoprotein called very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) carries triglycerides from the liver to the bloodstream. When lipoprotein lipase breaks down triglycerides, the fat molecules are used by the body as energy or stored in fatty tissue for later use.","Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency More than 220 mutations in the LPL gene have been found to cause familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency. This condition disrupts the normal breakdown of triglycerides in the body, resulting in an increase of these fats. The most common mutation in people of European ancestry replaces the protein building block (amino acid) glycine with the amino acid glutamic acid at position 188 in the enzyme (written as Gly188Glu or G188E). Mutations that cause familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency reduce or eliminate lipoprotein lipase activity, which prevents the enzyme from effectively breaking down triglycerides in the bloodstream. As a result, triglycerides attached to lipoproteins accumulate in the blood and tissues, leading to inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), fatty deposits in the skin (eruptive xanthomas), and the other signs and symptoms of familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency. "
787,LRP2 ,LDL receptor related protein 2,"The LRP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called megalin, which functions as a receptor. Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. Together, ligands and their receptors trigger signals that affect cell development and function. Megalin has many ligands involved in various body processes, including the absorption of vitamins A and D, immune functioning, stress response, and the transport of fats in the bloodstream.Megalin is embedded in the membrane of cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body (epithelial cells). The receptor helps move its ligands from the cell surface into the cell (endocytosis), and is also involved in transporting the ligands of a related receptor called cubulin. Megalin is active in the development and function of many parts of the body, including the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), eyes, ears, lungs, intestine, reproductive system, and the small tubes in the kidneys where urine is formed (renal tubules).","Donnai-Barrow syndrome At least twelve LRP2 gene mutations have been identified in people with Donnai-Barrow syndrome. These mutations are believed to result in the absence of functional megalin protein. The lack of functional megalin in the renal tubules causes megalin's various ligands to be excreted in the urine rather than being absorbed back into the bloodstream. The features of Donnai-Barrow syndrome are probably caused by the inability of megalin to help absorb these ligands, disruption of biochemical signaling pathways, or other effects of the nonfunctional megalin protein. However, it is unclear how these abnormalities result in the specific signs and symptoms of the disorder.A condition previously classified as a separate disorder called facio-oculo-acoustico-renal (FOAR) syndrome has also been found to be caused by LRP2 gene mutations. FOAR syndrome is now considered to be the same disorder as Donnai-Barrow syndrome. "
788,LRP5 ,LDL receptor related protein 5,"The LRP5 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is embedded in the outer membrane of many types of cells. It is known as a co-receptor because it works with another receptor protein, frizzled-4 (produced from the FZD4 gene), to transmit chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. Frizzled-4 and the LRP5 protein participate in the Wnt signaling pathway, a series of steps that affect the way cells and tissues develop. Wnt signaling is important for cell division (proliferation), attachment of cells to one another (adhesion), cell movement (migration), and many other cellular activities.The LRP5 protein plays an important role in the development and maintenance of several tissues. During early development, it helps guide the specialization of cells in the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. The LRP5 protein is also involved in establishing a blood supply to the retina and the inner ear. Additionally, this protein helps regulate bone mineral density, which is a measure of the amount of calcium and other minerals in bones. The minerals give the bones strength, making them less likely to break.","Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy More than 15 mutations in the LRP5 gene have been identified in people with the eye disease familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. Some of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the LRP5 protein, while others insert or delete genetic material in the gene. Most of these mutations reduce the amount of functional LRP5 protein that is produced within cells.A reduction in the amount of LRP5 protein disrupts chemical signaling in the developing eye, which interferes with the formation of blood vessels at the edges of the retina. The resulting abnormal blood supply to this tissue can lead to retinal damage and vision loss. Because the LRP5 protein plays a role in bone formation, LRP5 gene mutations also cause reduced bone mineral density in some people with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. "
789,LRRK2 ,leucine rich repeat kinase 2,"The LRRK2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called dardarin. The LRRK2 gene is active in the brain and other tissues throughout the body.One segment of the dardarin protein is called a leucine-rich region because it contains a large amount of a protein building block (amino acid) known as leucine. Proteins with leucine-rich regions appear to play a role in activities that require interactions with other proteins, such as transmitting signals or helping to assemble the cell's structural framework (cytoskeleton). Other parts of the dardarin protein are also thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions.Additional studies indicate that dardarin has an enzyme function known as kinase activity. Proteins with kinase activity assist in the transfer of a phosphate group (a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms) from the energy molecule ATP to amino acids in certain proteins. This phosphate transfer is called phosphorylation, and it is an essential step in turning on and off many cell activities. Dardarin also has a second enzyme function referred to as a GTPase activity. This activity is associated with a region of the protein called the ROC domain. The ROC domain may help control the overall shape of the dardarin protein.","Parkinson disease Researchers have identified more than 100 LRRK2 gene mutations in families with late-onset Parkinson disease (the most common form of the disorder, which appears after age 50). These mutations replace single amino acids in the dardarin protein, which affects the protein's structure and function. It is unclear how LRRK2 gene mutations lead to the movement and balance problems characteristic of Parkinson disease.A mutation that replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid glycine at protein position 1441 (written as Arg1441Gly or R1441G) is a relatively common cause of Parkinson disease in the Basque region between France and Spain. The protein name dardarin comes from the Basque word ""dardara,"" which means tremor, a characteristic feature of Parkinson disease.Studies of several different populations from around the world revealed a common LRRK2 gene mutation in 3 to 7 percent of familial Parkinson disease cases. This mutation replaces the amino acid glycine with the amino acid serine at protein position 2019 (written as Gly2019Ser or G2019S). The incidence of the Gly2019Ser mutation in familial cases is highest among Arabs from North Africa and people of Ashkenazi (eastern and central European) Jewish ancestry, and it is lowest in Asian and northern European populations. This particular mutation has also been reported in 1 to 3 percent of sporadic Parkinson disease cases, in which there is no family history of the disease.Studies in Chinese and Japanese populations have identified an LRRK2 gene mutation that occurs more frequently in people with Parkinson disease than in people without the disease. This mutation replaces the amino acid glycine with the amino acid arginine at protein position 2385 (written as Gly2385Arg or G2385R). This mutation appears to increase the risk of Parkinson disease among people in these populations. "
790,LYST ,lysosomal trafficking regulator,"The LYST gene (also known as CHS1) provides instructions for making a protein known as the lysosomal trafficking regulator. Researchers believe that this protein plays a role in the transport (trafficking) of materials into structures called lysosomes. Lysosomes act as recycling centers within cells. They use digestive enzymes to break down toxic substances, digest bacteria that invade the cell, and recycle worn-out cell components. Although the lysosomal trafficking regulator protein is involved in the normal function of lysosomes, its exact role is unknown. Studies suggest that this protein may help determine the size of lysosomes and regulate their movement within cells.","Chediak-Higashi syndrome At least 30 mutations in the LYST gene have been identified in people with Chediak-Higashi syndrome. These mutations impair the normal function of the lysosomal trafficking regulator protein, which disrupts the size, structure, and function of lysosomes and related structures within cells.LYST mutations that cause the severe, childhood form of Chediak-Higashi syndrome typically result in the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the lysosomal trafficking regulator protein. The mutations responsible for the milder, adult version of this disease usually change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the protein. In these cases, the altered protein may retain some function.People with LYST mutations have abnormally large lysosomes and related structures in cells throughout the body. These enlarged structures interfere with normal cell functions. For example, enlarged lysosomes in certain immune system cells prevent these cells from responding appropriately to bacteria and other foreign invaders. As a result, the malfunctioning immune system cannot protect the body from severe, recurrent infections.In pigment cells called melanocytes, cellular structures called melanosomes (which are related to lysosomes) are abnormally large. These structures produce and distribute a pigment called melanin, which is the substance that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color. People with Chediak-Higashi syndrome have oculocutaneous albinism because melanin is trapped within the giant melanosomes and is unable to contribute to skin, hair, and eye pigmentation.Researchers believe that abnormal lysosome-like structures inside blood cells called platelets underlie the abnormal bruising and bleeding seen in people with Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Similarly, abnormal lysosomes in nerve cells probably cause the neurological problems associated with this disease. "
791,LZTR1 ,leucine zipper like transcription regulator 1,"The LZTR1 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose exact function is unknown. The LZTR1 protein is made in cells throughout the body. Within cells, it is found in the Golgi apparatus, which is a structure in which newly produced proteins are modified. Studies suggest that the LZTR1 protein may help stabilize this structure. Researchers suspect that this protein may also be associated with the CUL3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is part of the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unneeded proteins.Based on its role in several tumor types, the LZTR1 protein is thought to act as a tumor suppressor. Tumor suppressors are proteins that keep cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.","Schwannomatosis More than 50 different mutations in the LZTR1 gene have been found in people with schwannomatosis, a disorder characterized by multiple noncancerous (benign) tumors called schwannomas that grow on nerves. This type of tumor arises from Schwann cells, which are specialized cells that normally form an insulating layer around the nerve.LZTR1 gene mutations associated with schwannomatosis lead to production of an altered LZTR1 protein that is less able to control cell growth and division, which allows tumors to develop. It is unknown why these gene mutations are predominantly associated with schwannomas, instead of other types of tumor, in people with schwannomatosis.It appears that mutations in the LZTR1 gene alone are not enough to trigger the development of schwannomas. Additional genetic changes (somatic mutations) that are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells may also be required for schwannomas to form.Some people who have a mutation in the LZTR1 gene never develop tumors, which is a situation known as reduced penetrance. "
792,MAGT1 ,magnesium transporter 1,"The MAGT1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called a magnesium transporter, which moves charged atoms (ions) of magnesium (Mg2+) into certain immune system cells called T cells. T cells recognize foreign invaders, such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi, and are then turned on (activated) to attack these invaders in order to prevent infection and illness. Specifically, the magnesium transporter produced from the MAGT1 gene is active in CD8+ T cells, which are especially important in controlling viral infections such as the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). These cells normally take in magnesium when they detect a foreign invader, and the magnesium is involved in activating the T cell's response.Researchers suggest that magnesium transport may also be involved in the production of another type of T cell called helper T cells (CD4+ T cells) in a gland called the thymus. CD4+ T cells direct and assist the functions of the immune system by influencing the activities of other immune system cells.","X-linked immunodeficiency with magnesium defect, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and neoplasia At least five MAGT1 gene mutations that cause X-linked immunodeficiency with magnesium defect, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and neoplasia (typically known by the acronym XMEN) have been identified. XMEN is a disorder that affects the immune system in males. It involves chronic EBV infection and an increased risk of a cancer of immune system cells called lymphoma. The word ""neoplasia"" in the condition name refers to these lymphomas; neoplasia is a general term meaning abnormal growths of tissue.MAGT1 gene mutations impair the magnesium transporter's function, reducing the amount of magnesium that gets into T cells. This magnesium deficiency prevents the efficient activation of the T cells to target EBV and other infections. Uncontrolled EBV infection increases the likelihood of developing lymphoma. Impaired production of CD4+ T cells resulting from abnormal magnesium transport likely accounts for the deficiency of this type of T cell in individuals with XMEN, contributing to the decreased ability to prevent infection and illness. "
793,MAN2B1 ,mannosidase alpha class 2B member 1,"The MAN2B1 gene provides instructions for making the enzyme alpha-mannosidase. This enzyme works in the lysosomes, which are compartments that digest and recycle materials in the cell. Within lysosomes, the enzyme helps break down complexes of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) attached to certain proteins (glycoproteins). In particular, alpha-mannosidase helps break down oligosaccharides containing a sugar molecule called mannose.","Alpha-mannosidosis More than 120 mutations in the MAN2B1 gene have been identified in people with alpha-mannosidosis, a rare inherited disorder that causes problems in many organs and tissues of the body. Affected individuals may have intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and skeletal abnormalities. Some of the MAN2B1 gene mutations that cause alpha-mannosidosis change one protein building block (amino acid) in the alpha-mannosidase enzyme. Other mutations result in an abnormally shortened enzyme, or cause the enzyme to be pieced together incorrectly.These mutations interfere with the ability of the alpha-mannosidase enzyme to perform its role in breaking down mannose-containing oligosaccharides. These oligosaccharides accumulate in the lysosomes and cause the cells to malfunction and eventually die. Tissues and organs are damaged by the abnormal accumulation of oligosaccharides and the resulting cell death, leading to the characteristic features of alpha-mannosidosis. "
794,MANBA ,mannosidase beta,"The MANBA gene provides instructions for making the enzyme beta-mannosidase. This enzyme works in the lysosomes, which are compartments that digest and recycle materials in the cell. Within lysosomes, the enzyme helps break down complexes of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) attached to certain proteins (glycoproteins). Beta-mannosidase is involved in the last step of this process, helping to break down complexes of two sugar molecules (disaccharides) containing a sugar molecule called mannose.","Beta-mannosidosis Approximately 12 mutations that cause beta-mannosidosis have been identified in the MANBA gene. The mutations result in a beta-mannosidase enzyme with little or no activity, and interfere with the ability of the enzyme to perform its role in breaking down mannose-containing disaccharides. These disaccharides gradually accumulate in the lysosomes and cause cells to malfunction, resulting in the signs and symptoms of beta-mannosidosis. "
795,MAOA ,monoamine oxidase A,"The MAOA gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called monoamine oxidase A. This enzyme is part of a family of enzymes that break down molecules called monoamines through a chemical reaction known as oxidation. Among the monoamines broken down by monoamine oxidase A are certain chemicals that act as neurotransmitters, which transmit signals between nerve cells in the brain. Neurotransmitters are broken down when signaling is no longer needed.Specifically, monoamine oxidase A is involved in the breakdown of the neurotransmitters serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Signals transmitted by serotonin regulate mood, emotion, sleep, and appetite. Epinephrine and norepinephrine control the body's response to stress. Dopamine transmits signals within the brain to produce smooth physical movements.Monoamine oxidase A also helps break down monoamines found in the diet. It seems to be particularly important in the breakdown of excess tyramine, which is found in cheese and other foods.Monoamine oxidase A appears to be involved in normal brain development before birth. The enzyme plays a role in the controlled self-destruction of cells (apoptosis), which is an important process in the development of many tissues and organs, including the brain.","Monoamine oxidase A deficiency Mutations in the MAOA gene cause monoamine oxidase A deficiency. This condition affects males almost exclusively and is characterized by mild intellectual disability and behavioral problems, including aggressive and violent outbursts. In some cases, particular foods seem to worsen symptoms of the condition. The MAOA gene mutations reduce monoamine oxidase A activity, which causes serotonin and other neurotransmitters to build up in the brain. It is unclear how this buildup leads to the signs and symptoms of monoamine oxidase A deficiency. Researchers speculate that an excess of certain neurotransmitters, particularly serotonin and norepinephrine, may impair an affected individual's ability to control his impulses, leading to aggressive outbursts. Some studies suggest that reduced monoamine oxidase A activity alters development of certain regions of the brain, which may contribute to intellectual disability and behavioral problems in people with monoamine oxidase A deficiency. Researchers suspect that a buildup of tyramine can contribute to the problems associated with the condition, which may be why foods high in this molecule can worsen symptoms. "
796,MAP2K1 ,mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1,"The MAP2K1 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as MEK1 protein kinase. This protein is part of a signaling pathway called the RAS/MAPK pathway, which transmits chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. RAS/MAPK signaling helps control the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (migration), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). MEK1 protein kinase appears to be essential for normal development before birth and for survival after birth.","Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome At least 13 mutations in the MAP2K1 gene have been identified in people with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. This condition affects many parts of the body, particularly the heart (cardio-), facial features (facio-), and the skin and hair (-cutaneous).The MAP2K1 gene mutations that cause cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome are germline mutations, which means that they are present in cells throughout the body. Each mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in MEK1 protein kinase. The genetic changes abnormally activate the protein, which disrupts the tightly regulated RAS/MAPK signaling pathway in many types of cells. The altered signaling interferes with the normal development of many organs and tissues, resulting in the characteristic features of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. "
797,MAP2K2 ,mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 2,"The MAP2K2 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as MEK2 protein kinase. This protein is part of a signaling pathway called the RAS/MAPK pathway, which transmits chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. RAS/MAPK signaling helps control the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement, and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).The MAP2K2 gene is very similar to a gene called MAP2K1, which provides instructions for making a protein known as MEK1 protein kinase. Like MEK2 protein kinase, this protein functions as part of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. Together, the MEK1 and MEK2 protein kinases appear to be essential for normal development before birth and for survival after birth.","Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome At least 13 mutations in the MAP2K2 gene have been identified in people with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in MEK2 protein kinase, although one mutation deletes several amino acids from the protein. These genetic changes abnormally activate MEK2 kinase, which disrupts the tightly regulated RAS/MAPK signaling pathway in cells throughout the body. The altered signaling interferes with the normal development of many organs and tissues, resulting in the characteristic features of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. "
798,MAP3K1 ,mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1,"The MAP3K1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps regulate signaling pathways that control various processes in the body, including the processes of determining sexual characteristics before birth. The MAP3K1 protein attaches (binds) to other molecules called RHOA, MAP3K4, FRAT1, and AXIN1. The binding of MAP3K1 to these molecules, which are called cofactors, helps MAP3K1 control the activity of the signaling pathways.","Swyer syndrome Mutations in the MAP3K1 gene are thought to account for up to 18 percent of cases of Swyer syndrome, a condition affecting sexual development also known as 46,XY complete gonadal dysgenesis or 46,XY pure gonadal dysgenesis.People usually have 46 chromosomes in each cell. Two of the 46 chromosomes, known as X and Y, are called sex chromosomes because they help determine whether a person will develop male or female sex characteristics. Girls and women typically have two X chromosomes (46,XX karyotype), while boys and men usually have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (46,XY karyotype).The MAP3K1 gene mutations that cause Swyer syndrome increase cofactor binding, which decreases signaling that leads to male sexual differentiation and enhances signaling that leads to female sexual differentiation. As a result, affected individuals with a typically male 46,XY karyotype will not develop male gonads (testes) but will develop female reproductive structures (a uterus and fallopian tubes). "
799,MAPT ,microtubule associated protein tau,"The MAPT gene provides instructions for making a protein called tau. This protein is found throughout the nervous system, including in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. It is involved in assembling and stabilizing microtubules, which are rigid, hollow fibers that make up the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton). Microtubules help cells maintain their shape, assist in the process of cell division, and are essential for the transport of materials within cells.Six different versions (isoforms) of the tau protein are produced in the adult brain. The isoforms vary in length from 352 to 441 protein building blocks (amino acids). A region of the protein called the microtubule-binding domain, which is the part of the protein that attaches (binds) to microtubules, also varies among the isoforms. In three of the isoforms, the microtubule-binding domain contains three repeated segments. In the other three isoforms, this domain contains four repeated segments. Typically, the brain has approximately the same amount of three-repeat isoforms and four-repeat isoforms. This balance appears to be essential for the normal function of neurons.","Frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism-17 More than 40 mutations in the MAPT gene have been found to cause frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism-17 (FTDP-17). Some of these mutations change single amino acids in the tau protein, most often in the microtubule-binding region. These mutations reduce tau's ability to bind to microtubules, which disrupts many important cell functions.Other MAPT gene mutations change the way the gene's instructions are used to build the tau protein. Most of these mutations increase the production of tau with four repeated segments compared to the production of tau with three repeated segments. The resulting imbalance of tau isoforms in the brain interferes with the normal functions of brain cells.In ways that are not fully understood, the MAPT gene mutations responsible for FTDP-17 lead to an accumulation of abnormal tau in neurons and other brain cells. These clumps of defective tau build up over time, although it is unclear what effect they have on cell function and survival. FTDP-17 is characterized by the gradual death of cells in areas of the brain called the frontal and temporal lobes. The frontal lobes are involved in reasoning, planning, judgment, and problem-solving, while the temporal lobes help process hearing, speech, memory, and emotion. The loss of cells in these brain regions leads to the major features of FTDP-17, including changes in personality and behavior, speech and language abnormalities, and problems with movement. "
800,MASP1 ,mannan binding lectin serine peptidase 1,"The MASP1 gene provides instructions for making proteins that are involved in a series of steps called the lectin complement pathway. This pathway is thought to help direct the movement (migration) of cells during development before birth to form the organs and systems of the body. It appears to be particularly important in directing the migration of neural crest cells. These cells give rise to various tissues including many tissues in the face and skull, the glands that produce hormones (endocrine glands), and portions of the nervous system. After birth, the lectin complement pathway is involved in the immune system.Proteins called MASP-1, MASP-3, and MAp44 can be produced from the MASP1 gene, depending on how the gene's instructions are pieced together. These proteins differ at one end of their structure. The MASP-1 and MASP-3 proteins have different versions of regions called serine protease domains, while the MAp44 protein has no serine protease domain. Researchers are studying whether these proteins play different roles in the lectin complement pathway.","3MC syndrome At least 11 MASP1 gene mutations have been identified in people with 3MC syndrome, a disorder characterized by unusual facial features and a variety of problems affecting other tissues and organs of the body. Because all of the MASP1 gene mutations that cause 3MC syndrome affect the MASP-3 protein, alterations in this protein's function are thought to account for the signs and symptoms of 3MC syndrome. Because parts of the three protein versions are the same, some of the MASP1 gene mutations affect the other protein versions in addition to affecting MASP-3.The protein changes result in faulty control of cell migration in early development, leading to the various abnormalities that occur in this disorder. Researchers suggest that similar pathways in the immune system can compensate for problems in the lectin complement pathway, which explains why immune system abnormalities are not part of 3MC syndrome. "
801,MAT1A ,methionine adenosyltransferase 1A,"The MAT1A gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase. The enzyme is produced from the MAT1A gene in two forms, designated alpha and beta. The alpha form, called a homotetramer, is made up of four identical protein subunits. The beta form, called a homodimer, is made up of two of the same protein subunits. Both forms of the enzyme are found in the liver.Both the alpha and beta forms of methionine adenosyltransferase help break down a protein building block (amino acid) called methionine. The enzyme starts the reaction that converts methionine to S-adenosylmethionine, also called AdoMet or SAMe. AdoMet is involved in transferring methyl groups, consisting of a carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms, to other compounds, a process called transmethylation. Transmethylation is important in many cellular processes. These include determining whether the instructions in a particular segment of DNA are carried out, regulating reactions involving proteins and lipids, and controlling the processing of chemicals that relay signals in the nervous system (neurotransmitters).","Hypermethioninemia Approximately 15 mutations in the MAT1A gene have been found to reduce the activity of the methionine adenosyltransferase enzyme. Most of these mutations substitute one amino acid for another amino acid in the enzyme, causing it to process methionine less efficiently. Other mutations introduce a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the methionine adenosyltransferase enzyme. As a result, a shortened, nonfunctional enzyme is produced. A reduction in methionine adenosyltransferase function results in a buildup of methionine in the body and less efficient AdoMet production, and in severe cases can cause neurological problems. "
802,MATN3 ,matrilin 3,"The MATN3 gene provides the instructions for making a protein called matrilin-3. This protein is found in the extracellular matrix, which is an intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. Specifically, matrilin-3 is located in the extracellular matrix surrounding the cells that make up ligaments and tendons, and near cartilage-forming cells (chondrocytes). Chondrocytes play an important role in bone formation (osteogenesis). In the bones of the spine, hips, and limbs, the process of osteogenesis starts with the formation of cartilage, which is then converted into bone.The normal function of the MATN3 gene is not fully understood; however, research suggests that matrilin-3 may play a role in the organization of collagen and other cartilage proteins. Collagens are proteins that provide strength and support to many body tissues, including cartilage. Matrilin-3 has been shown to interact with the COMP protein, type II collagen, and type IX collagen, which are all important in cartilage and bone formation.","Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia At least 14 different mutations in the MATN3 gene have been shown to cause a mild form of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. All of the mutations change one protein building block (amino acid) within or close to a region of matrilin-3 called the A-domain. One genetic change accounts for approximately 40 percent of all MATN3 mutations. This mutation replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid tryptophan at position 121 (written as Arg121Trp or R121W).Researchers believe that mutations in the MATN3 gene prevent matrilin-3 from folding properly. Instead of being transported to the extracellular matrix of the chondrocytes, matrilin-3 remains in the endoplasmic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum is a structure inside the cell that is involved in protein processing and transport. This cell structure eventually becomes so large that it is no longer able to function normally, and the chondrocyte dies. The premature death of chondrocytes results in diminished growth of the long bones and short stature. "
803,MATR3 ,matrin 3,"The MATR3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called matrin 3, which is found in the nucleus of the cell as part of the nuclear matrix. The nuclear matrix is a network of proteins that provides structural support for the nucleus and aids in several important nuclear functions.The function of the matrin 3 protein is unknown. This protein can attach to (bind) RNA, which is a chemical cousin of DNA. Some studies indicate that matrin 3 binds and stabilizes a type of RNA called messenger RNA (mRNA), which provides the genetic blueprint for proteins. Matrin 3 may also bind certain abnormal RNAs that could lead to nonfunctional or harmful proteins, thereby blocking the formation of such proteins. Other studies suggest that the matrin 3 protein may be involved in cell survival.","Distal myopathy 2 At least one mutation in the MATR3 gene has been identified in people with distal myopathy 2, a condition characterized by muscle and vocal cord weakness. The MATR3 gene mutation associated with distal myopathy 2 changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the matrin 3 protein. This mutation, known as Ser85Cys (or S85C), replaces the amino acid serine with the amino acid cysteine at position 85 of the protein.The effect of the S85C mutation on the function of the matrin 3 protein is unknown, although one study indicates that the mutation may change the location of the protein in the nucleus. Researchers are working to determine how this gene mutation leads to the signs and symptoms of distal myopathy 2. "
804,MBD5 ,methyl-CpG binding domain protein 5,"The MBD5 gene is one of a family of genes called the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) genes. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that help regulate gene activity (expression) by modifying chromatin, the complex of DNA and protein that packages DNA into chromosomes. The MBD5 protein is likely involved in regulating gene expression and controlling the production of proteins that are involved in neurological functions such as learning, memory, and behavior. The MBD5 protein also seems to play a role in the growth and division (proliferation) and maturation (differentiation) of various types of cells.","MBD5-associated neurodevelopmental disorder Mutations in the MBD5 gene have been found to cause MBD5-associated neurodevelopmental disorder (MAND). MAND is a condition that affects neurological and physical development from birth. Affected individuals often have intellectual disability, developmental delay, impaired speech, sleep problems, distinctive facial features, and mild hand and foot abnormalities. Most people with MAND also have behavior problems similar to autism spectrum disorder, a developmental condition that affects communication and social interaction.Some MBD5 gene mutations that cause MAND delete large segments of the MBD5 gene or result in the production of an altered protein with no function. These mutations affect one copy of the gene in each cell. As a result, there is less MBD5 protein available to regulate the expression of certain genes, leading to uncontrolled protein production. Proteins that play a role in neurological functions are particularly affected, which helps explain why MAND impacts brain development and behavior.Additionally, an extra copy of the MBD5 gene or a loss of the whole gene in each cell can cause MAND. In these cases, MAND results from abnormal copying (duplication) or removal (deletion) of a small piece of the long (q) arm of chromosome 2 at position 2q23.1. The duplicated or deleted segments can vary in size but always include the MBD5 gene, and often additional genes. Researchers believe that MBD5 gene changes underlie most of the signs and symptoms of MAND. Features of the condition generally do not differ based on the genetic cause, although they can vary between individuals. "
805,MBL2 ,mannose binding lectin 2,"The MBL2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that assembles into a protein complex called mannose-binding lectin. Functional mannose-binding lectins are made up of two to six protein groups called trimers, which are each composed of three of the protein pieces (subunits) produced from the MBL2 gene. This protein complex plays an important role in the immune system's response to foreign invaders (pathogens).Mannose-binding lectin recognizes and attaches (binds) to sugars, such as mannose, fucose, and glucose, that are found on the surface of bacteria, viruses, and yeast. This binding turns on (activates) the complement system, which is a group of immune system proteins that work together to destroy pathogens, trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. Attachment of mannose-binding lectin also targets the pathogen to be engulfed and broken down by special immune cells. Recognition of foreign invaders by mannose-binding lectin provides one of the body's first lines of defense against infection.","Mannose-binding lectin deficiency Several common mutations of the MBL2 gene can lead to a condition called mannose-binding lectin deficiency. People with this condition have low levels of mannose-binding lectin and may be susceptible to recurrent infections. Several of the disease-associated mutations occur in a region of the MBL2 gene known as exon 1 and result in a change to single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the mannose-binding lectin subunit. Other mutations occur in an area of DNA near the MBL2 gene called the promoter region, which helps control the production of the mannose-binding lectin subunit.The change of a single amino acid in the mannose-binding lectin subunit eliminates its ability to assemble into the functional mannose-binding lectin. Similarly, certain mutations in the promoter region of the MBL2 gene reduce production of the mannose-binding lectin subunit, leading to a decreased number of subunits available for protein assembly and a reduction in the amount of functional protein. With decreased levels of mannose-binding lectin, the body does not recognize and fight foreign invaders efficiently. Consequently, infections can be more common in people with this condition. However, researchers believe that a number of factors, including other genetic and environmental factors, are involved in the development of mannose-binding lectin deficiency. "
806,MC1R ,melanocortin 1 receptor,"The MC1R gene provides instructions for making a protein called the melanocortin 1 receptor. This receptor plays an important role in normal pigmentation. The receptor is primarily located on the surface of melanocytes, which are specialized cells that produce a pigment called melanin. Melanin is the substance that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color. Melanin is also found in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina), where it plays a role in normal vision.Melanocytes make two forms of melanin, eumelanin and pheomelanin. The relative amounts of these two pigments help determine the color of a person's hair and skin. People who produce mostly eumelanin tend to have brown or black hair and dark skin that tans easily. Eumelanin also protects skin from damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation in sunlight. People who produce mostly pheomelanin tend to have red or blond hair, freckles, and light-colored skin that tans poorly. Because pheomelanin does not protect skin from UV radiation, people with more pheomelanin have an increased risk of skin damage caused by sun exposure.The melanocortin 1 receptor controls which type of melanin is produced by melanocytes. When the receptor is activated, it triggers a series of chemical reactions inside melanocytes that stimulate these cells to make eumelanin. If the receptor is not activated or is blocked, melanocytes make pheomelanin instead of eumelanin.Common variations (polymorphisms) in the MC1R gene are associated with normal differences in skin and hair color. Certain genetic variations are most common in people with red hair, fair skin, freckles, and an increased sensitivity to sun exposure. These MC1R polymorphisms reduce the ability of the melanocortin 1 receptor to stimulate eumelanin production, causing melanocytes to make mostly pheomelanin. Although MC1R is a key gene in normal human pigmentation, researchers believe that the effects of other genes also contribute to a person's hair and skin coloring.The melanocortin 1 receptor is also active in cells other than melanocytes, including cells involved in the body's immune and inflammatory responses. The receptor's function in these cells is unknown.","Melanoma Certain variations in the MC1R gene increase the risk of developing melanoma, a type of skin cancer that begins in melanocytes. These variations reduce the ability of the melanocortin 1 receptor to stimulate eumelanin production in melanocytes, resulting in fair skin. Because eumelanin normally protects skin from the harmful effects of UV radiation, a lack of this pigment leaves skin more vulnerable to damage from sun exposure. Skin damage caused by UV radiation from the sun is a major risk factor for developing melanoma.Studies suggest that other variations in the MC1R gene may also increase the risk of developing melanoma in the absence of UV radiation-related skin damage. In these cases, melanomas can occur in people of dark or light skin coloring. These cancers are often associated with mutations in additional genes related to melanoma risk, such as the BRAF and CDKN2A genes. Researchers are working to explain the complex relationship among MC1R variations, other genetic and environmental factors, and melanoma risk. "
807,MC2R ,melanocortin 2 receptor,"The MC2R gene provides instructions for making a protein called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) receptor. This protein is found primarily in the adrenal glands, which are hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. The ACTH receptor is embedded in the membrane of cells where it attaches (binds) to ACTH. ACTH is a hormone that is released by the pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain. The binding of ACTH to its receptor triggers the adrenal glands to produce a group of hormones called glucocorticoids. These hormones, which include cortisol and corticosterone, aid in immune system function, play a role in maintaining normal blood sugar levels, help trigger nerve cell signaling in the brain, and serve many other purposes in the body.The ACTH receptor also likely plays a role in the development of the adrenal glands before birth.","Familial glucocorticoid deficiency More than 40 mutations in the MC2R gene have been found to cause familial glucocorticoid deficiency. This condition is characterized by potentially life-threatening low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), recurrent infections, and skin coloring darker than that of other family members (hyperpigmentation). MC2R gene mutations account for approximately 25 percent of cases of this condition. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ACTH receptor. As a result, the receptor cannot be transported to the cell membrane or bind to ACTH. Without the binding of the ACTH receptor to its hormone, there is no signal to trigger the adrenal glands to produce glucocorticoids. A shortage of these hormones impairs blood sugar regulation, immune system function, and other cellular functions, leading to the signs and symptoms of familial glucocorticoid deficiency. "
808,MCCC1 ,methylcrotonoyl-CoA carboxylase 1,"The MCCC1 gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha subunit) of an enzyme called 3-methylcrotonoyl-CoA carboxylase or 3-MCC. Alpha subunits join with smaller beta subunits made from the MCCC2 gene; six of these pairings together form a functioning enzyme. The alpha subunit also includes a region for binding to the B vitamin biotin, which is required for the enzyme's function.The 3-MCC enzyme is found in mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers inside cells. This enzyme plays a critical role in breaking down proteins obtained from the diet. Specifically, it is responsible for the fourth step in the breakdown of leucine, an amino acid that is a building block of many proteins. This step converts a molecule called 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA to a molecule called 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA. Additional chemical reactions convert 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA into molecules that are later used for energy.","3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency At least 30 mutations in the MCCC1 gene have been identified in people with 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency (also known as 3-MCC deficiency). Most of these mutations change single amino acids in 3-MCC, but a few mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the enzyme. Mutations in the MCCC1 gene severely reduce or eliminate the activity of 3-MCC. As a result, leucine cannot be broken down properly, and byproducts of leucine processing build up to toxic levels in the body. These toxic substances can damage the brain, causing the characteristic signs and symptoms of 3-MCC deficiency. "
809,MCCC2 ,methylcrotonoyl-CoA carboxylase 2,"The MCCC2 gene provides instructions for making one part (the beta subunit) of an enzyme called 3-methylcrotonoyl-CoA carboxylase or 3-MCC. Beta subunits join with larger alpha subunits made from the MCCC1 gene; six of these pairings together form a functioning enzyme.The 3-MCC enzyme is found in mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers inside cells. This enzyme plays a critical role in breaking down proteins obtained from the diet. Specifically, it is responsible for the fourth step in the breakdown of leucine, an amino acid that is a building block of many proteins. This step converts a molecule called 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA to a molecule called 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA. Additional chemical reactions convert 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA into molecules that are later used for energy.","3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency More than 40 mutations in the MCCC2 gene have been identified in people with 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency (also known as 3-MCC deficiency). Most of these mutations change single amino acids in 3-MCC, which severely reduces the activity of the enzyme. Other mutations prevent the production of any functional enzyme. As a result, leucine cannot be broken down properly, and byproducts of leucine processing build up to toxic levels in the body. These toxic substances can damage the brain, causing the characteristic signs and symptoms of 3-MCC deficiency. "
810,MCEE ,methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase,"The MCEE gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called methylmalonyl CoA epimerase, which converts one form of the molecule methylmalonyl CoA to another. Specifically, the enzyme converts D-methylmalonyl CoA to L-methylmalonyl CoA. This conversion takes place within the pathway that converts the molecule propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. This pathway is important in the breakdown of certain protein building blocks (amino acids), specific fats (lipids), and cholesterol.","Methylmalonic acidemia At least three mutations in the MCEE gene have been found to cause methylmalonic acidemia, a condition characterized by feeding difficulties, developmental delay, and long-term health problems. These mutations are thought to result in the production of a methylmalonyl CoA epimerase enzyme with little or no function. People with methylmalonic acidemia caused by mutations in the MCEE gene typically have milder signs and symptoms than people with the condition caused by mutations in other genes. The features may be milder because there is an alternate pathway for the conversion of propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA that does not involve methylmalonyl CoA epimerase, so some succinyl-Co is produced even when there are mutations in the MCEE gene. This alternate pathway cannot compensate for the breakdown of certain molecules that occurs in the regular pathway, so people with MCEE gene mutations still have a buildup of the byproducts of some amino acids and certain fats. As a result, these toxic compounds build up in the body's organs and tissues, causing the signs and symptoms of methylmalonic acidemia. "
811,MCM6 ,minichromosome maintenance complex component 6,"The MCM6 gene provides instructions for making part of the MCM complex, a group of proteins that functions as a helicase. Helicases attach to particular regions of DNA and temporarily unwind the two spiral strands of these molecules. When a cell prepares to divide to form two cells, helicases unwind the DNA so that it can be copied. The DNA that makes up the chromosomes is duplicated (replicated) so that each new cell will get a complete set of chromosomes. Helicases are also involved in the production of RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA.","Lactose intolerance A specific DNA sequence within the MCM6 gene called a regulatory element helps control the activity (expression) of a nearby gene called LCT. The LCT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called lactase. This enzyme helps to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. Lactose intolerance in adulthood is caused by gradually decreasing expression of the LCT gene after infancy, which occurs in most humans.At least four variations have been identified in the regulatory element that modulates LCT gene expression. These variations change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the regulatory element. Each of the variations results in sustained lactase production in the small intestine and the ability to digest lactose throughout life. People without these changes have a reduced ability to digest lactose as they get older, resulting in the signs and symptoms of lactose intolerance. "
812,MCOLN1 ,mucolipin 1,"The MCOLN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called mucolipin-1. This protein is located in the membranes of lysosomes and endosomes, compartments within the cell that digest and recycle materials. While its function is not completely understood, mucolipin-1 plays a role in the transport (trafficking) of fats (lipids) and proteins between lysosomes and endosomes.Mucolipin-1 acts as a channel, allowing positively charged atoms (cations) to cross the membranes of lysosomes and endosomes. It remains unclear which cations are allowed to flow through this channel. Mucolipin-1 appears to be important for the development and maintenance of the brain and light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). In addition, this protein is likely critical for normal functioning of the cells in the stomach that produce digestive acids.","Mucolipidosis type IV At least 22 mutations in the MCOLN1 gene have been found to cause mucolipidosis type IV. Most of these mutations result in the production of a nonfunctional protein or prevent any protein from being produced. Two mutations in the MCOLN1 gene account for almost all cases of mucolipidosis type IV in people with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. The most common mutation, written as 406-2A>G, changes a single DNA building block (nucleotide) in a region of the gene known as intron 3. This mutation, which is called a splice-site mutation, introduces a premature stop signal in the instructions for making mucolipin-1. The other mutation, written as 511_6943del, deletes a large amount of DNA near the beginning of the MCOLN1 gene. Both of these mutations result in the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein.A lack of functional mucolipin-1 impairs transport of lipids and proteins, causing these substances to build up inside lysosomes. It remains unclear how mutations in the MCOLN1 gene lead to delayed development of mental and motor skills (psychomotor delay), progressive vision loss, and impaired secretion of stomach acid (achlorhydia) in people with mucolipidosis type IV. "
813,MECP2 ,methyl-CpG binding protein 2,"The MECP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called MeCP2. This protein helps regulate gene activity (expression) by modifying chromatin, the complex of DNA and protein that packages DNA into chromosomes. The MeCP2 protein is present in cells throughout the body, although it is particularly abundant in brain cells.In the brain, the MeCP2 protein is important for the function of several types of cells, including nerve cells (neurons). The protein likely plays a role in maintaining connections (synapses) between neurons, where cell-to-cell communication occurs. Many of the genes that are known to be regulated by the MeCP2 protein play a role in normal brain function, particularly the maintenance of synapses.Researchers believe that the MeCP2 protein may also be involved in processing molecules called messenger RNA (mRNA), which serve as genetic blueprints for making proteins. By cutting and rearranging mRNA molecules in different ways, the MeCP2 protein controls the production of different versions of certain proteins. This process is known as alternative splicing. In the brain, the alternative splicing of proteins is critical for normal communication between neurons and may also be necessary for the function of other types of brain cells.","MECP2 duplication syndrome An extra copy (duplication) of the MECP2 gene in each cell causes MECP2 duplication syndrome, a condition characterized by intellectual disability, delayed development, and seizures. This condition affects males more often than females. When females are affected, they tend to have milder features. The duplication occurs on the long (q) arm of the X chromosome and includes the MECP2 gene; other genes may also be involved, depending on the size of the duplicated segment. The size of the duplication varies from 100,000 to a few million DNA building blocks (base pairs).Duplication of the MECP2 gene leads to the production of extra MeCP2 protein and an increase in protein function. The resulting changes in gene regulation and protein production in the brain lead to abnormal neuronal function. These neuronal changes disrupt normal brain activity, causing the signs and symptoms of MECP2 duplication syndrome. "
814,MED12 ,mediator complex subunit 12,"The MED12 gene provides instructions for making a protein called mediator complex subunit 12. As its name suggests, this protein forms one part (subunit) of the mediator complex, which is a group of about 25 proteins that work together to regulate gene activity. The mediator complex physically links transcription factors, which are proteins that influence whether genes are turned on or off, with an enzyme called RNA polymerase II. Once transcription factors are attached, this enzyme initiates gene transcription, the process by which information stored in a gene's DNA is used to build proteins.Researchers believe that the MED12 protein is involved in many aspects of early development, including the development of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. The MED12 protein is part of several chemical signaling pathways within cells. These pathways help direct a broad range of cellular activities, such as cell growth, cell movement (migration), and the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation).","FG syndrome At least two mutations in the MED12 gene have been found to cause FG syndrome, which is characterized by intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and physical abnormalities including weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and obstruction of the anal opening (imperforate anus).The mutations that cause FG syndrome each change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the MED12 protein. One mutation replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid tryptophan at protein position 961 (written as Arg961Trp or R961W). The other replaces the amino acid glycine with the amino acid glutamic acid at protein position 958 (written as Gly958Glu or G958E). These mutations alter the structure of the MED12 protein, which likely disrupts its ability to regulate gene activity during development. However, it is unclear how the genetic changes lead to intellectual disability and the other features of FG syndrome. "
815,MED13L ,mediator complex subunit 13 like,"The MED13L gene provides instructions for making a protein that is one piece (subunit) of a group of proteins known as the mediator complex. This complex regulates the activity (transcription) of genes. Transcription is the first step in the process by which information stored in a gene's DNA is used to build proteins.The mediator complex physically links the proteins that can turn genes on, called transcription factors, with the enzyme that carries out transcription, called RNA polymerase II. Once transcription factors are attached to RNA polymerase II, transcription begins.Researchers believe that as part of the mediator complex, the MED13L protein is involved in many aspects of early development, including development of the heart, nerve cells (neurons) in the brain, and structures in the face. The mediator complex plays a role in several chemical signaling pathways within cells. These pathways help direct a broad range of cellular activities, such as cell growth, cell movement (migration), and the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation).","MED13L syndrome More than 50 mutations in the MED13L gene have been found to cause MED13L syndrome. This condition is characterized by moderate to severe developmental delay and intellectual disability and minor differences in facial features. Additionally, some people with MED13L syndrome have recurrent seizures (epilepsy) or heart abnormalities that are present from birth (congenital heart defects).Some MED13L gene mutations insert or delete regions of DNA within the MED13L gene. These genetic changes lead to a reduction in the total amount of MED13L protein in cells. Other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the MED13L protein. It is thought that the altered protein interferes with the function of the normal protein produced from the non-mutated copy of the MED13L gene (such mutations are described as ""dominant-negative""). Because dominant negative mutations impair the function of proteins made from both the altered copy of the MED13L gene and the normal copy, individuals with dominant negative mutations tend to have more severe signs than people with mutations that affect protein production from just the altered copy of the gene. While it is likely that mutations in the MED13L gene impair the control of gene activity by the mediator complex, it is unclear how these changes lead to the particular cognitive and physical features of the disorder. "
816,MEFV ,"MEFV, pyrin innate immunity regulator","The MEFV gene provides instructions for making a protein called pyrin (also known as marenostrin). Although pyrin's function is not fully understood, it likely assists in keeping the inflammation process under control. Inflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair. When this has been accomplished, the body stops the inflammatory response to prevent damage to its own cells and tissues.Pyrin is produced in certain white blood cells (neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes) that play a role in inflammation and in fighting infection. Pyrin may direct the migration of white blood cells to sites of inflammation and stop or slow the inflammatory response when it is no longer needed. Pyrin also interacts with other molecules involved in fighting infection and in the inflammatory response. Research indicates that pyrin helps regulate inflammation by interacting with the cytoskeleton, the structural framework that helps to define the shape, size, and movement of a cell.","Familial Mediterranean fever More than 80 MEFV gene mutations that cause familial Mediterranean fever have been identified. A few mutations delete small amounts of DNA from the MEFV gene, which can lead to an abnormally small, nonfunctional protein. Most MEFV gene mutations, however, change one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make pyrin. The most common mutation replaces the amino acid methionine with the amino acid valine at protein position 694 (written as Met694Val or M694V). Among people with familial Mediterranean fever, this particular mutation is also associated with an increased risk of developing amyloidosis, a complication in which abnormal protein deposits can lead to kidney failure. Some evidence suggests that variations in another gene, called SAA1, can further modify the risk of developing amyloidosis among people with the M694V mutation.MEFV gene mutations lead to reduced amounts of pyrin or a malformed pyrin protein that cannot function properly. As a result, pyrin cannot perform its presumed role in controlling inflammation, leading to an inappropriate or prolonged inflammatory response. Fever and inflammation in the abdomen, chest, joints, or skin are signs of familial Mediterranean fever. "
817,MEGF8 ,multiple EGF like domains 8,"The MEGF8 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unclear. Based on its structure, the Megf8 protein may be involved in cell processes such as attaching cells to one another (cell adhesion) and helping proteins interact with each other. Researchers also suspect that the Megf8 protein plays a role in the normal shaping (patterning) of many parts of the body during embryonic development.","Carpenter syndrome At least six mutations in the MEGF8 gene have been found to cause Carpenter syndrome, a condition characterized by irregular skull formation, finger and toe abnormalities, and many other features. These mutations reduce or eliminate the function of the Megf8 protein. Researchers suspect that the amount of protein function that is retained may contribute to the variability in signs and symptoms. It is unclear how MEGF8 gene mutations cause Carpenter syndrome. The mutations likely interfere with normal patterning of many parts of the body, which contributes to the features of this disorder. "
818,MEN1 ,menin 1,"The MEN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called menin. This protein acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it keeps cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way. Although the exact function of menin is unclear, it is likely involved in several important cell functions. For example, it may play a role in copying and repairing DNA and regulating the controlled self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). The menin protein is present in the nucleus of many different types of cells and appears to be active in all stages of development.Menin interacts with many other proteins, including several transcription factors. Transcription factors bind to specific areas of DNA and help control whether particular genes are turned on or off. Some of these genes likely play a role in cell growth and division. Researchers are working to identify the proteins that interact with menin and determine its specific role as a tumor suppressor.","Familial isolated hyperparathyroidism Mutations in the MEN1 gene have been found in some cases of familial isolated hyperparathyroidism, a condition characterized by overactivity of the parathyroid glands (primary hyperparathyroidism). These glands help control the normal balance of calcium in the blood. This balance is disrupted in familial isolated hyperparathyroidism, which can lead to high blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia), kidney stones, thinning of bones, nausea and vomiting, high blood pressure (hypertension), weakness, and fatigue. Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common sign of another condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (described below); however, familial isolated hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed in people with hyperparathyroidism but not the other features of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.Many of the mutations in the MEN1 gene that are associated with familial isolated hyperparathyroidism change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the menin protein. It is thought that these amino acid changes impair menin's ability to interact with other proteins. Without normal menin function, cells likely divide too frequently, leading to the formation of tumors involving the parathyroid glands. Researchers speculate that the mutations that cause familial isolated hyperparathyroidism have a milder effect on the function of menin than the mutations that cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Occasionally, individuals with familial isolated hyperparathyroidism later develop features of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, although most never do. Familial isolated hyperparathyroidism caused by MEN1 gene mutations may be an early or mild form of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. "
819,MEOX1 ,mesenchyme homeobox 1,"The MEOX1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called homeobox protein MOX-1, which is a member of the homeobox protein family. Homeobox proteins direct the formation of body structures during early embryonic development. Homeobox protein MOX-1 regulates the process that begins separating vertebrae from one another, a process called somite segmentation. The protein functions as a transcription factor, which means it attaches to DNA and controls the activity (expression) of other genes. Homeobox protein MOX-1 likely controls the expression of genes that regulate somite segmentation. Homeobox protein MOX-1 also ensures that the developing vertebral bone is maintained in its correct position for proper formation. Additionally, the homeobox protein MOX-1 plays a role in the formation of the joints that connect the base of the skull and the top of spine (cranio-cervical joints).","Klippel-Feil syndrome At least three mutations in the MEOX1 gene have been found to cause Klippel-Feil syndrome. This condition is characterized by the abnormal joining (fusion) of two or more spinal bones in the neck (cervical vertebrae) and a variety of other features affecting many parts of the body. The MEOX1 gene mutations result in a lack of functional homeobox protein MOX-1. While the effect of the loss of this protein on vertebral development is unclear, it is likely that absence of this protein leads to unregulated somite segmentation and incorrect vertebral positioning. As a result, the cervical vertebrae do not separate during development but instead are fused together. It is unclear why this condition affects the cervical vertebrae more severely than other bones. "
820,MESP2 ,mesoderm posterior bHLH transcription factor 2,"The MESP2 gene provides instructions for making a transcription factor, which is a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. The MESP2 protein controls the activity of genes in the Notch pathway, an important pathway in embryonic development. The Notch pathway plays a critical role in the development of the bones of the spine (vertebrae). Specifically, the MESP2 protein and the Notch pathway are involved in separating future vertebrae from one another during early development, in a complex process called somite segmentation. Although the exact mechanism of somite segmentation is unclear, it appears to require the activity of several proteins in the Notch pathway, including the NOTCH1 protein and the MESP2 protein, to be turned on and off (oscillate) in a specific pattern.The MESP2 protein regulates Notch activity by turning on (activating) genes in the Notch pathway, which ultimately block (repress) the activity of the NOTCH1 protein. Additionally, through unknown mechanisms, the MESP2 protein seems to mark the boundary separating future vertebrae from one another.",Spondylocostal dysostosis Genetics Home Reference provides information about spondylocostal dysostosis. 
821,MFN2 ,mitofusin 2,"The MFN2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called mitofusin 2. This protein helps determine the shape and structure (morphology) of mitochondria, the energy-producing centers within cells. Mitofusin 2 is made in many types of cells and tissues, including muscles, the spinal cord, and the nerves that connect the brain and spinal cord to muscles and to sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and sound (peripheral nerves).Within cells, mitofusin 2 is found in the outer membrane that surrounds mitochondria. Mitochondria are dynamic structures that undergo changes in morphology through processes called fission (splitting into smaller pieces) and fusion (combining pieces). These changes in morphology are necessary for mitochondria to function properly. Mitofusin 2 helps to regulate the morphology of mitochondria by controlling the fusion process.","Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Researchers have identified more than 100 MFN2 gene mutations that cause a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease known as type 2A. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease damages the peripheral nerves, which can result in loss of sensation and wasting (atrophy) of muscles in the feet, legs, and hands.Almost all of the MFN2 gene mutations that cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in mitofusin 2. These changes alter a critical region in mitofusin 2, and the protein cannot function properly. A few mutations create a premature stop signal in the instructions for making mitofusin 2. As a result, no protein is produced, or an abnormally small protein is made.Several MFN2 gene mutations cause a variant of type 2A Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease that is characterized by particularly severe symptoms that begin before age 10 and include impaired vision. (This variant is also called hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy VI.) Vision loss is caused by the breakdown of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain (optic atrophy).It is unclear how MFN2 gene mutations lead to the nerve problems characteristic of type 2A Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Researchers suggest that mitochondria cannot fuse properly or move normally within the cell without functional mitofusin 2, which may disrupt the cell's energy supply. Nerve cells may be particularly sensitive to an interrupted supply of energy. "
822,MFSD8 ,major facilitator superfamily domain containing 8,"The MFSD8 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. The MFSD8 protein is embedded in the membrane of cell compartments called lysosomes, which digest and recycle different types of molecules. It is one of a large group of related proteins called the major facilitator superfamily of secondary active transporter proteins. Proteins in this family move certain molecules within a cell or in and out of cells. While it is likely that the MFSD8 protein transports molecules across the lysosomal membrane, the specific molecules it moves have not been identified.","CLN7 disease At least 30 mutations in the MFSD8 gene have been found to cause CLN7 disease. This condition typically starts in early childhood with the loss of previously acquired skills (developmental regression), recurrent seizures (epilepsy), muscle twitches (myoclonus), difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), speech impairment, and vision loss. Mental functioning and motor skills (such as sitting and walking) decline with age. Individuals with CLN7 disease typically do not survive past their teens.MFSD8 gene mutations that cause CLN7 disease likely lead to the production of a protein with altered structure or function. One MFSD8 gene mutation is responsible for almost all cases of CLN7 disease in the Roma population of the Czech Republic. This mutation replaces the protein building block (amino acid) threonine with the amino acid lysine at position 294 in the MFSD8 protein (written as T294K). A variety of other mutations cause the condition in other populations.It is unclear how an altered MFSD8 protein leads to the severe neurological features of CLN7 disease. CLN7 disease is characterized by the accumulation of proteins and other substances in lysosomes. These accumulations occur in cells throughout the body; however, nerve cells seem to be particularly vulnerable to their effects. These accumulations can cause cell damage leading to cell death. Individuals with CLN7 disease have gradual nerve cell loss in certain parts of the brain, which likely leads to the signs and symptoms of this condition. "
823,MID1 ,midline 1,"The MID1 gene is part of a group of genes called the tripartite motif (TRIM) family. Proteins produced from this large family of genes are involved in many cellular activities. Primarily, TRIM proteins play a role in the cell machinery that recycles unwanted proteins by tagging them with a protein called ubiquitin. Ubiquitin serves as a signal to move these unwanted proteins into specialized structures known as proteasomes, where the proteins are recycled.The MID1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called midline-1. This protein attaches (binds) to microtubules, which are rigid, hollow fibers that make up the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton). Microtubules help cells maintain their shape, assist in the process of cell division, and are essential for the movement of cells (cell migration). Midline-1 is responsible for recycling certain proteins, including protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), integrin alpha-4 (ITGA4), and serine/threonine-protein kinase 36 (STK36). The recycling of these three proteins so they can be reused instead of broken down is essential because they are necessary for normal cellular functioning.","Opitz G/BBB syndrome About 90 mutations in the MID1 gene have been found to cause Opitz G/BBB syndrome. This condition causes several abnormalities along the midline of the body, including widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), difficulty breathing or swallowing, brain malformations, distinct facial features, and genital abnormalities in males. The majority of the MID1 gene mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the midline-1 protein. Other mutations delete multiple amino acids and can result in the production of an abnormally short protein. These mutations lead to a decrease in midline-1 function, which prevents protein recycling. As a result, certain proteins are not recycled, and they accumulate in cells. This buildup impairs microtubule function, resulting in problems with cell division and migration. Researchers speculate that the altered midline-1 protein affects how the cells divide and migrate along the midline of the body during development, resulting in the features of Opitz G/BBB syndrome. "
824,MIR17HG ,miR-17-92a-1 cluster host gene,"The MIR17HG gene provides instructions for making the miR-17~92 microRNA (miRNA) cluster. MiRNAs are short pieces of RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. These molecules control gene expression by blocking protein production. The miR-17~92 cluster includes six miRNAs: miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-19b-1, miR-20a, and miR-92a-1. MiRNAs in this cluster control the expression of hundreds of genes. These miRNAs help regulate signaling pathways that direct several cellular processes involved in growth and development, including cell growth and division (proliferation), cell maturation (differentiation), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). Studies suggest that the miR-17~92 cluster is necessary for normal development of the skeleton, heart, kidneys, lungs, and nervous system.The MIR17HG gene belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous.","Feingold syndrome Genetic changes that reduce the amount of the MIR17HG gene cause Feingold syndrome type 2. This developmental disorder is characterized by abnormalities of the fingers and toes, particularly shortening of the second and fifth fingers (brachymesophalangy). Other common features include an unusually small head size (microcephaly) and learning disabilities. The mutations involved in this condition, known as 13q31.3 microdeletions, remove (delete) a small region of chromosome 13 that includes the MIR17HG gene and sometimes part or all of other nearby genes. Loss of the MIR17HG gene is thought to underlie the characteristic features of the disorder, although loss of other genes may play a role in some cases.Deletion of one copy of the MIR17HG gene reduces the amount of miR-17~92 cluster miRNAs available to control the activity of specific genes during development before birth. While it is likely that the resulting disruption of signaling pathways leads to the problems with growth and development characteristic of Feingold syndrome type 2, it remains unclear exactly how a shortage of miR-17~92 cluster miRNAs causes the specific features of the condition. "
825,MIR145 ,microRNA 145,"The MIR145 gene provides instructions for making microRNA-145 (miR-145). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short lengths of RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. These molecules control gene expression by blocking the process of protein production. MiR-145 is abundant in immature blood cells and controls the expression of hundreds of genes. This microRNA is thought to be involved in normal blood cell development. In particular, miR-145 appears to play a role in the growth and division of blood cells called megakaryocytes, which produce platelets, the cells involved in blood clotting.","5q minus syndrome The MIR145 gene is involved in a condition called 5q minus (5q-) syndrome. This condition is a type of bone marrow disorder called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with 5q- syndrome often have a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) and abnormalities in megakaryocytes. Affected individuals also have an increased risk of developing a fast-growing blood cancer known as acute myeloid leukemia (AML).5q- syndrome is caused by deletion of a region of DNA from the long (q) arm of chromosome 5. This deletion occurs in immature blood cells during a person's lifetime and affects one copy of chromosome 5 in each cell. Most people with 5q- syndrome are missing a sequence of about 1.5 million DNA building blocks (base pairs), also written as 1.5 megabases (Mb). This deleted region contains 40 genes, including MIR145. Loss of one copy of the MIR145 gene reduces the amount of the microRNA miR-145 in cells. As a result, levels of proteins whose production is normally blocked by miR-145 are elevated, which leads to the abnormal development of megakaryocytes that occurs in 5q- syndrome. Research suggests that the other features of the condition are associated with other genes in the deleted segment of DNA. "
826,MIR146A ,microRNA 146a,"The MIR146A gene provides instructions for making microRNA-146a (miR-146a). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short lengths of RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. These molecules control gene expression by blocking the process of protein production. MiR-146a is abundant in immature blood cells and controls the expression of hundreds of genes. This microRNA is thought to be involved in normal blood cell development. In particular, miR-146a appears to play a role in the growth and division of blood cells called megakaryocytes, which produce platelets, the cells involved in blood clotting.","5q minus syndrome The MIR146A gene is involved in a condition called 5q minus (5q-) syndrome. This condition is a type of bone marrow disorder called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with 5q- syndrome often have a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) and abnormalities in megakaryocytes.

Most people with 5q- syndrome are missing a sequence of about 1.5 million DNA building blocks (base pairs), also written as 1.5 megabases (Mb). This deleted region contains 40 genes, often including MIR146A. Loss of one copy of the MIR146A gene reduces the amount of the microRNA miR-146a in cells. As a result, levels of proteins whose production is normally blocked by miR-146a are elevated, which leads to the abnormal development of megakaryocytes that occurs in 5q- syndrome. Research suggests that the other features of the condition are associated with other genes in the deleted segment of DNA. "
827,MITF ,melanocyte inducing transcription factor,"The MITF gene provides instructions for making a protein called melanocyte inducing transcription factor. This protein plays a role in the development, survival, and function of certain types of cells. To carry out this role, the protein attaches to specific areas of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. On the basis of this action, the protein is called a transcription factor.Melanocyte inducing transcription factor helps control the development and function of pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. Within these cells, this protein controls production of the pigment melanin, which contributes to hair, eye, and skin color. Melanocytes are also found in the inner ear and play an important role in hearing. Additionally, melanocyte inducing transcription factor regulates the development of specialized cells in the eye called retinal pigment epithelial cells. These cells nourish the retina, the part of the eye that detects light and color. Some research indicates that melanocyte inducing transcription factor also regulates the development of cells that break down and remove bone (osteoclasts) and cells that play a role in allergic reactions (mast cells).The structure of melanocyte inducing transcription factor includes three critically important regions. Two of the regions, called the helix-loop-helix motif and the leucine-zipper motif, are critical for protein interactions. These motifs allow molecules of melanocyte inducing transcription factor to interact with each other or with other proteins that have a similar structure, creating a two-protein unit (dimer) that functions as a transcription factor. The other region, known as the basic motif, binds to specific areas of DNA, allowing the dimer to control gene activity.","Tietz syndrome At least two MITF gene mutations have been identified in people with Tietz syndrome, which is characterized by profound hearing loss from birth, fair skin, and light-colored hair. Researchers suggest that Tietz syndrome may be a severe form of Waardenburg syndrome (described below).The MITF gene mutations that cause Tietz syndrome either delete or change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the basic motif region of the melanocyte inducing transcription factor structure. Dimers incorporating the abnormal melanocyte inducing transcription factor cannot be transported into the cell nucleus to bind with DNA. As a result, most of the dimers are unavailable to bind to DNA, which affects the development of melanocytes and the production of melanin. The resulting reduction or absence of melanocytes in the inner ear leads to hearing loss. Decreased melanin production (hypopigmentation) accounts for the light skin and hair color that are characteristic of Tietz syndrome. "
828,MKKS ,McKusick-Kaufman syndrome,"The MKKS gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in the formation of the limbs, heart, and reproductive system. The structure of this protein suggests that it may act as a chaperonin, which is a protein that helps fold other proteins. Proteins must be folded into the correct 3-dimensional shape to perform their usual functions in the body. Abnormally folded proteins can also interfere with the functions of normal proteins.Although the structure of the MKKS protein is similar to that of a chaperonin, some studies have suggested that protein folding may not be this protein's primary function. Within cells, the MKKS protein is associated with structures called centrosomes. Centrosomes play a role in cell division and the assembly of microtubules, which are proteins that transport materials in cells and help the cell maintain its shape. Researchers speculate that the MKKS protein may be involved in transporting other proteins within the cell.","McKusick-Kaufman syndrome Two mutations in the MKKS gene have been identified in people with McKusick-Kaufman syndrome in the Old Order Amish population. Each of these mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the MKKS protein. One mutation replaces the amino acid histidine with the amino acid tyrosine at protein position 84 (written as His84Tyr or H84Y). The other mutation replaces the amino acid alanine with the amino acid serine at protein position 242 (written as Ala242Ser or A242S). Affected Amish people have these two mutations in both copies of the MKKS gene.The mutations that underlie McKusick-Kaufman syndrome alter the structure of the MKKS protein. Although the altered protein disrupts the development of several parts of the body before birth, it is unclear how MKKS mutations lead to the specific features of this disorder.The signs and symptoms of McKusick-Kaufman syndrome overlap significantly with those of another condition called Bardet-Biedl syndrome, which can make the two conditions difficult to tell apart in infancy and early childhood. Although both syndromes can be caused by changes in the MKKS gene, it remains unclear why some mutations cause McKusick-Kaufman syndrome and others cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome. "
829,MKRN3 ,makorin ring finger protein 3,"The MKRN3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called makorin ring finger protein 3 (MKRN3). This protein plays a role in directing the onset of puberty, which describes the changes in the body related to sexual development that normally occur in adolescence. Puberty begins when a gland in the brain called the hypothalamus is stimulated to release bursts of a hormone called gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). This hormone triggers the release of other hormones that direct sexual development. Research suggests that the MKRN3 protein blocks (inhibits) the release of GnRH from the hypothalamus, thus holding off the onset of puberty.The exact function of the MKRN3 protein is unknown. Based on its structure, the protein is thought to play a role in the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unwanted proteins, called the ubiquitin-proteasome system, by helping attach a molecule called ubiquitin to unwanted proteins. Ubiquitin acts as a signal to the ubiquitin-proteasome system to break the protein down. Researchers speculate that MKRN3 adds ubiquitin to proteins that would otherwise stimulate GnRH release. The breakdown of such proteins ensures that puberty does not begin until the right time.For most genes, both copies of the gene (one copy inherited from each parent) are active in all cells. However, the activity of the MKRN3 gene depends on which parent it was inherited from. Only the copy inherited from a person's father is active; the copy inherited from the mother is not active. This sort of parent-specific difference in gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting.","Central precocious puberty More than 20 MKRN3 gene mutations have been found to cause central precocious puberty. Individuals with this condition develop the signs of puberty earlier than normal, before age 8 in girls and before age 9 in boys. These signs include development of breasts and the start of a menstrual period in girls, enlargement of the testes and penis in boys, and development of pubic hair and a growth spurt in both girls and boys.The MKRN3 gene mutations involved in central precocious puberty are thought to lead to production of a nonfunctional MKRN3 protein from one copy of the gene. Because the other copy of the gene is inactive, affected individuals likely produce no functional MKRN3 protein. Although the mechanism is unclear, researchers speculate that without the MKRN3 protein to inhibit GnRH release, the hypothalamus releases bursts of the hormone, which stimulates the onset of puberty earlier than normal.Because only the copy of the MKRN3 gene from the father is active, the condition can only be inherited from a person's father. "
830,MLC1 ,megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts 1,"The MLC1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found primarily in the brain but also in the spleen and white blood cells (leukocytes). Within the brain, the MLC1 protein is found in astroglial cells, which are a specialized form of brain cells called glial cells. Glial cells protect and maintain other nerve cells (neurons). The MLC1 protein functions at junctions that connect neighboring astroglial cells. The role of the MLC1 protein at the cell junction is unknown, but research suggests that it may control the flow of fluids into cells or the strength of cells' attachment to one another (cell adhesion). Studies indicate that the MLC1 protein may be involved in transporting molecules across the blood-brain barrier and the brain-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. These barriers protect the brain's delicate nerve tissue by allowing only certain substances to pass into the brain.","Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts More than 80 mutations in the MLC1 gene have been found to cause megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts type 1; this type accounts for 75 percent of all cases. This condition affects brain development and function, resulting in problems with movement and recurrent seizures. Most of the MLC1 gene mutations that cause this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the MLC1 protein. These changes alter the structure of the MLC1 protein or prevent the cell from producing any protein. It is unknown how a lack of MLC1 protein at astroglial cell junctions impairs brain development and function, causing the signs and symptoms of megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts type 1. "
831,MLH1 ,mutL homolog 1,"The MLH1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an essential role in DNA repair. This protein helps fix errors that are made when DNA is copied (DNA replication) in preparation for cell division. The MLH1 protein joins with another protein called PMS2 (produced from the PMS2 gene), to form a protein complex. This complex coordinates the activities of other proteins that repair errors made during DNA replication. The repairs are made by removing a section of DNA that contains errors and replacing the section with a corrected DNA sequence. The MLH1 gene is a member of a set of genes known as the mismatch repair (MMR) genes.","Lynch syndrome About 50 percent of all cases of Lynch syndrome with an identified gene mutation are associated with inherited mutations in the MLH1 gene. Several hundred MLH1 gene mutations have been found in people with this condition. Lynch syndrome increases the risk of many types of cancer, particularly cancers of the colon (large intestine) and rectum, which are collectively referred to as colorectal cancer. People with Lynch syndrome also have an increased risk of cancers of the endometrium (lining of the uterus), ovaries, stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder duct, upper urinary tract, and brain.MLH1 gene mutations involved in this condition prevent the production of the MLH1 protein or lead to an altered version of this protein that does not function properly. When the MLH1 protein is absent or nonfunctional, the number of DNA errors that are left unrepaired during cell division increases substantially. The errors accumulate as the cells continue to divide, which may cause the cells to function abnormally, increasing the risk of tumor formation in the colon or another part of the body.Some mutations in the MLH1 gene cause a variant of Lynch syndrome called Turcot syndrome. In addition to colorectal cancer, people with Turcot syndrome tend to develop a particular type of brain tumor called a glioblastoma.Another variant of Lynch syndrome, called Muir-Torre syndrome, can also be caused by mutations in the MLH1 gene. In addition to colorectal cancer, people with this condition have an increased risk of developing several uncommon skin tumors. These rare skin tumors include sebaceous adenomas and carcinomas, which occur in glands that produce an oily substance called sebum (sebaceous glands). Multiple rapidly growing tumors called keratoacanthomas may also occur, usually on sun-exposed areas of skin. "
832,MLPH ,melanophilin,"The MLPH gene provides instructions for making a protein called melanophilin. This protein is found in pigment-producing cells called melanocytes, where it helps transport structures called melanosomes. These structures produce a pigment called melanin, which is the substance that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color (pigmentation). Melanophilin interacts with proteins produced from the MYO5A and RAB27A genes to form a complex that transports melanosomes to the outer edges of melanocytes. From there, the melanosomes are transferred to other types of cells, where they provide the pigment needed for normal hair, skin, and eye coloring.","Griscelli syndrome At least one mutation in the MLPH gene has been found to cause Griscelli syndrome. This genetic change causes a form of the condition designated type 3, which is characterized by unusually light (hypopigmented) skin and silvery-gray hair. Unlike the other forms of Griscelli syndrome, type 3 does not involve abnormalities of the brain or immune system.The known MLPH gene mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the melanophilin protein. Specifically, it replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid tryptophan at protein position 35 (written as Arg35Trp or R35W). This mutation reduces the amount of melanophilin produced; the small amount of protein that is produced is unable to form a complex with the proteins made from the MYO5A and RAB27A genes. Without this complex, melanosomes cannot be transported to the edges of melanocytes. Instead, they clump near the center of melanocytes, trapping melanin within these cells and preventing normal pigmentation of skin and hair. "
833,MLYCD ,malonyl-CoA decarboxylase,"The MLYCD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called malonyl-CoA decarboxylase. This enzyme helps regulate the formation and breakdown of a group of fats called fatty acids. Many tissues, including heart (cardiac) muscle, use fatty acids as a major source of energy. The body also uses fatty acids to build cell membranes, produce hormones, and carry out many other important processes.Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase is responsible for the chemical reaction that converts a molecule called malonyl-CoA to a molecule called acetyl-CoA. This reaction is an important step in the breakdown of fatty acids. Acetyl-CoA is then used to make new fatty acids and can also be used to produce energy.Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase is most active in cardiac muscle and in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). It is also found in other organs and tissues, including the brain, small intestine, liver, kidney, and pancreas. This enzyme probably functions in several parts of the cell, including mitochondria, which are cells' energy-producing centers, and peroxisomes, which are small sacs that process fatty acids and other molecules. Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase also functions in the fluid that surrounds these cell structures (the cytoplasm).","Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency More than 20 mutations in the MLYCD gene have been identified in people with malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency. Some of these mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase or prevent the gene from producing any of this enzyme. Other mutations change the structure of the enzyme so it cannot be delivered to the parts of the cell where it is needed (such as mitochondria and peroxisomes).A lack of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase disrupts the normal balance of fatty acid formation and breakdown in the body. As a result, fatty acids cannot be converted to energy, which leads to characteristic features of this disorder including low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and a heart condition called cardiomyopathy. Byproducts of fatty acid processing build up in tissues, which also contributes to the signs and symptoms of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency. "
834,MMAA ,metabolism of cobalamin associated A,"The MMAA gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the formation of a compound called adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl). AdoCbl, which is derived from vitamin B12 (also called cobalamin), is necessary for the normal function of an enzyme known as methylmalonyl CoA mutase. This enzyme helps break down certain proteins, fats (lipids), and cholesterol.Research indicates that the MMAA protein may play a role in one of the last steps in AdoCbl formation, the transport of vitamin B12 into mitochondria (specialized structures inside cells that serve as energy-producing centers). Additional chemical reactions then convert vitamin B12 into AdoCbl. Other studies suggest that the MMAA protein may help stabilize methylmalonyl CoA mutase and protect the enzyme from being turned off (inactivated).","Methylmalonic acidemia More than 25 mutations in the MMAA gene have been found to cause methylmalonic acidemia, a condition characterized by feeding difficulties, developmental delay, and long term health problems. Some of these mutations add, delete, or duplicate a small amount of genetic material in the gene. Other mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) used to make the MMAA protein. These mutations can lead to the production of an unstable MMAA protein or an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the protein. It is unclear how the abnormal MMAA protein leads to the serious medical problems associated with methylmalonic acidemia. Studies suggest that without the activity of this protein, AdoCbl may not be made properly. A lack of AdoCbl impairs the function of methylmalonyl CoA mutase, which results in the incomplete break down of certain proteins and lipids. This defect allows toxic compounds to build up in the body's organs and tissues. Research suggests that a lack of AdoCbl leading to impaired methylmalonyl CoA mutase function causes the signs and symptoms of methylmalonic acidemia. "
835,MMAB ,metabolism of cobalamin associated B,"The MMAB gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is involved in the formation of a compound called adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl). AdoCbl, which is derived from vitamin B12 (also known as cobalamin), is necessary for the normal function of another enzyme known as methylmalonyl CoA mutase. This enzyme helps break down certain proteins, fats (lipids), and cholesterol.The MMAB enzyme is active in mitochondria, which are specialized structures inside cells that serve as energy-producing centers. Once vitamin B12 has been transported into mitochondria, the MMAB enzyme converts a form of the vitamin called cob(I)alamin to AdoCbl. Studies suggest that this enzyme may also deliver AdoCbl to methylmalonyl CoA mutase.","Methylmalonic acidemia At least 25 mutations in the MMAB gene have been found to cause methylmalonic acidemia, a condition characterized by feeding difficulties, developmental delay, and long-term health problems. Some of these genetic changes delete or duplicate a small amount of genetic material in the MMAB gene. Other mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) used to make the MMAB enzyme. Researchers believe that nearly all of these mutations lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of the enzyme. As a result, AdoCbl cannot be made properly. A lack of AdoCbl impairs the function of methylmalonyl CoA mutase, which results in the incomplete breakdown of certain proteins and lipids. This defect allows toxic compounds to build up in the body's organs and tissues, causing the signs and symptoms of methylmalonic acidemia. "
836,MMACHC ,metabolism of cobalamin associated C,"The MMACHC gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps convert vitamin B12 (also called cobalamin) into one of two molecules, adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) or methylcobalamin (MeCbl). AdoCbl is required for the normal function of an enzyme known as methylmalonyl CoA mutase. This enzyme helps break down certain protein building blocks (amino acids), fats (lipids), and cholesterol. AdoCbl is called a cofactor because it helps methylmalonyl CoA mutase carry out its function. MeCbl is also a cofactor, but for an enzyme known as methionine synthase. This enzyme converts the amino acid homocysteine to another amino acid, methionine. The body uses methionine to make proteins and other important compounds.Research indicates that the MMACHC protein plays a role in processing different forms of vitamin B12 so that they can be converted to either of the cofactors, AdoCbl or MeCbl. MMACHC also interacts with another protein called MMADHC (produced from the MMADHC gene). Together these proteins transport the processed vitamin B12 to regions of the cell in which each cofactor is needed: specialized structures that serve as energy-producing centers (the mitochondria), where AdoCbl functions, or the fluid inside the cell (the cytoplasm), where MeCbl functions. Additional chemical reactions then convert vitamin B12 into AdoCbl or MeCbl.","Methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria Dozens of MMACHC gene mutations have been found to cause methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria, cblC type, the most common form of a disorder that causes developmental delay, eye defects, neurological problems, and blood abnormalities. The most common mutation involved in this condition, called 271dupA, inserts an extra DNA building block (nucleotide) at position 271 of the gene. This change alters the protein blueprint, leading to production of an abnormally short protein that is unable to function. Other MMACHC gene mutations also lead to production of a protein with impaired function. A shortage of functional MMACHC protein prevents normal processing and transport of vitamin B12, impairing production of both AdoCbl and MeCbl. Because both of these cofactors are missing, the enzymes that require them (methylmalonyl CoA mutase and methionine synthase) do not function normally. As a result, certain amino acids, lipids, and cholesterol are not broken down and homocysteine cannot be converted to methionine. This dual defect results in a buildup of toxic compounds as well as homocysteine, and a decrease in the production of methionine within the body. This combination of imbalances leads to the signs and symptoms of methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria. "
837,MMADHC ,metabolism of cobalamin associated D,"The MMADHC gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps convert vitamin B12 (also called cobalamin) into one of two molecules, adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) or methylcobalamin (MeCbl). AdoCbl is required for the normal function of an enzyme known as methylmalonyl CoA mutase. This enzyme helps break down certain protein building blocks (amino acids), fats (lipids), and cholesterol. AdoCbl is called a cofactor because it helps methylmalonyl CoA mutase carry out its function. MeCbl is also a cofactor, but for an enzyme known as methionine synthase. This enzyme converts the amino acid homocysteine to another amino acid, methionine. The body uses methionine to make proteins and other important compounds.Research indicates that the MMADHC protein plays a role in one of the last steps in AdoCbl and MeCbl formation. Together with another protein called MMACHC (produced from the MMACHC gene), MMADHC transports vitamin B12 to regions of the cell in which each cofactor is needed: specialized structures that serve as energy-producing centers (the mitochondria), where AdoCbl functions, or the fluid inside the cell (the cytoplasm), where MeCbl functions. Additional chemical reactions then convert vitamin B12 into AdoCbl or MeCbl.","Homocystinuria At least seven mutations in the MMADHC gene cause a condition called homocystinuria, which is characterized by skeletal problems and intellectual disability. The MMADHC gene mutations that cause homocystinuria result in a protein that cannot transport vitamin B12 to the cytoplasm, where MeCbl is produced. The resulting shortage of MeCbl impairs methionine synthase's conversion of homocysteine to methionine. As a result, homocysteine builds up in the bloodstream and methionine is depleted. Some of the excess homocysteine is excreted in urine. Researchers have not determined how altered levels of homocysteine and methionine lead to the health problems associated with homocystinuria. "
838,MMP2 ,matrix metallopeptidase 2,"The MMP2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called matrix metallopeptidase 2. This enzyme is produced in cells throughout the body and becomes part of the extracellular matrix, which is an intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. One of the major known functions of matrix metallopeptidase 2 is to cut (cleave) a protein called type IV collagen. Type IV collagen is a major structural component of basement membranes, which are thin, sheet-like structures that separate and support cells as part of the extracellular matrix.The activity of matrix metallopeptidase 2 appears to be important for a variety of body functions. These include the breakdown of the uterine lining (endometrium) during menstruation, formation and growth of new blood vessels, repair of damaged tissues, and inflammation. Matrix metallopeptidase 2 also plays a role in bone remodeling, which is a normal process in which old bone is broken down and new bone is created to replace it.","Multicentric osteolysis, nodulosis, and arthropathy At least eight mutations in the MMP2 gene have been found to cause multicentric osteolysis, nodulosis, and arthropathy (MONA), a rare inherited bone disease that is characterized by the loss of bone tissue (osteolysis), particularly in the hands and feet, and related joint problems described as arthropathy. Each of the known MMP2 gene mutations eliminates the function of the matrix metallopeptidase 2 enzyme, preventing the normal cleavage of type IV collagen. It is unclear how a loss of enzyme activity leads to the specific features of MONA. Researchers suspect that it somehow disrupts the balance of new bone creation and the breakdown of existing bone during bone remodeling, resulting in a progressive loss of bone tissue. How a shortage of matrix metallopeptidase 2 leads to other features of MONA, such as firm lumps under the skin (subcutaneous nodules) and skin abnormalities, is unknown. "
839,MMP14 ,matrix metallopeptidase 14,"The MMP14 gene (also known as MT1-MMP) provides instructions for making an enzyme called matrix metallopeptidase 14. This enzyme is found on the surface of many types of cells. It normally helps modify and break down various components of the extracellular matrix, which is the intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. These changes influence many cell activities and functions. For example, they have been shown to promote cell growth, stimulate cell movement (migration), and trigger the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis).Matrix metallopeptidase 14 also turns on (activates) a protein called matrix metallopeptidase 2 in the extracellular matrix. The activity of matrix metallopeptidase 2 appears to be important for a variety of body functions, including bone remodeling, which is a normal process in which old bone is broken down and new bone is created to replace it.Although most research has focused on the role of matrix metallopeptidase 14 in the extracellular matrix, studies suggest that it may also be involved in signaling pathways within cells. Little is known about this function of the enzyme.","Winchester syndrome At least one mutation in the MMP14 gene has been found to cause Winchester syndrome, a rare inherited bone disease that is characterized by a loss of bone tissue (osteolysis), particularly in the hands and feet, as well as joint and skin abnormalities. The mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in matrix metallopeptidase 14. Specifically, it replaces the amino acid threonine with the amino acid arginine at position 17 (written as Thr17Arg or T17R).The identified mutation alters matrix metallopeptidase 14 so that less of the enzyme is able to reach the cell surface. As a result, not enough of the enzyme is available to break down components of the extracellular matrix and activate matrix metallopeptidase 2. It is unclear how a shortage of this enzyme leads to the signs and symptoms of Winchester syndrome. It is possible that a loss of matrix metallopeptidase 2 activation somehow disrupts the balance of new bone creation and the breakdown of existing bone during bone remodeling, causing a progressive loss of bone tissue. How a reduced amount of matrix metallopeptidase 14 leads to the other features of Winchester syndrome is unknown. "
840,MMP20 ,matrix metallopeptidase 20,"The MMP20 gene provides instructions for making a protein called enamelysin, which is essential for normal tooth development. Enamelysin is involved in the formation of enamel, which is the hard, white material that forms the protective outer layer of each tooth. Enamel is composed mainly of mineral crystals. These microscopic crystals are arranged in organized bundles that give enamel its strength and durability.Certain proteins are needed to shape and organize the crystals as they form, but these proteins must be removed for enamel to harden normally. Enamelysin cuts (cleaves) other proteins involved in enamel formation, such as amelogenin and ameloblastin, into smaller pieces. Cleavage of these proteins makes them easier to remove when they are no longer needed.","Amelogenesis imperfecta At least seven mutations in the MMP20 gene have been identified in people with an autosomal recessive form of a disorder of tooth development called amelogenesis imperfecta. Autosomal recessive inheritance means that two copies of the MMP20 gene in each cell are altered. The MMP20 gene mutations involved in this condition prevent cells from producing functional enamelysin. Without this protein's function, amelogenin and other proteins are not cleaved during enamel formation. Because these proteins remain in the enamel, it does not harden during its formation. The resulting enamel is soft and has an abnormal crystal structure. Teeth with this defective enamel are abnormally rough, discolored, and prone to breakage. "
841,MMUT ,methylmalonyl-CoA mutase,"The MMUT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called methylmalonyl CoA mutase. This enzyme is active in mitochondria, which are specialized structures inside cells that serve as energy-producing centers.Methylmalonyl CoA mutase is responsible for a particular step in the breakdown of several protein building blocks (amino acids), specifically isoleucine, methionine, threonine, and valine. The enzyme also helps break down certain types of fats (lipids) and cholesterol. First, several chemical reactions convert the amino acids, lipids, or cholesterol to a molecule called methylmalonyl CoA. Then, working with a compound called adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), which is a form of vitamin B12, methylmalonyl CoA mutase converts methylmalonyl CoA to a compound called succinyl-CoA. Other enzymes break down succinyl-CoA into molecules that are later used for energy.","Methylmalonic acidemia More than 200 mutations in the MMUT gene have been identified in people with methylmalonic acidemia, a condition characterized by feeding difficulties, developmental delay, and long-term health problems. These genetic changes prevent the production of functional methylmalonyl CoA mutase or reduce the activity of the enzyme. As a result, certain proteins and lipids are not broken down properly. This defect allows methylmalonyl CoA and other toxic compounds to build up in the body's organs and tissues, causing the signs and symptoms of methylmalonic acidemia.Mutations that prevent the production of any functional methylmalonyl CoA mutase lead to a form of methylmalonic acidemia designated mut0. Mut0 is the most severe form of this disorder and has the poorest outcome. Mutations that alter the structure of the enzyme but do not completely eliminate its activity lead to a form of the condition designated mut-. The mut- form is typically less severe, with more variable symptoms than the mut0 form. "
842,MOCOS ,molybdenum cofactor sulfurase,"The MOCOS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called molybdenum cofactor sulfurase. This enzyme is necessary for the function of two other enzymes, xanthine dehydrogenase and aldehyde oxidase. Xanthine dehydrogenase is involved in the normal breakdown of purines, which are building blocks of DNA and its chemical cousin, RNA. Specifically, it carries out the final two steps in the process: the conversion of a molecule called hypoxanthine to another molecule called xanthine, and the conversion of xanthine to uric acid, a waste product that is normally excreted in urine and feces. Less is known about the function of aldehyde oxidase, although it appears to play a role in the breakdown (metabolism) of many different compounds.Molybdenum cofactor sulfurase carries out a chemical reaction that adds sulfur to a molecule called the molybdenum cofactor. This molecule is required for xanthine dehydrogenase and aldehyde oxidase to be turned on (activated) and carry out their functions.","Hereditary xanthinuria At least four mutations in the MOCOS gene have been found to cause hereditary xanthinuria type II, a condition that most often affects the kidneys. Most of these mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in molybdenum cofactor sulfurase. The effects of these mutations are not fully understood, but they likely alter the shape and function of the enzyme. If molybdenum cofactor sulfurase is unable to add sulfur to the molybdenum cofactor, xanthine dehydrogenase and aldehyde oxidase are not activated. The loss of aldehyde oxidase activity does not appear to cause any signs or symptoms. However, the loss of xanthine dehydrogenase activity prevents the conversion of xanthine to uric acid, leading to an accumulation of xanthine in the kidneys and other tissues. The excess xanthine can form tiny crystals that accumulate in the kidneys, occasionally leading to the formation of stones that can impair kidney function and ultimately cause kidney failure. Less commonly, xanthine crystals build up in the muscles, causing pain and cramping. In some people with hereditary xanthinuria type II, the condition does not cause any health problems. "
843,MOCS1 ,molybdenum cofactor synthesis 1,"The MOCS1 gene provides instructions for making two different proteins, MOCS1A and MOCS1B. Both are involved in the formation (biosynthesis) of a molecule called molybdenum cofactor. Specifically, MOCS1A and MOCS1B perform the first of a series of reactions that produce the cofactor, although the function of MOCS1B in this process is not understood. Molybdenum cofactor, which contains the element molybdenum, is essential to the function of several enzymes called sulfite oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, xanthine dehydrogenase, and mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component (mARC). These enzymes help break down (metabolize) different substances in the body, some of which are toxic if not metabolized.","Molybdenum cofactor deficiency MOCS1 gene mutations cause a disorder called molybdenum cofactor deficiency. This disorder is characterized by seizures that begin early in life and brain dysfunction that worsens over time (encephalopathy); the condition is usually fatal by early childhood. At least 32 mutations in the MOCS1 gene have been found to cause a form of the disorder designated type A or complementation group A. This is the most common form of the condition, accounting for approximately two-thirds of cases.The MOCS1 gene mutations involved in molybdenum cofactor deficiency likely eliminate the function of MOCS1A, MOCS1B, or both, although in rare cases that are less severe, some protein function may remain. Without the activity of one or both of these proteins, molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis is impaired. Loss of the cofactor impedes the function of the metabolic enzymes that rely on it.The resulting loss of enzyme activity leads to buildup of certain chemicals, including sulfite, S-sulfocysteine, xanthine, and hypoxanthine, and low levels of another chemical called uric acid. (Testing for these chemicals can help in the diagnosis of this condition.) Sulfite, which is normally broken down by sulfite oxidase, is toxic, especially to the brain. Researchers suggest that damage caused by the abnormally high levels of sulfite (and possibly other chemicals) leads to encephalopathy, seizures, and the other features of molybdenum cofactor deficiency. "
844,MOCS2 ,molybdenum cofactor synthesis 2,"The MOCS2 gene provides instructions for making two different proteins, MOCS2A and MOCS2B, which combine to form an enzyme called molybdopterin synthase. Molybdopterin synthase performs the second of a series of reactions in the formation (biosynthesis) of a molecule called molybdenum cofactor. Molybdenum cofactor, which contains the element molybdenum, is essential to the function of several enzymes called sulfite oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, xanthine dehydrogenase, and mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component (mARC). These enzymes help break down (metabolize) different substances in the body, some of which are toxic if not metabolized.","Molybdenum cofactor deficiency MOCS2 gene mutations cause a disorder called molybdenum cofactor deficiency. This disorder is characterized by seizures that begin early in life and brain dysfunction that worsens over time (encephalopathy); the condition is usually fatal by early childhood. At least a dozen mutations in the MOCS2 gene have been found to cause a form of the disorder designated type B or complementation group B.The MOCS2 gene mutations involved in molybdenum cofactor deficiency likely eliminate the function of MOCS2A, MOCS2B, or both, although in rare cases that are less severe, some protein function may remain. Without either piece of molybdopterin synthase, molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis is impaired. Loss of the cofactor impedes the function of the metabolic enzymes that rely on it.The resulting loss of enzyme activity leads to buildup of certain chemicals, including sulfite, S-sulfocysteine, xanthine, and hypoxanthine, and low levels of another chemical called uric acid. (Testing for these chemicals can help in the diagnosis of this condition.) Sulfite, which is normally broken down by sulfite oxidase, is toxic, especially to the brain. Researchers suggest that damage caused by the abnormally high levels of sulfite (and possibly other chemicals) leads to encephalopathy, seizures, and the other features of molybdenum cofactor deficiency. "
845,MPL ,"MPL proto-oncogene, thrombopoietin receptor","The MPL gene provides instructions for making the thrombopoietin receptor protein, which promotes the growth and division (proliferation) of cells. This receptor is especially important for the proliferation of certain blood cells called megakaryocytes, which produce platelets, the cells involved in blood clotting. Research suggests that the thrombopoietin receptor may also play a role in the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells, which are stem cells located within the bone marrow that have the potential to develop into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.The thrombopoietin receptor is turned on (activated) when a protein called thrombopoietin attaches (binds) to it. The activated thrombopoietin receptor stimulates a signaling pathway called the JAK/STAT pathway, which transmits chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus and is important for controlling the production of blood cells.","Essential thrombocythemia Several mutations in the MPL gene have been associated with a small number of cases of essential thrombocythemia, a condition characterized by an increased number of platelets in the blood. Platelets are the blood cells involved in blood clotting, and abnormal clotting (thrombosis) is common in people with essential thrombocythemia.MPL gene mutations associated with essential thrombocythemia change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the thrombopoietin receptor protein. An inherited form of the condition, called familial essential thrombocythemia, is caused by an MPL gene mutation that results in the replacement of the amino acid serine with the amino acid asparagine at position 505 in the protein (written as Ser505Asn or S505N). Essential thrombocythemia that does not run in families (sporadic essential thrombocythemia) has been associated with MPL gene mutations that result in the replacement of the amino acid tryptophan at position 515 with another amino acid, most commonly leucine. These mutations are generally referred to as W515 mutations.Amino acid changes at position 505 or 515 result in a thrombopoietin receptor protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated), which, in essential thrombocythemia, leads to the overproduction of abnormal megakaryocytes and an increased number of platelets. Excess platelets can cause thrombosis, which leads to many signs and symptoms of essential thrombocythemia. "
846,MPLKIP ,M-phase specific PLK1 interacting protein,"The MPLKIP gene (formerly known as C7orf11) provides instructions for making a protein called M-phase specific PLK1 interacting protein. The function of this protein is unclear. Based on its interaction with a protein called Plk1, the MPLKIP protein is thought to play a role in cell growth and division. In particular, it may help regulate the cell cycle, which is the cell's way of replicating itself in an organized, step-by-step fashion. Researchers speculate that the MPLKIP protein may also be involved in gene transcription, which is the first step in protein production.","Trichothiodystrophy At least eight mutations in the MPLKIP gene have been identified in people with trichothiodystrophy. These mutations cause some cases of the non-photosensitive form of the disorder, which is not associated with extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight.All of the known MPLKIP gene mutations prevent the production of any functional MPLKIP protein. It is unknown how a loss of this protein leads to the characteristic features of trichothiodystrophy, including slow growth, intellectual disability, and brittle hair. "
847,MPV17 ,mitochondrial inner membrane protein MPV17,"The MPV17 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is largely unknown. The MPV17 protein is located in the inner membrane of cell structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria are involved in a wide variety of cellular activities, including energy production, chemical signaling, and regulation of cell growth and division. Mitochondria contain their own DNA, known as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is essential for the normal function of these structures. It is likely that the MPV17 protein is involved in the maintenance of mtDNA. Having an adequate amount of mtDNA is essential for normal energy production within cells.","MPV17-related hepatocerebral mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome More than 30 mutations in the MPV17 gene have been found to cause MPV17-related hepatocerebral mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, a condition characterized by liver disease and neurological problems that begin in infancy. Most of the mutations that cause this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the MPV17 protein. One mutation that almost exclusively affects the Navajo population of the southwestern United States replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid glutamine at position 50 in the protein (written as R50Q). This mutation results in the production of an unstable MPV17 protein that is quickly broken down. When the condition occurs in people of Navajo ancestry, it is called Navajo neurohepatopathy.The changes in the MPV17 protein that cause MPV17-related hepatocerebral mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, including the R50Q mutation, impair protein function and reduce the amount of protein that is available. A dysfunctional or absent MPV17 protein leads to problems with the maintenance of mtDNA, which can cause a reduction in the amount of mtDNA (known as mitochondrial DNA depletion). Mitochondrial DNA depletion impairs mitochondrial function in many of the body's cells and tissues, particularly the brain, liver, and other tissues that have high energy requirements. Reduced mitochondrial function in the liver and brain lead to the liver failure and neurological dysfunction associated with MPV17-related hepatocerebral mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. Researchers suggest that the less mtDNA that is available in cells, the more severe the features of Navajo neurohepatopathy. "
848,MPZ ,myelin protein zero,"The MPZ gene provides instructions for making a protein called myelin protein zero. It is the most abundant protein in myelin, a protective substance that covers nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. Myelin protein zero is produced by specialized cells called Schwann cells, which wrap around and insulate peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves connect the brain and spinal cord to muscles and to sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and sound. Myelin protein zero is required for the proper formation and maintenance of myelin. This protein is an adhesion molecule, which means it acts like molecular glue. It plays a role in tightly packing the myelin around nerve cells (myelin compaction).","Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Researchers have identified more than 120 MPZ gene mutations that cause a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease known as type 1B. Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome is a disorder characterized by muscle weakness and sensory problems, especially in the hands and feet. Many of the MPZ gene mutations that cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in myelin protein zero. Other mutations lead to a protein that is missing one or more amino acids. The altered myelin protein zero probably cannot interact properly with other myelin components, which may disrupt myelin compaction. As a result, peripheral nerves cannot trigger muscle movement or relay information from sensory cells back to the brain, leading to the weakness and sensory problems characteristic of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.Some MPZ gene mutations cause a severe form of type 1B Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Symptoms begin during infancy or early childhood and include delayed development of motor skills such as walking. This form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is sometimes called Dejerine-Sottas syndrome, congenital hypomyelination, or Roussy-Levy syndrome. Researchers believe that the MPZ gene mutations that cause the severe form of the disorder probably disrupt the formation of myelin during early development.Several mutations in the MPZ gene cause other forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease known as type 2I, type 2J, and dominant intermediate D. These forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which often do not become evident until adulthood, affect the specialized outgrowths from nerve cells (axons) that transmit impulses to muscles and other nerve cells. People with type 2J Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease may also have hearing loss and abnormalities in the opening of the eye through which light passes (the pupil). It is unclear how MPZ gene mutations cause these abnormalities. "
849,MRAP ,melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein,"The MRAP gene provides instructions for making a protein called melanocortin-2 receptor accessory protein (MRAP). This protein transports another protein, called the melanocortin-2 receptor (or more commonly the adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] receptor), from the interior of the cell to the cell surface. Specifically, the MRAP protein transports the ACTH receptor from a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is involved in protein processing and transport, to the cell membrane so that the receptor can function. The MRAP protein is also needed to turn on (activate) the ACTH receptor.At the cell membrane, the activated ACTH receptor attaches (binds) to ACTH, which triggers the production of a group of hormones called glucocorticoids. These hormones, which include cortisol and corticosterone, aid in immune system function, play a role in maintaining normal blood sugar levels, help trigger nerve cell signaling in the brain, and serve many other purposes in the body.","Familial glucocorticoid deficiency At least 13 mutations in the MRAP gene have been found to cause familial glucocorticoid deficiency. This condition is characterized by potentially life-threatening low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), recurrent infections, and skin coloring darker than that of other family members (hyperpigmentation). MRAP gene mutations account for approximately 20 percent of cases of this condition. Most of these mutations lead to the production of a protein that cannot interact with the ACTH receptor and so is unable to transport it out of the ER to the cell membrane. As a result, the ACTH receptor is not at the cell surface where it is needed to bind to ACTH. Without the binding of the ACTH receptor to its hormone, there is no signal to trigger the adrenal glands to produce glucocorticoids. A shortage of these hormones impairs blood sugar regulation, immune system function, and other cellular functions, leading to the signs and symptoms of familial glucocorticoid deficiency. "
850,MSH2 ,mutS homolog 2,"The MSH2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an essential role in DNA repair. This protein helps fix errors that are made when DNA is copied (DNA replication) in preparation for cell division. The MSH2 protein joins with one of two other proteins, MSH6 or MSH3 (each produced from a different gene), to form a protein complex. This complex identifies locations on the DNA where errors have been made during DNA replication. Another group of proteins, the MLH1-PMS2 protein complex, then repairs the errors. The MSH2 gene is a member of a set of genes known as the mismatch repair (MMR) genes.","Lynch syndrome About 40 percent of all cases of Lynch syndrome with an identified gene mutation are associated with inherited mutations in the MSH2 gene. Lynch syndrome increases the risk of many types of cancer, particularly cancers of the colon (large intestine) and rectum, which are collectively referred to as colorectal cancer. People with Lynch syndrome also have an increased risk of cancers of the endometrium (lining of the uterus), ovaries, stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder duct, upper urinary tract, and brain.MSH2 gene mutations involved in Lynch syndrome may cause the production of an abnormally short or inactive MSH2 protein that cannot perform its normal function. When the MSH2 protein is absent or nonfunctional, the number of DNA errors that are left unrepaired during cell division increases substantially. The errors accumulate as the cells continue to divide, which may cause the cells to function abnormally, increasing the risk of tumor formation in the colon or another part of the body.Some mutations in the MSH2 gene cause a variant of Lynch syndrome called Muir-Torre syndrome. In addition to colorectal cancer, people with this condition have an increased risk of developing several uncommon skin tumors. These rare skin tumors include sebaceous adenomas and carcinomas, which occur in glands that produce an oily substance called sebum (sebaceous glands). Multiple rapidly growing tumors called keratoacanthomas may also occur, usually on sun-exposed areas of skin. "
851,MSH6 ,mutS homolog 6,"The MSH6 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an essential role in repairing DNA. This protein helps fix errors that are made when DNA is copied (DNA replication) in preparation for cell division. The MSH6 protein joins with another protein called MSH2 (produced from the MSH2 gene) to form a protein complex. This complex identifies locations on the DNA where errors have been made during DNA replication. Another group of proteins, the MLH1-PMS2 protein complex, then repairs the errors. The MSH6 gene is a member of a set of genes known as the mismatch repair (MMR) genes.","Lynch syndrome Mutations in the MSH6 gene have been reported in about 10 percent of families with Lynch syndrome that have an identified gene mutation. Lynch syndrome increases the risk of many types of cancer, particularly cancers of the colon (large intestine) and rectum, which are collectively referred to as colorectal cancer. People with Lynch syndrome also have an increased risk of cancers of the endometrium (lining of the uterus), ovaries, stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder duct, upper urinary tract, and brain. Endometrial cancer is especially common in women with Lynch syndrome caused by MSH6 gene mutations.MSH6 gene mutations involved in this condition lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional MSH6 protein or a partially active version of the protein. When the MSH6 protein is absent or nonfunctional, the number of errors that are left unrepaired during cell division increases substantially. The errors accumulate as the cells continue to divide, which may cause the cells to function abnormally, increasing the risk of tumor formation in the colon or another part of the body.In a small number of people, mutations in the MSH6 gene cause a variant of Lynch syndrome called Muir-Torre syndrome. In addition to colorectal cancer, people with this condition have an increased risk of developing several uncommon skin tumors. These rare skin tumors include sebaceous adenomas and carcinomas, which occur in glands that produce an oily substance called sebum (sebaceous glands). Multiple rapidly growing tumors called keratoacanthomas may also occur, usually on sun-exposed areas of skin. "
852,MSTN ,myostatin,"The MSTN gene provides instructions for making a protein called myostatin. This protein is part of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) superfamily, which is a group of proteins that help control the growth and development of tissues throughout the body. Myostatin is found almost exclusively in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles), where it is active both before and after birth. This protein normally restrains muscle growth, ensuring that muscles do not grow too large. Myostatin has been studied extensively in mice, cows, and other animals, and it appears to have a similar function in humans.Researchers are studying myostatin as a potential treatment for various muscular dystrophies that cause muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy).","Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy At least one mutation in the MSTN gene has been found to cause myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy, a rare condition characterized by increased muscle mass and strength. The mutation, which is written as IVS1+5G>A, disrupts the way the gene's instructions are used to make myostatin. As a result, cells produce little or no functional myostatin. A loss of this protein in muscle cells leads to an overgrowth of muscle tissue. It does not appear to cause any other medical problems in affected individuals. "
853,MSX1 ,msh homeobox 1,"The MSX1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that regulates the activity of other genes. The MSX1 gene is part of a larger family of homeobox genes, which act during early development to control the formation of many body structures. Specifically, this gene is critical for the normal development of the teeth and other structures in the mouth. It may also be important for development of the fingernails and toenails.","Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome The MSX1 gene is often deleted in people with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, even though it is located outside the region of chromosome 4 that is typically deleted in people with this condition. A loss of the MSX1 gene probably disrupts the regulation of several other genes, particularly genes involved in the development of the mouth and teeth. Researchers believe that a deletion of the MSX1 gene disrupts the formation of oral structures in early development, leading to missing teeth and other dental abnormalities. A loss of the MSX1 gene probably also causes an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) and/or a split in the upper lip (cleft lip) in some people with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. "
854,MSX2 ,msh homeobox 2,"The MSX2 gene provides instructions for producing a protein that is necessary for proper development of cells and tissues throughout the body. The MSX2 protein is a transcription factor, which means it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of certain genes. Specifically, the protein controls the activity of genes that regulate cell growth and division (proliferation), cell maturation and specialization (differentiation), and cell survival. The regulation of these functions ensures that cells start and stop growing at specific times and that they are positioned correctly during development.The MSX2 protein is part of a chemical signaling pathway known as the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) pathway. This signaling pathway regulates various cellular processes and is involved in the growth of cells, including new bone cells. The MSX2 protein seems to be particularly critical for the development of the skull.","Enlarged parietal foramina At least 10 mutations in the MSX2 gene have been identified in people with enlarged parietal foramina type 1. This condition is characterized by enlarged openings (foramina) in the parietal bones, which are the two bones that form the top and sides of the skull. Openings in the parietal bones are normal during fetal development, but they usually close before birth. In people with this condition, the parietal foramina remain open throughout life.The mutations that cause enlarged parietal foramina result in the production of an MSX2 protein that cannot bind to DNA, which alters the regulation of multiple genes. As a result, several cell processes are disrupted, including proliferation, differentiation, and survival. In early development, the skull seems to be particularly sensitive to changes in MSX2 protein activity and changes in cell function. Specifically, cells in the skull that are involved in bone formation (ossification) cannot function normally, leading to a lack of bone in areas of the skull and enlarged parietal foramina. "
855,MT-ATP6 ,mitochondrially encoded ATP synthase membrane subunit 6,"The MT-ATP6 gene provides information for making a protein that is essential for normal mitochondrial function. Mitochondria are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. These cellular structures produce energy through a process called oxidative phosphorylation, which uses oxygen and simple sugars to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source.The MT-ATP6 protein forms one part (subunit) of a large enzyme called ATP synthase. This enzyme, which is also known as complex V, is responsible for the final step of oxidative phosphorylation. Specifically, one segment of ATP synthase allows positively charged particles, called protons, to flow across a specialized membrane inside mitochondria. Another segment of the enzyme uses the energy created by this proton flow to convert a molecule called adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to ATP.","Leigh syndrome Mutations in the MT-ATP6 gene have been found in approximately 10 percent of people with Leigh syndrome. Leigh syndrome is a progressive brain disorder that usually appears in infancy or early childhood. Affected children may experience delayed development, muscle weakness, problems with movement, or difficulty breathing.MT-ATP6 gene mutations associated with Leigh syndrome change one DNA building block (nucleotide) in the MT-ATP6 gene. The most common genetic change replaces the nucleotide thymine with the nucleotide guanine at position 8993 (written as T8993G). The mutations that cause Leigh syndrome impair the function or stability of the ATP synthase complex, inhibiting ATP production and impairing oxidative phosphorylation.Although the exact mechanism is unclear, researchers believe that impaired oxidative phosphorylation can lead to cell death because of decreased energy available in the cell. Certain tissues that require large amounts of energy, such as the brain, muscles, and heart, seem especially sensitive to decreases in cellular energy. Cell death in the brain and in other sensitive tissues likely cause the characteristic signs and symptoms of Leigh syndrome. "
856,MT-CYB ,mitochondrially encoded cytochrome b,"The MT-CYB gene provides instructions for making a protein called cytochrome b. This protein plays a key role in structures called mitochondria, which convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Cytochrome b is one of 11 components of a group of proteins called complex III. In mitochondria, complex III performs one step of a process known as oxidative phosphorylation, in which oxygen and simple sugars are used to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source. During oxidative phosphorylation, the protein complexes, including complex III, drive the production of ATP through a step-by-step transfer of negatively charged particles called electrons. Cytochrome b is involved in the transfer of these particles through complex III.Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus (nuclear DNA), mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA, called mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). This type of DNA contains many genes essential for normal mitochondrial function. Cytochrome b is the only component of complex III that is produced from a gene found in mitochondrial DNA.","Mitochondrial complex III deficiency Mutations in the MT-CYB gene can cause mitochondrial complex III deficiency. When caused by mutations in this gene, the condition is usually characterized by muscle weakness (myopathy) and pain, especially during exercise (exercise intolerance). More severely affected individuals can have problems with other body systems, including the liver, kidneys, heart, and brain.Most MT-CYB gene mutations that cause mitochondrial complex III deficiency change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the cytochrome b protein or lead to an abnormally short protein. These cytochrome b alterations impair the formation of complex III, severely reducing the complex's activity and oxidative phosphorylation. Researchers believe that impaired oxidative phosphorylation can lead to cell death by reducing the amount of energy available in the cell. It is thought that tissues that require a lot of energy, such as those in the muscles, brain, heart, liver, and kidneys, are most affected by a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation. Damage to these tissues and organs leads to the various features of mitochondrial complex III deficiency.The location of the MT-CYB gene in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) may help explain why some people have more severe features of the condition than others. Most of the body's cells contain thousands of mitochondria, each with one or more copies of mitochondrial DNA. These cells can have a mix of mitochondria containing mutated and unmutated DNA (heteroplasmy). The severity of mitochondrial complex III deficiency caused by MT-CYB gene mutations is thought to be associated with the percentage of mitochondria with the mitochondrial DNA mutation. In most people with MT-CYB-related mitochondrial complex III deficiency, the percentage of mutated mitochondrial DNA is highest in the skeletal muscles, which explains the finding of myopathy in these individuals. It is unclear why the mutation is most prevalent in muscle tissue. "
857,MT-ND1 ,mitochondrially encoded NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit 1,"The MT-ND1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called NADH dehydrogenase 1. This protein is part of a large enzyme complex known as complex I, which is active in mitochondria. Mitochondria are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. These cellular structures produce energy through a process called oxidative phosphorylation, which uses oxygen and simple sugars to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source.Complex I is one of several enzyme complexes necessary for oxidative phosphorylation. Within mitochondria, these complexes are embedded in a tightly folded, specialized membrane called the inner mitochondrial membrane. During oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial enzyme complexes carry out chemical reactions that drive the production of ATP. Specifically, they create an unequal electrical charge on either side of the inner mitochondrial membrane through a step-by-step transfer of negatively charged particles called electrons. This difference in electrical charge provides the energy for ATP production.Complex I is responsible for the first step in the electron transport process, the transfer of electrons from a molecule called NADH to another molecule called ubiquinone. Electrons are then passed from ubiquinone through several other enzyme complexes to provide energy for the generation of ATP.","Leber hereditary optic neuropathy Several mutations in the MT-ND1 gene are known to cause Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. Each of these mutations changes a single DNA building block (nucleotide) in the gene. One common MT-ND1 mutation is responsible for about 13 percent of all cases of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. This mutation replaces the nucleotide guanine with the nucleotide adenine at gene position 3460 (written as G3460A). This change is associated with moderately severe cases of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy; however, 20 percent to 40 percent of people with vision loss due to this mutation experience some recovery of vision.Researchers are investigating how mutations in the MT-ND1 gene lead to Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. These genetic changes appear to disrupt the normal activity of complex I in the mitochondrial inner membrane, which may affect the generation of ATP. MT-ND1 mutations also may increase the production within mitochondria of potentially harmful molecules called reactive oxygen species. It remains unclear, however, why the effects of these mutations are often limited to the nerve that relays visual information from the eye to the brain (the optic nerve). Additional genetic and environmental factors probably contribute to the vision loss and other medical problems associated with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. "
858,MT-ND4 ,mitochondrially encoded NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit 4,"The MT-ND4 gene provides instructions for making a protein called NADH dehydrogenase 4.

Each of these mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the NADH dehydrogenase 4 protein. One MT-ND4 mutation is the most common cause of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy; it is responsible for about 70 percent of all cases worldwide. This mutation, which can be written as G11778A or Arg340His, replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid histidine at protein position 340. This mutation tends to cause severe vision loss, with little chance of recovery.Researchers are investigating how mutations in the MT-ND4 gene lead to Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. These genetic changes appear to prevent complex I from interacting normally with ubiquinone, which may affect the generation of ATP. MT-ND4 mutations may also increase the production within mitochondria of potentially harmful molecules called reactive oxygen species. It remains unclear, however, why the effects of these mutations are often limited to the nerve that relays visual information from the eye to the brain (the optic nerve).

This mutation, which can be written as T10663C or Val65Ala, changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the NADH dehydrogenase 4L protein. Specifically, it replaces the amino acid valine with the amino acid alanine at protein position 65.Researchers have not determined how a mutation in the MT-ND4L gene can lead to the vision loss characteristic of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. This genetic change appears to disrupt the normal activity of complex I in the mitochondrial inner membrane, which may affect the production of ATP. It remains unclear, however, why the effects of this mutation are limited to the nerve that relays visual information from the eye to the brain (the optic nerve). Additional genetic and environmental factors probably contribute to the features of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. "
860,MT-ND5 ,mitochondrially encoded NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit 5,"The MT-ND5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called NADH dehydrogenase 5.

These mutations alter single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the gene. A particular mutation has been identified in at least five people with the characteristic features of MELAS; this mutation replaces the nucleotide guanine with the nucleotide adenine at gene position 13513 (written as G13513A). Most of the MT-ND5 mutations that cause MELAS have been shown to reduce the activity of complex I, which disrupts energy production within mitochondria. Although these abnormalities have the greatest impact on tissues that require a lot of energy (such as the brain and muscles), researchers have not determined how changes in the MT-ND5 gene lead to the specific signs and symptoms of MELAS.Mutations in the MT-ND5 gene also have been identified in patients with the major features of MELAS in combination with other mitochondrial diseases. For example, researchers have found MT-ND5 mutations in several individuals with the signs of MELAS and some features of Leigh syndrome, a progressive brain disorder that typically appears in infancy or early childhood. In other cases, people with MELAS and a change in the MT-ND5 gene have developed sudden, progressive vision loss characteristic of an eye disease called Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. A few individuals have been reported with signs and symptoms of all three of these mitochondrial conditions—MELAS, Leigh syndrome, and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.It is unclear why changes in the MT-ND5 gene can cause such a large variety of signs and symptoms. Even within a single family, affected individuals may have different health problems caused by the same genetic change. "

One common MT-ND6 mutation is responsible for about 14 percent of all cases of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, and it is the most common cause of this disorder among people of French Canadian descent. This genetic change, written as T14484C or Met64Val, replaces the amino acid methionine with the amino acid valine at protein position 64. The T14484C mutation is associated with a good long-term prognosis; affected people with this genetic change have a 37 percent to 65 percent chance of some visual recovery.Researchers are investigating how mutations in the MT-ND6 gene lead to Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. These genetic changes appear to prevent complex I from interacting normally with ubiquinone, which may affect the generation of ATP.

862,MT-TE ,mitochondrially encoded tRNA glutamic acid,"The MT-TE gene provides instructions for making a molecule called a transfer RNA (tRNA), which is a chemical cousin of DNA. Transfer RNAs help assemble protein building blocks (amino acids) into functioning proteins. The MT-TE gene provides instructions for making a specific form of tRNA that is designated as tRNAGlu. During protein assembly, this molecule attaches to the amino acid glutamic acid (Glu) and inserts it into the appropriate locations in the growing protein.The tRNAGlu molecule is present only in cellular compartments called mitochondria. These structures convert energy from food into a form that cells can use. Through a process called oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondria use oxygen, simple sugars, and fatty acids to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source. The tRNAGlu molecule is involved in the assembly of proteins that carry out oxidative phosphorylation.In certain cells in the pancreas, called beta cells, mitochondria also play a role in controlling the amount of sugar (glucose) in the bloodstream. In response to high glucose levels, mitochondria help trigger the release of a hormone called insulin. Insulin regulates blood sugar levels by controlling how much glucose is passed from the blood into cells to be converted into energy.","Maternally inherited diabetes and deafness A mutation in the MT-TE gene has been found in a small number of people with maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD). People with this condition have diabetes and sometimes hearing loss, particularly of high tones. Affected individuals may also have muscle weakness (myopathy) and problems with their eyes, heart, or kidneys. The mutation involved in this condition replaces the DNA building block (nucleotide) thymine with the nucleotide cytosine at position 14709 (written as T14709C). This mutation likely impairs the ability of mitochondria to help trigger insulin release. In affected individuals, diabetes results when the beta cells do not produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar effectively. Researchers have not determined how the T14709C mutation leads to hearing loss or the other features of MIDD. "
863,MT-TH ,mitochondrially encoded tRNA histidine,"The MT-TH gene provides instructions for making a particular type of RNA, a molecule that is a chemical cousin of DNA.

This condition is characterized by recurrent severe headaches, muscle weakness (myopathy), hearing loss, stroke-like episodes including a loss of consciousness, seizures, and other problems affecting the nervous system. Some people with an MT-TH gene mutation also have features of another mitochondrial disorder called myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF); these additional features can include muscle twitches (myoclonus), difficulty coordinating movement (ataxia), and abnormal muscle cells known as ragged-red fibers. This combination of signs and symptoms is called MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome.MT-TH gene mutations that cause MELAS and MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the gene.

In these cases, affected individuals typically have muscle twitches (myoclonus), muscle weakness (myopathy), difficulty coordinating movement (ataxia), hearing loss, seizures, and intellectual impairment. Two mutations in the MT-TS1 gene have been found to cause these symptoms. One mutation replaces the DNA building block (nucleotide) thymine with the nucleotide cytosine at gene position 7512 (written as T7512C). The other mutation inserts an extra cytosine at position 7472 (written as 7472insC). Researchers have not determined how these genetic changes cause variant forms of MERRF. "
867,MT-TV ,mitochondrially encoded tRNA valine,"The MT-TV gene provides instructions for making a particular type of RNA, a molecule that is a chemical cousin of DNA. This type of RNA, called transfer RNA (tRNA), helps assemble protein building blocks known as amino acids into full-length, functioning proteins. The MT-TV gene provides instructions for a specific form of transfer RNA that is designated as tRNAVal. This molecule attaches to a particular amino acid, valine (Val), and inserts it into the appropriate locations in many different proteins.The tRNAVal molecule is present only in cellular structures called mitochondria. These structures convert energy from food into a form that cells can use. Through a process called oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondria use oxygen and simple sugars to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source. The tRNAVal molecule is involved in the assembly of proteins that carry out oxidative phosphorylation.","Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes Mutations in the MT-TV gene are a very rare cause of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Most cases of MELAS are caused by mutations in other mitochondrial genes, but a small number of cases resulting from mutations in the MT-TV gene have been reported. At least two mutations have been identified, each of which alters a single DNA building block (nucleotide) in the gene. One of these mutations replaces the nucleotide guanine with the nucleotide adenine at gene position 1642 (written as G1642A). Another mutation changes the nucleotide guanine to the nucleotide adenine at position 1644 (G1644A). Changes in the MT-TV gene may reduce the amount of tRNAVal available to assemble proteins within mitochondria. Because these proteins are needed for oxidative phosphorylation, MT-TV mutations may impair the ability of mitochondria to produce energy. Researchers have not determined how changes in mitochondrial energy production can lead to the specific features of MELAS. "
868,MTHFR ,methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase,"The MTHFR gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. This enzyme plays a role in processing amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase is important for a chemical reaction involving the vitamin folate (also called vitamin B9). Specifically, this enzyme converts a form of folate called 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to a different form of folate called 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. This is the primary form of folate found in blood, and is necessary for the multistep process that converts the amino acid homocysteine to another amino acid, methionine. The body uses methionine to make proteins and other important compounds.","Homocystinuria At least 40 mutations in the MTHFR gene have been identified in people with homocystinuria, a disorder in which the body is unable to process homocysteine and methionine properly. People with this condition often develop eye problems, abnormal blood clotting, skeletal abnormalities, and learning problems. Most of the mutations that cause homocystinuria change single amino acids in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. These changes impair the function of the enzyme, and some cause the enzyme to be turned off (inactivated). Other mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the enzyme. Without functional methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, homocysteine cannot be converted to methionine. As a result, homocysteine builds up in the bloodstream, and the amount of methionine is reduced. Some of the excess homocysteine is excreted in urine (homocystinuria). Researchers have not determined how altered levels of homocysteine and methionine lead to the various health problems affecting multiple parts of the body in people with homocystinuria. "
869,MTM1 ,myotubularin 1,"The MTM1 gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called myotubularin. Myotubularin is thought to be involved in the development and maintenance of muscle cells. This enzyme acts as a phosphatase, which means that it removes clusters of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (phosphate groups) from other molecules. Myotubularin removes phosphate groups from two molecules called phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-biphosphate. These molecules are found within cell membranes and are likely involved in transporting molecules within cells.","X-linked myotubular myopathy More than 200 mutations in the MTM1 gene have been found to cause X-linked myotubular myopathy. Some MTM1 gene mutations change one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) in myotubularin, while other mutations result in an abnormally short, nonfunctional enzyme. The MTM1 gene mutations that prevent the production of any functional myotubularin tend to result in a more severe disease. Individuals who are mildly affected tend to have an MTM1 mutation that allows some functional myotubularin to be produced.Mutations in the MTM1 gene are thought to disrupt myotubularin's role in muscle cell development and maintenance, causing muscle weakness and other signs and symptoms of X-linked myotubular myopathy. "
870,MTOR ,mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase,"The MTOR gene provides instructions for making a protein called mTOR. This protein is found in various cell types throughout the body including brain cells. It interacts with other proteins to form two distinct protein groups, called mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Both of these complexes transmit signals that direct the cells' function. Signaling through mTORC1 and mTORC2 regulate protein production, which influences cell growth, division, and survival. This mTOR signaling is especially important for growth and development of the brain, and it plays a role in a process called synaptic plasticity, which is the ability of the connections between nerve cells (synapses) to change and adapt over time in response to experience. Synaptic plasticity is critical for learning and memory.","Smith-Kingsmore syndrome Mutations in the MTOR gene cause a neurological disorder called Smith-Kingsmore syndrome. Individuals with this condition typically have a head that is larger than normal (macrocephaly), intellectual disability, and seizures. Affected individuals can also have unusual facial features, a behavioral condition called attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or autism spectrum disorder, which affects communication and social interaction.MTOR gene mutations that cause Smith-Kingsmore syndrome are germline mutations, which means they are present in cells throughout the body. The most common mutation, found in nearly half of affected individuals, changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the mTOR protein. Specifically, the amino acid glutamic acid is replaced by the amino acid lysine at protein position 1799 (written as Glu1799Lys or E1799K). This and other MTOR gene mutations are called ""gain-of-function"" because they increase the activity of the mTOR protein and, consequently, mTOR signaling. As a result, protein production normally regulated by mTORC1 or mTORC2 is uncontrolled, which impacts cell growth and division and other cellular processes. Too much mTOR signaling in brain cells disrupts brain growth and development and synaptic plasticity, leading to macrocephaly, intellectual disability, seizures, and other neurological problems in people with Smith-Kingsmore syndrome. Excessive mTOR signaling in other parts of the body likely underlies other, less common signs and symptoms of the condition. "
871,MTR ,5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase,"The MTR gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called methionine synthase. This enzyme plays a role in processing amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Specifically, methionine synthase carries out a chemical reaction that converts the amino acid homocysteine to another amino acid called methionine. The body uses methionine to make proteins and other important compounds. To function properly, methionine synthase requires methylcobalamin (a form of vitamin B12) and another enzyme called methionine synthase reductase, which is produced from the MTRR gene.","Homocystinuria More than 20 mutations in the MTR gene have been identified in people with homocystinuria. Many of these mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of methionine synthase. Other mutations change single amino acids in the enzyme. One of the most common mutations replaces the amino acid proline with the amino acid leucine at position 1173 (written as Pro1173Leu or P1173L), resulting in an enzyme with reduced function. Without functional methionine synthase, homocysteine cannot be converted to methionine. As a result, homocysteine builds up in the bloodstream, and the amount of methionine is reduced. Some of the excess homocysteine is excreted in urine. Researchers have not determined how altered levels of homocysteine and methionine lead to the health problems associated with homocystinuria. "
872,MTRR ,5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase,"The MTRR gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called methionine synthase reductase. This enzyme is required for the proper function of another enzyme called methionine synthase. Methionine synthase helps process amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. Specifically, it converts the amino acid homocysteine to another amino acid called methionine. After a period of being turned on (active), methionine synthase turns off (becomes inactive). Methionine synthase reductase reactivates methionine synthase so the enzyme can continue to produce methionine.","Homocystinuria At least 20 mutations in the MTRR gene have been identified in people with homocystinuria. Some of these mutations change single amino acids in methionine synthase reductase. Other mutations lead to an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the enzyme. All these mutations prevent the enzyme from functioning normally. Without methionine synthase reductase, methionine synthase cannot convert homocysteine to methionine. As a result, homocysteine builds up in the bloodstream, and the amount of methionine is reduced. Some of the excess homocysteine is excreted in urine. Researchers have not determined how altered levels of homocysteine and methionine lead to the health problems associated with homocystinuria. "
873,MTTP ,microsomal triglyceride transfer protein,"The MTTP gene provides instructions for making a protein called microsomal triglyceride transfer protein. This protein helps produce beta-lipoproteins, which are molecules that are made up of proteins (including one called apolipoprotein B), cholesterol, and particular types of fats called phospholipids and triglycerides.Different types of beta-lipoproteins are made in the intestine and liver. In the intestine, beta-lipoproteins include chylomicrons, which are formed as food is digested after a meal to carry dietary fats and cholesterol from the intestine to the bloodstream. Chylomicrons are also necessary for the absorption of certain fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamins E, A, and K. In the liver, beta-lipoproteins include low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). These lipoproteins transport fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins in the bloodstream to tissues throughout the body. Sufficient levels of fats, cholesterol, and vitamins are necessary for normal growth, development, and maintenance of the body's cells and tissues.","Abetalipoproteinemia More than 60 mutations in the MTTP gene have been found to cause abetalipoproteinemia. This condition impairs the normal absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the diet and primarily affects the gastrointestinal system, eyes, nervous system, and blood.Most MTTP gene mutations lead to the production of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein with reduced or absent function, preventing the formation of beta-lipoproteins. One particular mutation is common in affected individuals of Ashkenazi (eastern and central European) Jewish descent; this mutation replaces the protein building block (amino acid) glycine with a premature stop signal at position 865 (written as Gly865Ter or G865X) in the instructions used to make the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein. As a result of this change, an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the protein is made. All MTTP gene mutations that cause abetalipoproteinemia impair beta-lipoprotein formation and result in a severe shortage of chylomicrons, LDLs, and VLDLs. A lack of these lipoproteins prevents dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins from being absorbed from the diet and transported through the bloodstream to the body's tissues. These nutritional deficiencies lead to health problems in people with abetalipoproteinemia. "
874,MUC1 ,"mucin 1, cell surface associated","The MUC1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called mucin 1. This protein is one of several mucin proteins that make up mucus, a slippery substance that lubricates and protects the lining of the airways, digestive system, reproductive system, and other organs and tissues. In addition to its role in mucus, mucin 1 is involved in cell signaling and kidney development.Although most mucin proteins are released from the cell, mucin 1 spans the cell membrane. It is found in epithelial cells, which are the cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body. In particular, mucin 1 is found in the respiratory tract, female reproductive organs, and gastrointestinal tract. Like other mucins, mucin 1 has a region called the mucin domain that contains repeated stretches of protein building blocks (amino acids); the number of repeats can vary from 20 to 100. This protein is modified by the addition of numerous chains of sugar molecules, which are attached to certain amino acids in the mucin domain. The sugars spread out from the protein like branches on a tree and prevent access to the cell surface below, protecting the body from foreign invaders. The sugars also attract water molecules, helping lubricate and hydrate the tissues.The portion of mucin 1 that reaches inside the cell, called the cytoplasmic tail (or MUC1-CT), relays signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus; these signals instruct the cell to undergo certain changes. Through this process, mucin 1 is thought to be involved in cell growth and division (proliferation), helping cells stick to one another (cell adhesion), cell movement (motility), and cell survival. The cytoplasmic tail can also detach from the cell membrane and move to the nucleus, although the mechanism is unclear. Some researchers suggest that, in the nucleus, MUC1-CT helps control the activity of other genes. In addition, mucin 1 is present in cells that form the kidneys and is thought to play a role in development of these organs.","Medullary cystic kidney disease type 1 Mutations in the MUC1 gene cause medullary cystic kidney disease type 1 (MCKD1). This condition is characterized by impairment of kidney function that usually begins in adulthood and progressively worsens. Some affected individuals develop fluid-filled pockets in the kidneys called medullary cysts.This condition occurs when a single DNA building block (nucleotide) called cytosine is inserted into the MUC1 gene. These insertions occur in one particular region of the gene, the part that provides instructions for the repeating mucin domain. These mutations lead to the production of an altered mucin 1 protein, although it is unclear how this change causes kidney disease. Why the effects of MUC1 gene mutations are limited to the kidneys is also unknown. "
875,MUTYH ,mutY DNA glycosylase,"The MUTYH gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called MYH glycosylase, which is involved in the repair of DNA. This enzyme corrects particular errors that are made when DNA is copied (DNA replication) in preparation for cell division. DNA is made up of building blocks called nucleotides, each of which has a specific partner. Normally, adenine pairs with thymine (written as A-T) and guanine pairs with cytosine (written as G-C). During normal cellular activities, guanine sometimes becomes altered by oxygen, which causes it to pair with adenine instead of cytosine. MYH glycosylase fixes this error so mutations do not accumulate in the DNA and lead to tumor formation. This type of repair is known as base excision repair.","Familial adenomatous polyposis Mutations in the MUTYH gene cause an autosomal recessive form of familial adenomatous polyposis (also called MYH-associated polyposis). Mutations in this gene affect the ability of cells to correct errors made during DNA replication. In individuals who have autosomal recessive familial adenomatous polyposis, both copies of the MUTYH gene in each cell are mutated. Most mutations in this gene result in the production of a nonfunctional or low-functioning MYH glycosylase. When base excision repair in the cell is impaired, mutations in other genes build up, leading to cell overgrowth and possibly tumor formation. Two mutations that change the sequence of the building blocks of proteins (amino acids) in MYH glycosylase are common in people of European descent. One mutation replaces the amino acid tyrosine with the amino acid cysteine at position 179 (written as Tyr179Cys or Y179C). The other mutation switches the amino acid glycine with the amino acid aspartic acid at position 396 (written as Gly396Asp or G396D). "
876,MVK ,mevalonate kinase,"The MVK gene provides instructions for making the mevalonate kinase enzyme. This enzyme converts a substance called mevalonic acid into mevalonate-5-phosphate. This conversion is the second step in a pathway that produces cholesterol. The cholesterol is later converted into steroid hormones and bile acids. Steroid hormones are needed for normal development and reproduction, and bile acids are used to digest fats. Mevalonate kinase also helps to produce other substances that are necessary for certain cellular functions, such as cell growth, cell maturation (differentiation), formation of the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton), gene activity (expression), and protein production and modification.","Mevalonate kinase deficiency At least 80 mutations in the MVK gene have been found to cause mevalonate kinase deficiency. There are two types of mevalonate kinase deficiency, which are differentiated by the severity of the signs and symptoms. The less severe of the two types is called hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS) and the more severe type is called mevalonic aciduria (MVA). Most of the MVK gene mutations that cause mevalonate kinase deficiency lead to changes in single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the mevalonate kinase enzyme. One mutation that replaces the amino acid valine with the amino acid isoleucine at position 337 in the enzyme (written as Val337Ile or V337I) is found in approximately 80 percent of people with HIDS. The V337I mutation has never been found in people with MVA.Most MVK gene mutations lead to the production of a mevalonate kinase enzyme that is unstable and folded into an incorrect 3-dimensional shape, leading to a reduction of mevalonate kinase enzyme activity. The severity of the enzyme shortage (deficiency) determines the severity of the condition. People who have approximately 1 to 20 percent of normal mevalonate kinase activity typically develop HIDS. Individuals who have less than 1 percent of normal enzyme activity usually develop MVA. Despite this shortage of mevalonate kinase activity, people with mevalonate kinase deficiency typically have normal production of cholesterol, steroid hormones, and bile acids.Some researchers believe the features may be due to a buildup of mevalonic acid, the substance that mevalonate kinase normally acts on. Other researchers think that a shortage of the substances produced from mevalonic acid, such as those substances necessary for certain cellular functions, causes the fever episodes and other features of this condition. The exact mechanism that causes inflammatory reactions such as fevers, skin rashes, elevated immune system proteins, and many other features of mevalonate kinase deficiency is unclear. "
877,MYBPC1 ,"myosin binding protein C, slow type","The MYBPC1 gene provides instructions for making one version of a protein called myosin binding protein C. Several versions of myosin binding protein C are produced from different genes; these proteins are found in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles) and in heart (cardiac) muscle. The version produced from the MYBPC1 gene, which is known as the slow skeletal isoform, is found primarily in skeletal muscles.The slow isoform of myosin binding protein C is active during the development of skeletal muscles. Researchers believe that this protein helps regulate the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction). Myosin binding protein C interacts with other muscle proteins, including myosin, actin, and titin. These proteins play essential roles in muscle cell structures called sarcomeres, which generate the mechanical force needed for muscles to contract. Studies suggest that myosin binding protein C contributes to the stability and maintenance of sarcomeres.","Distal arthrogryposis type 1 At least one mutation in the MYBPC1 gene has been found to cause distal arthrogryposis type 1, a disorder characterized by joint deformities (contractures) in the hands and feet. The mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the slow isoform of myosin binding protein C. Specifically, the mutation replaces the amino acid tryptophan with the amino acid arginine at protein position 236 (written as Trp236Arg or W236R). It is unclear how the defective protein leads to contractures in people with distal arthrogryposis type 1, or why the joint problems are typically limited to the hands and feet. However, researchers speculate that contractures may be related to problems with muscle contraction that limit the movement of joints before birth. "
878,MYBPC3 ,"myosin binding protein C, cardiac","The MYBPC3 gene provides instructions for making cardiac myosin binding protein C (cardiac MyBP-C), which is found in heart (cardiac) muscle cells. In these cells, cardiac MyBP-C is associated with a structure called the sarcomere, which is the basic unit of muscle contraction. Sarcomeres are made up of thick and thin filaments. The overlapping thick and thin filaments attach to each other and release, which allows the filaments to move relative to one another so that muscles can contract. Regular contractions of cardiac muscle pump blood to the rest of the body.In cardiac muscle sarcomeres, cardiac MyBP-C attaches to thick filaments and keeps them from being broken down prematurely. Cardiac MyBP-C has molecules called phosphate groups attached to it; when the phosphate groups are removed, cardiac MyBP-C is broken down, followed by the breakdown of proteins of the thick filament. Cardiac MyBP-C also regulates how fast muscles contract, although the mechanism is not fully understood.","Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Mutations in the MYBPC3 gene are a common cause of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, accounting for up to 30 percent of all cases. This condition is characterized by thickening (hypertrophy) of the cardiac muscle. Although some people with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have no obvious health effects, all affected individuals have an increased risk of heart failure and sudden death.MYBPC3 gene mutations that cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy lead to an abnormally short or otherwise altered cardiac MyBP-C protein. It is unknown how these changes cause hypertrophy of the heart muscle. "
879,MYCN ,"MYCN proto-oncogene, bHLH transcription factor","The MYCN gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in the formation of tissues and organs during development before birth. Studies in animals suggest that this protein is necessary for normal development of the limbs, heart, kidneys, lungs, nervous system, and digestive system. The MYCN protein regulates the activity of other genes by attaching (binding) to specific regions of DNA and controlling the first step of protein production (transcription). On the basis of this action, this protein is called a transcription factor.The MYCN gene belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous. The MYCN gene is a member of the Myc family of oncogenes. These genes play important roles in regulating cell growth and division (proliferation) and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).","Feingold syndrome At least 36 mutations involving the MYCN gene have been found to cause Feingold syndrome type 1. This developmental disorder is characterized by abnormalities of the fingers and toes, particularly shortening of the second and fifth fingers (brachymesophalangy). Other common features include a blockage in part of the digestive system (gastrointestinal atresia), an unusually small head size (microcephaly) and learning disabilities. Most of these mutations lead to a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the protein. In some cases of Feingold syndrome type 1, the entire MYCN gene is deleted. These genetic changes prevent one copy of the gene in each cell from producing any functional MYCN protein. As a result, only half the normal amount of this protein is available to control the activity of specific genes during development. It is unclear how a reduced amount of the MYCN protein causes the varied features of Feingold syndrome type 1. "
880,MYD88 ,"MYD88, innate immune signal transduction adaptor","The MYD88 gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in signaling within immune cells. The MyD88 protein acts as an adapter, connecting proteins that receive signals from outside the cell to the proteins that relay signals inside the cell. In particular, MyD88 transfers signals from certain proteins called Toll-like receptors and interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptors, which are important for an early immune response to foreign invaders such as bacteria. In response to signals from these receptors, the MyD88 adapter protein stimulates signaling molecules that turn on a group of interacting proteins known as nuclear factor-kappa-B. Nuclear factor-kappa-B regulates the activity of multiple genes, including genes that control the body's immune responses and inflammatory reactions. It also protects cells from certain signals that would otherwise cause them to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis).","MyD88 deficiency At least four mutations in the MYD88 gene have been found to cause a condition called MyD88 deficiency. Individuals with this condition develop recurrent bacterial infections. Unlike in Waldenström macroglobulinemia and other blood disorders (described below), the gene mutations that cause MYD88 deficiency are inherited and are found in every cell of the body (known as germline mutations). These mutations result in the production of a nonfunctional protein or no protein at all. As a result, the protein cannot relay signals that stimulate an immune response, which allows multiple severe infections to develop. "
881,MYH3 ,myosin heavy chain 3,"The MYH3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called embryonic skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain 3. This protein belongs to a group of proteins called myosins, which are involved in cell movement and transport of materials within and between cells. Thick filaments made of myosin, along with thin filaments of another protein called actin, are the primary components of muscle fibers and are important for muscle tensing (contraction).Each myosin protein complex consists of two pairs of light chains, which regulate the complex and are produced from several other genes, and two heavy chains such as that produced from the MYH3 gene. The heavy chains each have two parts: a head region and a tail region. The head region interacts with actin and includes a segment that attaches (binds) to ATP. ATP is a molecule that supplies energy for cells' activities, including muscle contraction. The long tail region of the myosin heavy chain interacts with other proteins, including the tail regions of other myosins, enabling them to form thick filaments.Embryonic skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain 3 forms part of a myosin protein complex that is normally active only before birth and is important for early development of the muscles.","Freeman-Sheldon syndrome At least 26 MYH3 gene mutations have been identified in people with Freeman-Sheldon syndrome. This disorder affects muscle and skeletal development before birth and is characterized by joint deformities (contractures) that restrict movement in the hands and feet. Researchers suggest that the MYH3 mutations that cause Freeman-Sheldon syndrome affect the way the embryonic skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain 3 protein interacts with ATP, reducing the ability of fetal muscle cells to contract. This impairment of muscle contraction may interfere with muscle development in the fetus, resulting in the contractures and other muscle and skeletal abnormalities associated with Freeman-Sheldon syndrome. It is unknown how MYH3 gene mutations relate to other features of this disorder. "
882,MYH6 ,myosin heavy chain 6,"The MYH6 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as the cardiac alpha (α)-myosin heavy chain. This protein is found in heart (cardiac) muscle cells, where it forms part of a larger protein called type II myosin. Type II myosin helps generate the mechanical force that is needed for cardiac muscle to contract, allowing the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body.Type II myosin is one of the major components of cell structures called sarcomeres. These structures are the basic units of muscle contraction. Sarcomeres are composed of thick filaments made up of type II myosin and thin filaments made up of another protein called actin. The overlapping thick and thin filaments attach to each other and release, which allows the filaments to move relative to one another so that muscles can contract. Sarcomeres also appear to have an important role in the early development of structures in the heart.","Sick sinus syndrome At least one variation of the MYH6 gene has been associated with an increased risk of developing sick sinus syndrome. This condition affects the function of the sino-atrial (SA) node, which is an area of specialized cells in the heart that functions as a natural pacemaker. The variation, which was identified in the Icelandic population, changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the α-myosin heavy chain. Specifically, it replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid tryptophan at protein position 721 (written as Arg721Trp). Researchers found that about half of the people in their sample who had the Arg721Trp variation developed sick sinus syndrome during their lifetime, compared with about 6 percent of people who did not carry the variation. They speculated that the variation may alter the structure of the α-myosin heavy chain and disrupt its usual role in cardiac muscle contraction. These changes could alter the way the heart beats in some people, leading to an abnormally slow heartbeat (bradycardia) and related symptoms such as dizziness, light-headedness, and fainting (syncope). "
883,MYH7 ,myosin heavy chain 7,"The MYH7 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as the beta (β)-myosin heavy chain. This protein is found in heart (cardiac) muscle and in type I skeletal muscle fibers. (Skeletal muscle are the muscles used for movement.) Type I fibers, which are also known as slow-twitch fibers, are one of two types of fibers that make up skeletal muscles. Type I fibers are the primary component of skeletal muscles that are resistant to fatigue. For example, muscles involved in posture, such as the neck muscles that hold the head steady, are made predominantly of type I fibers.In cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, the β-myosin heavy chain forms part of a larger protein called type II myosin. Each type II myosin protein consists of two heavy chains (produced from the MYH7 gene) and two pairs of regulatory light chains (produced from several other genes). The heavy chains each have two parts: a head region and a tail region. The head region, called the motor domain, interacts with a protein called actin, which is important for cell movement and shape. The long tail region interacts with other proteins, including the tail regions of other myosin proteins.Type II myosin generates the mechanical force that is needed for muscles to contract. It is integral to muscle cell structures called sarcomeres, which are the basic units of muscle contraction. Sarcomeres are composed of thick filaments made up of type II myosin and thin filaments made up of actin. The overlapping thick and thin filaments attach to each other and release, which allows the filaments to move relative to one another so that muscles can contract. In the heart, regular contractions of cardiac muscle pump blood to the rest of the body. The coordinated contraction and relaxation of skeletal muscles allow the body to move.","Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Mutations in the MYH7 gene are a common cause of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, accounting for up to 35 percent of all cases. This condition is characterized by thickening (hypertrophy) of the cardiac muscle. Although some people with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have no obvious health effects, all affected individuals have an increased risk of heart failure and sudden death.Most MYH7 gene mutations that cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the β-myosin heavy chain protein. The altered protein is likely incorporated into the thick filament, but it may not function properly. It is unclear how MYH7 gene mutations lead to the features of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. "
884,MYH9 ,myosin heavy chain 9,"The MYH9 gene provides instructions for making a protein called myosin-9. This protein is one part (subunit) of the myosin IIA protein.There are three forms of myosin II, called myosin IIA, myosin IIB and myosin IIC. They play roles in cell movement (cell motility); maintenance of cell shape; and cytokinesis, which is the step in cell division when the fluid surrounding the nucleus (the cytoplasm) divides to form two separate cells. While some cells use more than one type of myosin II, certain blood cells such as platelets and white blood cells (leukocytes) use only myosin IIA.Each type of myosin II protein consists of two heavy chains and four light chains. The heavy chains each have two parts: a head region and a tail region. The head region interacts with actin, a protein that is important for cell movement and shape. The long tail region interacts with other proteins, including the tail regions of other myosin proteins.","MYH9-related disorder More than 45 mutations in the MYH9 gene have been found to cause MYH9-related disorder. This disorder is characterized by bleeding problems, hearing loss, kidney (renal) disease, and clouding of the lens of the eyes (cataracts). Most of the mutations that cause this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the myosin-9 protein. Mutations that are located near the head of the myosin protein tend to lead to a more severe disorder than mutations that are located toward the tail of the protein. Recurring mutations involving the amino acid arginine at position 702 in the protein tend to result in many problems, including a severely reduced amount of platelets (thrombocytopenia), early-onset renal disease, and hearing loss in infancy.Mutations in the MYH9 gene lead to the production of a nonfunctional protein. A nonfunctional myosin-9 protein cannot properly interact with other subunits to form myosin IIA. Platelets, which only express myosin IIA, are most affected by a lack of functional myosin-9, accounting for the thrombocytopenia seen in all individuals with MYH9-related disorder. "
885,MYH11 ,myosin heavy chain 11,"The MYH11 gene provides instructions for making a protein called smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 11. It belongs to a group of proteins called myosins, which are involved in cell movement and the transport of materials within and between cells. Thick filaments made of myosin, along with thin filaments of another protein called actin, are the primary components of muscle fibers and are important for muscle tensing (contraction). Smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 11 forms part of a myosin protein complex found in smooth muscles. Smooth muscles are the muscles that line the internal organs of the body, including the blood vessels, stomach, and intestines; as part of their normal function in the body, these muscles contract and relax involuntarily.Each myosin protein complex consists of two pairs of light chains, which regulate the complex and are produced from several other genes, and two heavy chains such as that produced from the MYH11 gene. The heavy chains each have two parts: a head region and a tail region. The head region interacts with actin and includes a segment that attaches (binds) to ATP. ATP is a molecule that supplies energy for the cells' activities, including muscle contraction. The long tail region of the myosin heavy chain interacts with other proteins, including the tail regions of other myosins, enabling them to form thick filaments.","Core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia Rearrangements of genetic material involving the MYH11 gene are involved in a form of blood cancer known as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The most common of these rearrangements is an inversion of a region of chromosome 16 (written as inv(16)). An inversion involves breakage of the chromosome in two places; the resulting piece of DNA is reversed and reinserted into the chromosome. Less commonly, a rearrangement known as a translocation occurs between the two copies of chromosome 16 (written as t(16;16)). In this translocation, pieces of DNA from each copy of the chromosome break off and are interchanged. Both types of genetic rearrangement result in the fusion of two genes found on chromosome 16, CBFB and MYH11. These rearrangements are associated with 5 to 8 percent of AML cases in adults. AML associated with either inv(16) or t(16;16) is classified as core binding factor AML (CBF-AML).The protein produced from the normal CBFB gene interacts with another protein called RUNX1 to form a complex called core binding factor (CBF). This complex attaches to specific areas of DNA and turns on genes that are involved in the development of blood cells. The protein produced from the fusion gene, CBFβ-MYH11, can still bind to RUNX1; however, the function of CBF is impaired. The presence of CBFβ-MYH11 may block binding of CBF to DNA, impairing its ability to control gene activity. Alternatively, the MYH11 portion of the fusion protein may interact with other proteins that prevent the complex from controlling gene activity. This change in gene activity blocks the maturation (differentiation) of blood cells and leads to the production of abnormal, immature white blood cells called myeloid blasts. While inv(16) and t(16;16) are important for leukemia development, one or more additional genetic changes are typically needed for the myeloid blasts to develop into cancerous leukemia cells. "
886,MYO5A ,myosin VA,"The MYO5A gene provides instructions for making a protein called myosin Va, which is part of a group of proteins called unconventional myosins. These proteins, which have similar structures, each play a role in transporting molecules within cells. Myosins interact with actin, a protein that is important for cell movement and shape. Researchers believe that myosins use long filaments of actin as tracks along which to transport other molecules.Myosin Va is found in pigment-producing cells called melanocytes, where it helps transport structures called melanosomes. These structures produce a pigment called melanin, which is the substance that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color (pigmentation). Myosin Va interacts with proteins produced from the MLPH and RAB27A genes to form a complex that transports melanosomes to the outer edges of melanocytes. From there, the melanosomes are transferred to other types of cells, where they provide the pigment needed for normal hair, skin, and eye coloring.Myosin Va also plays an important role in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. Studies suggest that myosin Va transports various proteins and other molecules within neurons. It is also involved in the release of certain substances from these cells (exocytosis). The movement of these materials appears to be critical for normal brain function.","Griscelli syndrome At least two mutations in the MYO5A gene have been found in people with Griscelli syndrome. These mutations cause a form of the condition designated type 1, which is characterized by unusually light (hypopigmented) skin, silvery-gray hair, and neurological abnormalities resulting in delayed development, intellectual disability, and seizures. The known MYO5A gene mutations prevent the production of functional myosin Va. Because the nonfunctional protein cannot form a complex with the proteins made from the MLPH and RAB27A genes, melanosomes cannot be transported to the edges of melanocytes. Instead, these structures clump near the center of melanocytes, trapping melanin within these cells and preventing normal pigmentation of skin and hair. A loss of myosin Va in neurons disrupts the transport of proteins and other molecules within and out of these cells, which likely causes the neurological problems found in Griscelli syndrome type 1. "
887,MYO5B ,myosin VB,"The MYO5B gene provides instructions for making a protein called myosin Vb. This protein is one of a group of proteins with similar structures called myosins, which are involved in cell movement and the transport of materials within and between cells. Myosin Vb helps to determine the position of various components within cells (cell polarity). Myosin Vb also plays a role in moving components from the cell membrane to the interior of the cell for recycling.","Microvillus inclusion disease More than 40 mutations in the MYO5B gene have been found to cause microvillus inclusion disease. This condition is characterized by chronic, life-threatening diarrhea beginning in infancy. The MYO5B gene mutations that cause this condition result in a decrease or absence of myosin Vb function. In cells that line the small intestine (enterocytes), a lack of myosin Vb function changes the cell polarity. As a result, enterocytes cannot properly form structures called microvilli, which normally project like small fingers from the surface of the cells and absorb nutrients and fluids from food as it passes through the intestine. Inside affected enterocytes, small clumps of abnormal microvilli mix with misplaced digestive proteins to form microvillus inclusions, which contribute to the dysfunction of enterocytes. Disorganized enterocytes with poorly formed microvilli reduce the intestine's ability to take in nutrients and fluids. The inability to absorb nutrients and fluids during digestion leads to severe diarrhea, malnutrition, and dehydration in individuals with microvillus inclusion disease. "
888,MYO7A ,myosin VIIA,"The MYO7A gene provides instructions for making a protein called myosin VIIA, which is part of a group of proteins called unconventional myosins. These proteins, which have similar structures, help transport molecules within cells. Myosins interact with actin, a protein that is important for cell movement and shape. Researchers believe that myosins use long filaments of actin as tracks along which to transport other molecules.Myosin VIIA is made in the inner ear and in the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. In the inner ear, myosin VIIA plays a role in the development and maintenance of hairlike projections called stereocilia. Stereocilia, which are rich in actin, line the inner ear and bend in response to sound waves. This bending motion is critical for converting sound waves to nerve impulses, which are then transmitted to the brain. Stereocilia are also elements of the vestibular system, the part of the inner ear that helps maintain the body's balance and orientation in space. Bending of these stereocilia is needed to transmit signals from the vestibular system to the brain.In the retina, myosin VIIA is found primarily in a thin layer of cells called the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Myosin VIIA probably plays a role in the development and maintenance of this tissue, which supports and nourishes the retina. Research suggests that one function of myosin VIIA is to carry small sacs of pigment (called melanosomes) within the RPE. This pigment is necessary for normal vision. Myosin VIIA is also found in other parts of the retina, where it likely carries additional proteins and molecules that are important for vision.","Nonsyndromic hearing loss Researchers have identified several MYO7A gene mutations that can cause nonsyndromic hearing loss, which is loss of hearing that is not associated with other signs and symptoms. Mutations in this gene are thought to cause two forms of nonsyndromic hearing loss: DFNA11 and DFNB2.DFNA11 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means only one mutated copy of the MYO7A gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. This form of hearing loss begins in childhood, after a child learns to speak (postlingual), and becomes more severe over time.Most of the mutations that cause DFNA11 alter a single protein building block (amino acid) in myosin VIIA, resulting in an abnormal protein that does not work properly. Other genetic changes delete a small amount of DNA from critical regions of the MYO7A gene, which probably changes the structure of the protein. Researchers suspect that the altered protein causes hearing loss by disrupting the growth and organization of stereocilia in the inner ear.DFNB2 is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the MYO7A gene are mutated in each cell. The hearing loss can be postlingual or begin before a child learns to speak (prelingual). Some researchers have suggested that individuals with DFNB2 may actually have Usher syndrome (described below), because some individuals who were thought to have nonsyndromic hearing loss developed retinitis pigmentosa (a vision disorder characteristic of Usher syndrome) later in life. However, other individuals diagnosed with DFNB2 never develop retinitis pigmentosa, and recent studies indicate that DFNB2 and Usher syndrome probably result from different mutations in the MYO7A gene.The mutations that cause DFNB2 alter the structure and function of myosin VIIA, but they probably do not eliminate the protein's function completely. Recent studies found that the protein likely retains enough function in the retina to allow for normal vision, but not enough function in the inner ear to permit normal hearing. "
889,MYOC ,myocilin,"The MYOC gene provides instructions for producing a protein called myocilin. Myocilin is found in certain structures of the eye, called the trabecular meshwork and the ciliary body, that regulate the pressure within the eye (intraocular pressure). It is also found in various types of muscle. Myocilin's function is not well understood, but it may help to control the intraocular pressure through its action in the muscle tissue of the ciliary body.Researchers believe that myocilin functions together with other proteins as part of a protein complex. Myocilin may interact with a number of other proteins including a form of the cytochrome P450 protein, the product of the CYP1B1 gene. Like myocilin, this protein is found in the trabecular meshwork, ciliary body, and other structures of the eye.","Early-onset glaucoma Approximately 10 percent to 33 percent of people with juvenile open-angle glaucoma have mutations in the MYOC gene. MYOC gene mutations have also been detected in some people with primary congenital glaucoma. More than 40 MYOC gene mutations have been identified.Mutations in the MYOC gene may alter the myocilin protein so that its interactions with other proteins are impeded. Defective myocilin that is not incorporated into protein complexes may accumulate in the trabecular meshwork and ciliary body. The excess protein may prevent sufficient flow of fluid from the eye, resulting in increased intraocular pressure and causing the signs and symptoms of early-onset glaucoma.Individuals with mutations in both the MYOC and CYP1B1 genes may develop glaucoma at an earlier age than do those with mutations in only one of the genes. "
890,MYOT ,myotilin,"The MYOT gene provides instructions for making a protein called myotilin. Myotilin is found in heart (cardiac) muscle and muscles used for movement (skeletal muscle). Within muscle fibers, myotilin proteins are found in structures called sarcomeres, which are necessary for muscles to tense (contract). Myotilin attaches (binds) to other proteins to help form sarcomeres. Myotilin is also involved in linking neighboring sarcomeres to each another to form myofibrils, the basic unit of muscle fibers. The connection of sarcomeres to each other and the formation of myofibrils are essential for maintaining muscle fiber strength during repeated cycles of contraction and relaxation.","Myofibrillar myopathy At least five mutations in the MYOT gene have been found to cause myofibrillar myopathy. Most of these mutations are located in an area of the gene known as exon 2. MYOT gene mutations that cause myofibrillar myopathy change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in myotilin. Mutated myotilin proteins cluster together with other muscle proteins in the sarcomere to form clumps (aggregates). The aggregates prevent these proteins from functioning normally. A dysfunctional myotilin protein cannot properly bind with other proteins, preventing the formation of sarcomeres and myofibrils. MYOT gene mutations that cause myofibrillar myopathy impair the function of muscle fibers, causing weakness and the other features of this condition. "
891,NAGA ,alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase,"The NAGA gene provides instructions for making the enzyme alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. This enzyme works in the lysosomes, which are compartments within cells that digest and recycle materials. Within lysosomes, the enzyme helps break down complexes called glycoproteins and glycolipids, which consist of sugar molecules attached to certain proteins and fats. Specifically, alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase helps remove a molecule called alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine from sugars in these complexes.","Schindler disease Approximately seven NAGA gene mutations have been identified in people with Schindler disease. Most of these mutations are believed to change the 3-dimensional shape of the alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase enzyme, interfering with its ability to break down glycoproteins and glycolipids. These substances accumulate in the lysosomes and cause cells to malfunction and eventually die. Cell damage in the various tissues and organs of the body leads to neurological problems and the other signs and symptoms of Schindler disease. "
892,NAGLU ,N-acetyl-alpha-glucosaminidase,"The NAGLU gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase. This enzyme is located in lysosomes, compartments within cells that digest and recycle different types of molecules. Alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase is involved in the step-wise breakdown of large molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are composed of sugar molecules that are linked together to form a long string. To break down these large molecules, individual sugars are removed one at a time from one end of the molecule. Alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase removes a sugar called N-acetylglucosamine when it is at the end of the GAG chain.","Mucopolysaccharidosis type III At least 118 mutations in the NAGLU gene have been found to cause mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS IIIB). Most of these mutations change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the gene. All of the mutations that cause MPS IIIB reduce or eliminate the function of alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase.The lack of alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity disrupts the breakdown of a subset of GAGs called heparan sulfate. As a result, partially broken down heparan sulfate accumulates within lysosomes. Researchers believe that the accumulation of GAGs interferes with the functions of other proteins inside the lysosomes and disrupts the normal functions of cells. It is unknown why the buildup of heparan sulfate mostly affects the central nervous system in MPS IIIB. "
893,NAGS ,N-acetylglutamate synthase,"The NAGS gene provides instructions for making the enzyme N-acetylglutamate synthase. This enzyme is needed for the urea cycle, a series of reactions that occurs in liver cells. The urea cycle breaks down excess nitrogen, which is made when protein is used by the body, into a compound called urea. Urea is removed from the body in urine. Removing the excess nitrogen prevents it from accumulating in the form of ammonia, which is toxic at high levels, especially to the brain.N-acetylglutamate synthase controls the production of a compound called N-acetylglutamate in the mitochondria, the energy-producing centers in cells. N-acetylglutamate is necessary to turn on the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I. This enzyme controls the first step of the urea cycle, in which excess nitrogen compounds are incorporated into the cycle to be broken down.","N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency More than 40 NAGS gene mutations have been identified in people with N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency, which is characterized by abnormally high levels of ammonia in the blood. This condition can cause extreme tiredness (lethargy), difficulty feeding, problems controlling breathing or body temperature, and seizures in infancy. Affected adults can have episodes of vomiting, confusion, headaches, or other neurological problems.Most NAGS gene mutations that cause N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the N-acetylglutamate synthase enzyme. It is thought that the abnormal enzyme cannot function properly. Other mutations result in production of an abnormally short N-acetylglutamate synthase enzyme or prevent any enzyme from being produced at all.When the function of the N-acetylglutamate synthase enzyme is reduced or eliminated, N-acetylglutamate is produced in lower-than-normal amounts, or not at all. This shortage of N-acetylglutamate prevents carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I from being turned on, which prevents the urea cycle from starting. As a result, excess nitrogen is not converted to urea for removal, and ammonia accumulates in the blood. The buildup of ammonia damages tissues in the brain and causes the neurological problems and other signs and symptoms of N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency. "
894,NBEAL2 ,neurobeachin like 2,"The NBEAL2 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unclear. The protein appears to be critical for the normal development of platelets, which are small blood cells involved in blood clotting.Platelets are produced in bone marrow, the spongy tissue in the center of long bones that produces most of the blood cells the body needs. Platelets are formed from large precursor cells known as megakaryocytes. Within these cells, the NBEAL2 protein is thought to play a role in the development of sacs called alpha-granules, which are the most abundant components of platelets. Alpha-granules contain growth factors and other proteins that are important for blood clotting and wound healing. In response to an injury that causes bleeding, the proteins stored in alpha-granules help platelets stick to one another to form a plug that seals off damaged blood vessels and prevents further blood loss.","Gray platelet syndrome At least 35 mutations in the NBEAL2 gene have been found to cause gray platelet syndrome, a disorder associated with abnormal bleeding. Most people with gray platelet syndrome also develop a condition called myelofibrosis, which is characterized by the buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis) in the bone marrow that prevents it from making enough normal blood cells.Mutations in the NBEAL2 gene disrupt the normal production of alpha-granules in megakaryocytes. Without alpha-granules, platelets are abnormally large and fewer in number than usual (macrothrombocytopenia). The abnormal platelets also appear gray when viewed under a microscope, which gives this condition its name. A lack of alpha-granules impairs the clumping of platelets in response to injury, increasing the risk of abnormal bleeding. Myelofibrosis is thought to occur because the growth factors and other proteins that are normally packaged into alpha-granules leak out into the bone marrow. The proteins lead to fibrosis that affects the bone marrow's ability to make new blood cells. "
895,NBN ,nibrin,"The NBN gene provides instructions for making a protein called nibrin. This protein is involved in several critical cellular functions, including the repair of damaged DNA.Nibrin interacts with two other proteins, produced from the MRE11A and RAD50 genes, as part of a larger protein complex. Nibrin regulates the activity of this complex by carrying the MRE11A and RAD50 proteins into the cell's nucleus and guiding them to sites of DNA damage. The proteins work together to mend broken strands of DNA. DNA can be damaged by agents such as toxic chemicals or radiation, and breaks in DNA strands also occur naturally when chromosomes exchange genetic material in preparation for cell division. Repairing DNA prevents cells from accumulating genetic damage that may cause them to die or to divide uncontrollably.The MRE11A/RAD50/NBN complex interacts with the protein produced from the ATM gene, which plays an essential role in recognizing broken strands of DNA and coordinating their repair. The MRE11A/RAD50/NBN complex helps maintain the stability of a cell's genetic information through its roles in repairing damaged DNA and regulating cell division. Because these functions are critical for preventing the formation of cancerous tumors, nibrin is described as a tumor suppressor.","Nijmegen breakage syndrome At least 10 mutations in the NBN gene have been found to cause Nijmegen breakage syndrome, a condition characterized by slow growth, recurrent infections, and an increased risk of developing cancer. The NBN gene mutations that cause Nijmegen breakage syndrome typically lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the nibrin protein. The mutation found in most affected individuals, particularly in Slavic populations of Eastern Europe, deletes five DNA building blocks (nucleotides) from the NBN gene (written as 657_661del5). This mutation leads to the production of a shortened version of the nibrin protein called p70-nibrin. This shortened protein is not as effective as normal nibrin in responding to DNA damage, but p70-nibrin does appear to have some residual function.When breaks in DNA are not repaired properly, genetic damage can accumulate. A buildup of errors in DNA can trigger cells to grow and divide abnormally, increasing the risk of cancer in people with Nijmegen breakage syndrome. Nibrin's role in regulating cell division and cell growth (proliferation) is thought to lead to the problems with the immune system that are seen in affected individuals. A lack of functional nibrin results in less immune cell proliferation. A decrease in the amount of immune cells that are produced leads to a malfunctioning immune system. It is unclear how mutations in the NBN gene cause the other features of Nijmegen breakage syndrome. "
896,NCF1 ,neutrophil cytosolic factor 1,"The NCF1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 (also known as p47-phox). This protein is one part (subunit) of a group of proteins that forms an enzyme complex called NADPH oxidase, which plays an essential role in the immune system. NADPH oxidase is primarily active in immune system cells called phagocytes. These cells catch and destroy foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi. NADPH oxidase is also thought to regulate the activity of immune cells called neutrophils. These cells play a role in adjusting the inflammatory response to optimize healing and reduce injury to the body.The presence of foreign invaders stimulates phagocytes and triggers the assembly of NADPH oxidase. This enzyme participates in a chemical reaction that converts oxygen to a toxic molecule called superoxide. Superoxide is used to generate several other compounds, including hydrogen peroxide (a strong disinfectant) and hypochlorous acid (the active ingredient in bleach). These highly reactive, toxic substances are known as reactive oxygen species. Phagocytes use these substances to kill foreign invaders, preventing them from reproducing in the body and causing illness.","Chronic granulomatous disease Mutations in the NCF1 gene account for about 25 percent of cases of chronic granulomatous disease. People with this disorder are at increased risk of developing recurrent episodes of infection and inflammation due to a weakened immune system. The mutations that cause this disorder occur in both copies of the NCF1 gene in each cell. Ninety-five percent of affected individuals have a mutation known as delta GT that deletes two DNA building blocks from the NCF1 gene in an area called exon 2 (written as 75_76delGT). This genetic change leads to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of neutrophil cytosolic factor 1. Other, less common mutations also disrupt the function or production of neutrophil cytosolic factor 1. Without this protein, NADPH oxidase cannot assemble or function properly. As a result, phagocytes are unable to produce reactive oxygen species to kill foreign invaders and neutrophil activity is not regulated. A lack of NADPH oxidase leaves affected individuals vulnerable to many types of infection and excessive inflammation. "
897,NCF2 ,neutrophil cytosolic factor 2,"The NCF2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called neutrophil cytosolic factor 2 (also known as p67-phox). This protein is one part (subunit) of a group of proteins that forms an enzyme complex called NADPH oxidase, which plays an essential role in the immune system. Specifically, NADPH oxidase is primarily active in immune system cells called phagocytes. These cells catch and destroy foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi. NADPH oxidase is also thought to regulate the activity of immune cells called neutrophils. These cells play a role in adjusting the inflammatory response to optimize healing and reduce injury to the body.The presence of foreign invaders stimulates phagocytes and triggers the assembly of NADPH oxidase.

Superoxide is used to generate several other compounds, including hydrogen peroxide (a strong disinfectant) and hypochlorous acid (the active ingredient in bleach). These highly reactive, toxic substances are known as reactive oxygen species. Phagocytes use these substances to kill foreign invaders, preventing them from reproducing in the body and causing illness.","Chronic granulomatous disease More than 50 mutations in the NCF2 gene have been found to cause chronic granulomatous disease. People with this disorder are at increased risk of developing recurrent episodes of infection and inflammation due to a weakened immune system. Mutations in the NCF2 gene cause less than 5 percent of all cases of this condition. These mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the neutrophil cytosolic factor 2 protein, which cause the protein to be abnormally short and nonfunctional or alter its 3-dimensional structure. All of these mutations decrease the function of the neutrophil cytosolic factor 2 protein or prevent its production. Without this protein, NADPH oxidase cannot assemble or function properly. As a result, phagocytes are unable to produce reactive oxygen species to kill foreign invaders and neutrophil activity is not regulated. A lack of NADPH oxidase leaves affected individuals vulnerable to many types of infection and excessive inflammation. "
898,NCF4 ,neutrophil cytosolic factor 4,"The NCF4 gene provides instructions for making a protein called neutrophil cytosolic factor 4 (also known as p40-phox). This protein is one part (subunit) of a group of proteins that forms an enzyme complex called NADPH oxidase, which plays an essential role in the immune system. Specifically, NADPH oxidase is primarily active in immune system cells called phagocytes. These cells catch and destroy foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi. NADPH oxidase is also thought to regulate the activity of immune cells called neutrophils. These cells play a role in adjusting the inflammatory response to optimize healing and reduce injury to the body.The presence of foreign invaders stimulates phagocytes and triggers the assembly of NADPH oxidase.

These highly reactive, toxic substances are known as reactive oxygen species. Phagocytes use these substances to kill foreign invaders, preventing them from reproducing in the body and causing illness.","Chronic granulomatous disease At least two mutations in the NCF4 gene have been found to cause chronic granulomatous disease. People with this disorder are at increased risk of developing recurrent episodes of infection and inflammation due to a weakened immune system. Mutations in the NCF4 gene are a rare cause of this condition. These mutations result in a decrease in functional NADPH oxidase. A shortage (deficiency) of this protein impairs the assembly or function of NADPH oxidase. As a result, phagocytes are unable to produce reactive oxygen species to kill foreign invaders, and neutrophil activity is not regulated. A lack of NADPH oxidase leaves affected individuals vulnerable to many types of infection and excessive inflammation. "
899,NCSTN ,nicastrin,"The NCSTN gene provides instructions for making a protein called nicastrin. This protein is one part (subunit) of a complex called gamma- (γ-) secretase. Nicastrin plays a critical role in the assembly and stability of this complex.The γ-secretase complex is located in the membrane that surrounds cells, where it cuts apart (cleaves) many different proteins that span the cell membrane (transmembrane proteins). This cleavage is an important step in several chemical signaling pathways that transmit signals from outside the cell into the nucleus. One of these pathways, known as Notch signaling, is essential for the normal maturation and division of hair follicle cells and other types of skin cells. Notch signaling is also involved in normal immune system function.","Hidradenitis suppurativa At least 11 mutations in the NCSTN gene have been found to cause hidradenitis suppurativa, a chronic skin disease characterized by recurrent boil-like lumps (nodules) under the skin that develop in hair follicles. The nodules tend to become inflamed and painful, and they produce significant scarring as they heal.NCSTN gene mutations reduce the amount of functional nicastrin produced in cells, so less of this protein is available to act as part of the γ-secretase complex. The resulting shortage of normal γ-secretase impairs cell signaling pathways, including Notch signaling. Although little is known about the mechanism, studies suggest that abnormal Notch signaling may promote the development of recurrent nodules in hair follicles and trigger inflammation in the skin. "
900,NDP ,"NDP, norrin cystine knot growth factor","The NDP gene provides instructions for making a protein called norrin. Norrin participates in chemical signaling pathways that affect the way cells and tissues develop. Studies suggest that norrin may play a role in Wnt signaling, which is important for cell division (proliferation), attachment of cells to one another (adhesion), cell movement (migration), and many other cellular activities.Norrin is one of many proteins, or ligands, that can attach (bind) to other proteins called frizzled receptors. These receptors are embedded in the outer membranes of cells. Norrin binds with the receptor frizzled-4 (produced from the FZD4 gene), fitting together like a key in a lock. When a ligand binds to a frizzled receptor, it initiates a multi-step process that regulates the activity of certain genes.The norrin protein and its receptor frizzled-4 participate in developmental processes that are believed to be crucial for normal development of the eye and other body systems. In particular, norrin seems to play critical roles in the specialization of cells in the retina (the thin layer at the back of the eye that senses light and color) and the establishment of a blood supply to the retina and the inner ear.","Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy Several NDP gene mutations have been found to cause the eye disorder familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. These mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the norrin protein, altering the normal folding of norrin or preventing it from binding to frizzled-4. The defective norrin disrupts chemical signaling in the developing eye, which interferes with the formation of blood vessels at the edges of the retina. The resulting abnormal blood supply to this tissue leads to retinal damage and vision loss in some people with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. "
901,NEB ,nebulin,"The NEB gene provides instructions for making a protein called nebulin. This protein plays an important role in skeletal muscles, which are muscles used for movement. Within skeletal muscle cells, nebulin is found in structures called sarcomeres. Sarcomeres are necessary for muscles to tense (contract). Nebulin is one of several proteins that interact to generate the mechanical force needed for muscle contraction.",Nemaline myopathy More than 60 mutations in the NEB gene have been found to cause nemaline myopathy. Some of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the nebulin protein or result in the production of an abnormally short protein. Other mutations insert or delete genetic material in the NEB gene. Most NEB gene mutations alter the structure or reduce the production of nebulin. A lack of functional nebulin impairs the muscle cells' ability to contract. Inefficient muscle contraction leads to muscle weakness and the other features of nemaline myopathy. 
902,NEU1 ,neuraminidase 1,"The NEU1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called neuraminidase 1 (NEU1), which is found in lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments within cells that use enzymes to digest and recycle materials. The NEU1 enzyme helps break down large sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) attached to certain proteins (glycoproteins) by removing an substance known as sialic acid.","Sialidosis At least 42 mutations in the NEU1 gene have been found to cause sialidosis. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make the NEU1 enzyme. Mutations in the NEU1 gene lead to a shortage (deficiency) of the NEU1 enzyme. When this enzyme is lacking, large molecules that are usually broken down by the NEU1 enzyme accumulate inside lysosomes. Conditions such as sialidosis that cause large molecules to build up inside lysosomes are called lysosomal storage disorders. Mutations that eliminate NEU1 enzyme activity cause more severe signs and symptoms than those that result in some functional enzyme. It is unclear exactly how the accumulation of large molecules within lysosomes leads to the signs and symptoms of sialidosis. "
903,NF1 ,neurofibromin 1,"The NF1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called neurofibromin. This protein is produced in many types of cells, including nerve cells and specialized cells called oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells that surround nerves. These specialized cells form myelin sheaths, which are the fatty coverings that insulate and protect certain nerve cells.Neurofibromin acts as a tumor suppressor protein. Tumor suppressors normally prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. This protein appears to prevent cell overgrowth by turning off another protein (called ras) that stimulates cell growth and division. Other potential functions for neurofibromin are under investigation.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 More than 1,000 NF1 mutations that cause neurofibromatosis type 1 have been identified. Most of these mutations are unique to a particular family. Many NF1 mutations result in the production of an extremely short version of neurofibromin. This shortened protein cannot perform its normal job of inhibiting cell division. When mutations occur in both copies of the NF1 gene in Schwann cells, the resulting loss of neurofibromin allows noncancerous tumors called neurofibromas to form. Research indicates that the formation of neurofibromas requires the interaction of Schwann cells with other cells, including mast cells. Mast cells are normally involved in wound healing and tissue repair. "
904,NF2 ,neurofibromin 2,"The NF2 gene provides instructions for the production of a protein called merlin, also known as schwannomin. This protein is made in the nervous system, particularly in specialized cells called Schwann cells that wrap around and insulate nerves.Merlin helps regulate several key signaling pathways that are important for controlling cell shape, cell growth, and the attachment of cells to one another (cell adhesion). This protein functions as a tumor suppressor, preventing cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way.","Neurofibromatosis type 2 More than 400 mutations in the NF2 gene have been identified in people with neurofibromatosis type 2, a disorder characterized by the growth of noncancerous (benign) tumors in the nervous system. The most common tumors associated with this condition are bilateral vestibular schwannomas, which develop along the nerves that carry information from the inner ear to the brain (the auditory nerves). These tumors arise from Schwann cells. People with neurofibromatosis type 2 can also develop other nervous system tumors, including meningiomas and ependymomas.The NF2 gene mutations that cause neurofibromatosis type 2 are classified as germline, which means they are present in all of the body's cells. Most NF2 gene mutations result in an abnormally shortened version of the merlin protein. This short protein cannot perform its normal tumor suppressor function in cells. Research suggests that the loss of merlin's function allows certain cells in the nervous system, especially Schwann cells, to multiply too frequently and form tumors. "
905,NFKBIA ,NFKB inhibitor alpha,"The NFKBIA gene provides instructions for making one piece (the alpha subunit) of the IKK protein complex, which is a group of related proteins that regulates the activity of nuclear factor-kappa-B. Nuclear factor-kappa-B is a protein complex that binds to DNA and controls the activity of other genes. When it is turned off (inactive), nuclear factor-kappa-B is attached (bound) to the IKK complex. In response to certain signals, the IKK complex turns on (activates) nuclear factor-kappa-B and releases it.The NFKBIA protein helps keep nuclear factor-kappa-B bound in the IKK complex. When the NFKBIA protein receives a signal that nuclear factor-kappa-B is to be released, it breaks down so the factor can be turned on (activated) and released from the complex. Once the active factor is released, it moves into the nucleus and binds to DNA. Nuclear factor-kappa-B regulates the activity of multiple genes, including genes that control the body's immune responses and inflammatory reactions. Nuclear factor-kappa-B also appears to play a role in the signaling pathway that is critical for the formation of ectodermal tissues including the skin, hair, teeth, and sweat glands. In addition, it protects the cell from certain signals that would otherwise cause it to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis).","Anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency At least five mutations in the NFKBIA gene have been found to cause anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency (EDA-ID). EDA-ID is a condition characterized by reduced function of the immune system, resulting in recurrent infections, and abnormal development of ectodermal tissues. The NFKBIA gene mutations that cause EDA-ID impair the protein's breakdown. As a result, nuclear factor-kappa-B is not activated or released from the IKK complex. Without nuclear factor-kappa-B available in the nucleus to regulate gene activity, certain signaling pathways within immune cells and cells that form ectodermal tissues are disrupted, resulting in immune deficiency and incomplete development of tissues of the ectoderm as occurs in individuals with EDA-ID. "
906,NFU1 ,NFU1 iron-sulfur cluster scaffold,"The NFU1 gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in the formation of molecules called iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters. These clusters are attached to certain other proteins and are required for their proper function.Two versions (isoforms) of the NFU-1 protein are produced from the NFU1 gene. One version is found in cellular structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria are the energy-producing centers of cells. In these structures, several proteins carry out a series of chemical steps to convert the energy in food into a form that cells can use. Many of the proteins involved in this process require Fe-S clusters to function, including protein complexes called complex I, complex II, and complex III.Fe-S clusters are also required for another mitochondrial protein to function; this protein is involved in the modification of additional proteins that aid in energy production in mitochondria, including the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. This modification is also critical to the function of the glycine cleavage system, a set of proteins that breaks down a protein building block (amino acid) called glycine when levels become too high.The other version of the NFU-1 protein is found in the fluid-filled space inside the cell (the cytoplasm). While this protein is likely involved in Fe-S cluster formation in the cytoplasm, the role of this isoform is not well understood.","Multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome Mutations in the NFU1 gene can cause multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome. This severe condition is characterized by impairment of more than one mitochondrial function, such as reduced activity of complex I, II, or III, pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, or the glycine cleavage system. Affected infants often have severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy) and elevated levels of a chemical called lactic acid in the body (lactic acidosis). These babies usually do not survive past infancy.NFU1 gene mutations lead to production of an altered NFU-1 protein that is likely broken down quickly. Although some mutations affect both isoforms of the NFU-1 protein, loss of the mitochondrial version appears to be responsible for the condition. The lack of mitochondrial NFU-1 protein impairs Fe-S cluster formation. Consequently, proteins affected by the presence of Fe-S clusters, including those involved in energy production and glycine breakdown, cannot function normally. Reduced activity of complex I, II, or III, pyruvate dehydrogenase, or alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase leads to potentially fatal lactic acidosis, encephalopathy, and other signs and symptoms of multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome. In some affected individuals, impairment of the glycine cleavage system leads to a buildup of glycine (hyperglycinemia). "
907,NGF ,nerve growth factor,"The NGF gene provides instructions for making a protein called nerve growth factor beta (NGFβ). This protein is important in the development and survival of nerve cells (neurons), especially those that transmit pain, temperature, and touch sensations (sensory neurons). The NGFβ protein functions by attaching (binding) to its receptors, which initiates signaling pathways inside the cell. The NGFβ protein can bind to two different receptors, the NTRK1 receptor or the p75NTR receptor. Both receptors are found on the surface of sensory neurons and other types of neurons. The binding of the NGFβ protein to the NTRK1 receptor signals these neurons to grow and to mature and take on specialized functions (differentiate). This binding also blocks signals that initiate the process of self-destruction (apoptosis). Additionally, NGFβ signaling through NTRK1 plays a role in pain sensation. It is less clear what binding with the p75NTR receptor signals. Studies suggest that p75NTR signaling can help sensory neurons grow and differentiate but can also trigger apoptosis.","Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type V At least one mutation in the NGF gene has been reported to cause hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type V (HSAN5), a condition characterized by the inability to feel pain and sense hot and cold. This mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the NGFβ protein. The amino acid arginine is replaced with the amino acid tryptophan at position 100 (written as Arg100Trp or R100W). Studies show that the mutated NGFβ protein cannot bind to the p75NTR receptor and that it alters the signaling through the NTRK1 receptor. In addition, people with HSAN5 have a reduced number of sensory neurons. However, the mechanism by which mutation of the NGF gene leads to the inability to feel pain and temperature sensations is unclear. Although the NGFβ protein is important in many types of neurons, only sensory neurons appear to be affected in people with HSAN5. "
908,NGLY1 ,N-glycanase 1,"The NGLY1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called N-glycanase 1. This enzyme is involved in a process called deglycosylation, by which chains of sugar molecules (glycans) are removed from proteins. Specifically, N-glycanase 1 removes glycans from misfolded proteins. This step is thought to be essential for certain abnormal proteins to be broken down (degraded).","NGLY1-congenital disorder of deglycosylation At least 13 mutations in the NGLY1 gene have been found to cause NGLY1-congenital disorder of deglycosylation (NGLY1-CDDG). This condition affects many body systems, causing delayed development, movement abnormalities, problems with liver function, eye abnormalities, and a reduction or absence of tears (hypolacrima or alacrima). These mutations impair production of the N-glycanase 1 enzyme, resulting in a severe reduction or absence of the enzyme's function. Without the removal of glycans, certain misfolded proteins cannot be broken down. It is thought that the abnormal proteins accumulate and form clumps (aggregates) in cells. These aggregates may damage cells in the brain, liver, and eyes, leading to the signs and symptoms of NGLY1-CDDG. "
909,NHLRC1 ,NHL repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1,"The NHLRC1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called malin. Although this protein is active in cells throughout the body, it appears to play a critical role in the survival of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain.Malin is part of the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unwanted proteins within cells. The protein tags damaged and excess proteins with a molecule called ubiquitin, which serves as a signal to degrade these proteins. This process, which is known as the ubiquitin-proteasome system, acts as the cell's quality control system by disposing of damaged, misshapen, and excess proteins. This system also regulates the level of proteins involved in several critical cell activities such as the timing of cell division and growth. Malin belongs to a group of proteins in the ubiquitin-proteasome system called E3 protein-ubiquitin ligases.Malin targets several proteins for degradation, including laforin (which is produced from the EPM2A gene). The interaction between malin and laforin likely plays a critical role in regulating the production of a complex sugar called glycogen. Glycogen is a major source of stored energy in the body. The body stores this sugar in the liver and muscles, breaking it down when it is needed for fuel. Researchers believe that malin and laforin may prevent a potentially damaging buildup of glycogen in tissues that do not normally store this molecule, such as those of the nervous system.","Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy More than 45 mutations in the NHLRC1 gene have been identified in people with Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Many of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the malin protein. Other mutations delete or insert genetic material in the NHLRC1 gene. Almost all mutations in this gene prevent cells from producing any malin or lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of the protein.The most common NHLRC1 gene mutation replaces the amino acid proline with the amino acid alanine at position 69 in the malin protein (written as Pro69Ala or P69A). This mutation has been found in many affected individuals of Portuguese, Italian, and Spanish heritage. The second most common NHLRC1 gene mutation replaces the amino acid glycine with a premature stop signal in the instructions for making malin (written as Gly158Ter or G158X). This mutation has been seen in affected individuals from several different ethnic groups.It is unclear how mutations in the NHLRC1 gene lead to the major features of Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Studies suggest that a loss of malin prevents cells from regulating the production of glycogen. As a result, distinctive clumps called Lafora bodies form within many types of cells. Lafora bodies are made up of an abnormal form of glycogen (called polyglucosan) that cannot be broken down and used for fuel. Instead, polyglucosans build up to form clumps that can damage cells. Neurons appear to be particularly vulnerable to this type of damage. Although Lafora bodies are found in many of the body's tissues, the signs and symptoms of Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy are limited to the nervous system.Researchers are uncertain how a loss of functional malin contributes to the formation of Lafora bodies. However, a lack of this protein ultimately results in the death of neurons, which interferes with the brain's normal functions. The degeneration of neurons likely underlies the seizures, movement abnormalities, intellectual decline, and other neurological problems seen with Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy. "
910,NIPBL ,"NIPBL, cohesin loading factor","The NIPBL gene provides instructions for making a protein called delangin, which plays an important role in human development. Before birth, delangin is found in the developing arms and legs, the bones of the skull and face, the spinal column, the heart, and other parts of the body.Delangin helps control the activity of chromosomes during cell division. Before cells divide, they must copy all of their chromosomes. The copied DNA from each chromosome is arranged into two identical structures, called sister chromatids. The sister chromatids are attached to one another during the early stages of cell division by a group of proteins known as the cohesin complex. Delangin plays a critical role in the regulation of this complex. Specifically, it controls the interaction between the cohesion complex and the DNA that makes up the sister chromatids.Researchers believe that delangin, as a regulator of the cohesin complex, also plays important roles in stabilizing cells' genetic information, repairing damaged DNA, and controlling the activity of certain genes that are essential for normal development.","Cornelia de Lange syndrome More than 300 mutations in the NIPBL gene have been identified in people with Cornelia de Lange syndrome, a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body. Mutations in this gene are the most common known cause of Cornelia de Lange syndrome, accounting for more than half of all cases.Many different kinds of NIPBL gene mutations have been reported; most lead to the production of an abnormally short (truncated), nonfunctional version of the delangin protein from one copy of the gene in each cell. These mutations reduce the overall amount of delangin produced in cells, which likely alters the activity of the cohesin complex and impairs its ability to regulate genes that are critical for normal development. Although researchers do not fully understand how these changes cause Cornelia de Lange syndrome, they suspect that altered gene regulation probably underlies many of the developmental problems characteristic of the condition. Studies suggest that mutations leading to a nonfunctional version of delangin tend to cause more severe signs and symptoms than mutations that result in a partially functional version of the protein. "
911,NKX2-1 ,NK2 homeobox 1,"The NKX2-1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called homeobox protein Nkx-2.1, which is a member of the homeobox protein family. Homeobox proteins direct the formation of body structures during early embryonic development. Homeobox protein Nkx-2.1 is particularly involved in the development and function of the brain, lungs, and thyroid gland. The thyroid is a butterfly shaped gland in the lower neck that makes hormones to help regulate a wide variety of critical body functions, including growth and brain development.Homeobox protein Nkx-2.1 functions as a transcription factor, which means it attaches to DNA and controls the activity (expression) of other genes. In the brain, homeobox protein Nkx-2.1 regulates genes that play a role in the development and movement (migration) of specialized nerve cells (neurons), called interneurons, to their proper location. Interneurons relay signals between other neurons. In the lungs, homeobox protein Nkx-2.1 controls development of lung structures and regulates the expression of surfactant genes, which provide instructions for producing surfactant proteins. Together with certain fats, these proteins form surfactant, which lines the lung tissue and makes breathing easy. In the thyroid gland, homeobox protein Nkx-2.1 controls genes that are critical in the production of thyroid hormones.","Brain-lung-thyroid syndrome At least 100 mutations in the NKX2-1 gene have been found to cause brain-lung-thyroid syndrome, which encompasses a group of conditions that affect the brain, lungs, and thyroid gland. About half of affected individuals have problems with all three organs, while others have problems with one or two of them. The most common features of this syndrome are benign hereditary chorea, which involves involuntary jerking movements (chorea) of the face, torso, and limbs and other uncontrolled movements; severe breathing difficulty (respiratory distress syndrome); and reduced thyroid gland function (hypothyroidism).Many of the NKX2-1 gene mutations involved in brain-lung-thyroid syndrome result in an abnormally short homeobox protein Nkx-2.1 that cannot function normally. Other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the protein, impairing its ability to attach to DNA. Still others delete the whole NKX2-1 gene. A shortage of functional homeobox protein Nkx-2.1 alters the expression of genes important for the normal development and functioning of the brain, lungs, and thyroid. The production of surfactant proteins is reduced, leading to breathing difficulty; expression of genes involved in the production of thyroid hormones is impaired, accounting for hypothyroidism; and brain development is impaired, likely due to improper interneuron formation or migration, which may underlie the movement abnormalities characteristic of brain-lung-thyroid syndrome. "
912,NLRP1 ,NLR family pyrin domain containing 1,"The NLRP1 gene provides instructions for making a member of a family of proteins called nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) proteins. These proteins are involved in the immune system, helping to regulate the process of inflammation. Inflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair. The body then stops (inhibits) the inflammatory response to prevent damage to its own cells and tissues.The NLRP1 protein is involved in the assembly of a molecular complex called an inflammasome, which helps trigger the inflammatory process in response to the presence of bacteria or viruses. Researchers believe that the NLRP1 protein may also play a role in the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).","Vitiligo Studies have associated variations in the NLRP1 gene with an increased risk of vitiligo, an autoimmune condition that results in patchy changes in skin coloring (pigmentation).One of the NLRP1 gene variations associated with vitiligo changes the protein building block (amino acid) leucine to the amino acid histidine at position 155 in the NLRP1 protein sequence, written as Leu155His or L155H. This and other variations likely affect the activity of the NLRP1 protein, making it more difficult for the body to control inflammation and prevent the immune system from attacking its own tissues. While the pigment loss associated with vitiligo results from the immune system attacking pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) in the skin, it is unclear what specific circumstances trigger the immune system to do so. The condition probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, most of which have not been identified. "
913,NLRP3 ,NLR family pyrin domain containing 3,"The NLRP3 gene (also known as CIAS1) provides instructions for making a protein called cryopyrin. Cryopyrin is a member of a family of proteins called nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) proteins, which are found in the fluid inside cells (cytoplasm). Cryopyrin is found mainly in white blood cells and in cartilage-forming cells (chondrocytes).NLR proteins are involved in the immune system, helping to start and regulate the immune system's response to injury, toxins, or invasion by microorganisms. These proteins recognize specific molecules, become activated, and respond by helping to engage components of the immune system. Cryopyrin recognizes bacterial particles; chemicals such as asbestos, silica, and uric acid crystals; and compounds released by injured cells.Once activated, groups of cryopyrin molecules assemble themselves along with other proteins into structures called inflammasomes, which are involved in the process of inflammation. Inflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules as well as white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair.","Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome Several mutations in the NLRP3 gene have been identified in people with familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome. These mutations are in a region of the gene known as exon 3. Researchers believe that the mutations cause cryopyrin to be hyperactive, leading to episodes of fever and inflammation that are usually triggered by exposure to cold. "
914,NLRP7 ,NLR family pyrin domain containing 7,"The NLRP7 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose role is not known. The NLRP7 protein is thought to be involved in regulating gene activity (expression) through a phenomenon known as genomic imprinting. Through genomic imprinting, certain genes are turned off (inactivated) based on which parent the copy of the gene came from. For most genes, both copies of the gene (one copy inherited from each parent) are active in all cells. However, for a small subset of genes, only one of the two copies is active and the other is turned off. For some of these genes, the copy from the father is normally active, while for others, the copy from the mother is normally active.Research suggests that the NLRP7 protein also plays a role in egg cell (oocyte) and embryonic development as well as inflammation and other immune responses by regulating the release of an immune protein called interleukin-1 beta.","Recurrent hydatidiform mole More than 75 mutations in the NLRP7 gene have been found to cause a pregnancy-related condition called recurrent hydatidiform mole. A hydatidiform mole is a mass that forms early in pregnancy and is made up of cells from an abnormally developed embryo and placenta. The placenta, a structure in the uterus that normally provides nutrients to a growing fetus, is dysfunctional and appears as numerous small sacs, often described as resembling a bunch of grapes. When a hydatidiform mole occurs more than once, the condition is known as recurrent hydatidiform mole. NLRP7 gene mutations account for recurrent hydatidiform mole in about 55 percent of women with this condition.The NLRP7 gene mutations that cause recurrent hydatidiform mole lead to production of a protein with reduced function or prevent production of any protein at all. As a result, oocytes do not develop normally. A pregnancy that results from an abnormal oocyte cannot develop properly, resulting in recurrent hydatidiform mole. NLRP7 gene mutations can also prevent proper imprinting of multiple genes that contribute to a developing embryo, leading to abnormal gene activity (expression). It is not clear if problems with imprinting also contribute to the development of a hydatidiform mole. In women with NLRP7 gene mutations, a hydatidiform mole will develop in every pregnancy that occurs with her egg cells. Additionally, NLRP7 gene mutations result in slowed release of interleukin-1 beta. A shortage of this protein disrupts the normal immune response that would remove the hydatidiform mole from the body. Instead, the hydatidiform mole must be removed surgically. "
915,NLRP12 ,NLR family pyrin domain containing 12,"The NLRP12 gene provides instructions for making a protein called monarch-1. Monarch-1 is a member of a family of proteins called nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) proteins, which are found in the fluid inside cells (cytoplasm). Monarch-1 is found mainly in certain types of white blood cells.NLR proteins are involved in the immune system, helping to regulate the immune system's response to injury, toxins, or invasion by microorganisms. Unlike most NLR proteins that promote increased activity by the immune system, monarch-1 stops (inhibits) the release of certain molecules that are involved in the process of inflammation.Inflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules as well as white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair. When this has been accomplished, stopping the inflammatory response helps to prevent damage to the body's own cells and tissues.","Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome Two mutations in the NLRP12 gene have been identified in families with familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome from the Caribbean archipelago of Guadeloupe. These mutations appear to reduce the ability of the monarch-1 protein to inhibit the inflammatory response, resulting in the episodes of fever and inflammation seen in this disorder. "
916,NNT ,nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase,"The NNT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase. This enzyme is found embedded in the inner membrane of structures called mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers of cells. This enzyme helps produce a substance called NADPH, which is involved in removing potentially toxic molecules called reactive oxygen species that can damage DNA, proteins, and cell membranes. Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase is found throughout the body, but it is particularly abundant in the hormone-producing adrenal and thyroid glands, heart, kidneys, and fatty tissue.","Familial glucocorticoid deficiency At least 25 mutations in the NNT gene have been found to cause familial glucocorticoid deficiency. This condition is characterized by potentially life-threatening low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), recurrent infections, and skin coloring darker than that of other family members (hyperpigmentation). The features of familial glucocorticoid deficiency are caused by an inability of the adrenal glands to produce a group of hormones called glucocorticoids, which play a role in many functions in the body. NNT gene mutations account for approximately 10 percent of cases of this condition.Most of the mutations that cause familial glucocorticoid deficiency change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase enzyme. These mutations impair the enzyme's ability to produce NADPH, leading to an increase in reactive oxygen species in the adrenal glands. Over time, these toxic molecules can impair the function of adrenal gland cells and lead to the death of those cells (apoptosis), diminishing the production of glucocorticoids. A shortage of these hormones impairs blood sugar regulation, immune system function, and other cellular functions, leading to the signs and symptoms of familial glucocorticoid deficiency.It is unclear why NNT gene mutations seem to only affect adrenal gland function. Researchers suggest that individuals with familial glucocorticoid deficiency caused by NNT gene mutations could develop problems in other tissues over time as reactive oxygen species exert their harmful effects. "
917,NOD2 ,nucleotide binding oligomerization domain containing 2,"The NOD2 gene (previously known as CARD15) provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in immune system function. The NOD2 protein is active in some types of immune system cells (including monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells), which help protect the body against foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. The protein is also active in several types of epithelial cells, including Paneth cells, which are found in the lining of the intestine. These cells help defend the intestinal wall against bacterial infection.The NOD2 protein has several critical functions in defending the body against foreign invaders. The protein is involved in recognizing certain bacteria and stimulating the immune system to respond appropriately. When triggered by specific substances produced by bacteria, the NOD2 protein turns on (activates) a protein complex called nuclear factor-kappa-B. This protein complex regulates the activity of multiple genes, including genes that control immune responses and inflammatory reactions. An inflammatory reaction occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair.The NOD2 protein also appears to play a role in a process called autophagy, which cells use to surround and destroy bacteria, viruses, and other harmful substances. In addition to protecting cells from infection, autophagy is used to recycle worn-out cell parts and break down certain proteins when they are no longer needed. This process is also involved in the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).","Blau syndrome At least 22 mutations in the NOD2 gene have been found to cause Blau syndrome, an inflammatory disorder that begins in childhood and primarily affects the skin, joints, and eyes. These mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the NOD2 protein. All of these mutations result in a version of the NOD2 protein that is overactive, which can trigger an abnormal inflammatory reaction and cause swelling and irritation. However, it is unclear how the abnormally active protein causes the specific pattern of inflammation affecting the skin, joints, and eyes that is characteristic of Blau syndrome.NOD2 gene mutations can also cause early-onset sarcoidosis, a similar condition that some researchers consider to be a noninherited version of Blau syndrome. "
918,NOG ,noggin,"The NOG gene provides instructions for making a protein called noggin. This protein is involved in the development of many body tissues, including nerve tissue, muscles, and bones. Noggin's role in bone development makes it important for proper joint formation.Noggin interacts with members of a group of proteins called bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). These proteins help control the development of bone and other tissues. In order to begin these developmental processes, BMPs attach (bind) to other proteins called receptors, and this binding stimulates specific cellular processes. The noggin protein regulates the activity of certain BMPs by attaching to them and blocking them from binding to the receptor, which leads to a decrease in BMP signaling.","Tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome Several mutations in the NOG gene have been identified in people with a condition called tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome. This condition is characterized by fusion of the individual bones in the wrists (the carpal bones) and in the ankles (the tarsal bones) as well as fusion at the joints between the bones that make up each finger and toe (symphalangism). Symphalangism makes the fingers and toes stiff and difficult to bend.This condition is caused by mutations in the NOG gene that change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the noggin protein. These mutations alter the structure or stability of noggin, impair the transport of noggin out of the cell, or reduce the protein's ability to bind to BMPs, resulting in a reduction of functional noggin protein. With decreased noggin function, BMPs abnormally stimulate bone formation in joint areas, where there should be no bone, causing the bone fusions seen in people with tarsal-carpal coalition syndrome. "
919,NOP56 ,NOP56 ribonucleoprotein,"The NOP56 gene provides instructions for making a protein called nucleolar protein 56, which is found in the nucleus of nerve cells (neurons). This protein is mostly found in neurons within an area of the brain called the cerebellum, which is involved in coordinating movements. Nucleolar protein 56 is one part (subunit) of the ribonucleoprotein complex, which is composed of proteins and molecules of RNA, DNA's chemical cousin. The ribonucleoprotein complex is needed to make cellular structures called ribosomes, which process the cell's genetic instructions to create proteins.Located within the NOP56 gene, in an area known as intron 1, is a string of six DNA building blocks (nucleotides); this string, known as a hexanucleotide, is represented by the letters GGCCTG and is typically repeated 3 to 14 times within intron 1. The function of this repeated hexanucleotide is unclear.","Spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 NOP56 gene mutations cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 (SCA36), which is a condition characterized by progressive movement problems that typically begin in mid-adulthood. In people with SCA36, the GGCCTG string in intron 1 is repeated at least 650 times.To make proteins from the genetic instructions carried in genes, a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) is formed. This molecule acts as a genetic blueprint for protein production. However, a large increase in the number of GGCCTG repeats in the NOP56 gene disrupts the normal structure of NOP56 mRNA. Abnormal NOP56 mRNA molecules form clumps called RNA foci within the nucleus of neurons. Other proteins become trapped in the RNA foci, where they cannot function. These proteins may be important for controlling gene activity or protein production.Additionally, researchers believe that the large expansion of the hexanucleotide repeat in the NOP56 gene may reduce the activity of a nearby gene called MIR1292. The MIR1292 gene provides instructions for making a type of RNA that regulates the activity (expression) of genes that produce proteins called glutamate receptors. These proteins are found on the surface of neurons and allow these cells to communicate with one another. A decrease in the production of Mir1292 RNA can lead to an increase in the production of glutamate receptors. The increased receptor activity may overexcite neurons, which disrupts normal communication between cells and can contribute to movement difficulties.The combination of RNA foci and overly excited neurons likely leads to the death of neurons over time. Because the NOP56 gene is especially active in neurons in the cerebellum, these cells are particularly affected by expansion of the gene, leading to cell death in the cerebellum. Deterioration in this part of the brain leads to ataxia and the other signs and symptoms of SCA36. "
920,NOTCH1 ,notch 1,"The NOTCH1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called Notch1, a member of the Notch family of receptors. Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. Attachment of a ligand to the Notch1 receptor sends signals that are important for normal development of many tissues throughout the body, both before birth and after. Notch1 signaling helps determine the specialization of cells into certain cell types that perform particular functions in the body (cell fate determination). It also plays a role in cell growth and division (proliferation), maturation (differentiation), and self-destruction (apoptosis).The protein produced from the NOTCH1 gene has such diverse functions that the gene is considered both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor. Oncogenes typically promote cell proliferation or survival, and when mutated, they have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous. In contrast, tumor suppressors keep cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way, preventing the development of cancer; mutations that impair tumor suppressors can lead to cancer development.","Adams-Oliver syndrome At least 15 mutations in the NOTCH1 gene have been found to cause Adams-Oliver syndrome, a condition characterized by areas of missing skin (aplasia cutis congenita), usually on the scalp, and malformations of the hands and feet. These mutations are usually inherited and are present in every cell of the body. Some of the NOTCH1 gene mutations involved in Adams-Oliver syndrome lead to production of an abnormally short protein that is likely broken down quickly, causing a shortage of Notch1. Other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the Notch1 protein. These changes are thought to alter the structure of the protein, impairing its ability to function. Loss of Notch1 signaling may underlie blood vessel and heart abnormalities in people with Adams-Oliver syndrome. However, while these types of abnormalities are more common in affected individuals with NOTCH1 gene mutations than in those with a different gene mutation, some people with Notch1-related Adams-Oliver syndrome do not have blood vessel or heart abnormalities. It is not clear how loss of Notch1 function leads to the scalp and limb abnormalities characteristic of the condition. Researchers suggest these features may be due to abnormal blood vessel development before birth. "
921,NOTCH2 ,notch 2,"The NOTCH2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called Notch2, a member of the Notch family of receptors. Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. Attachment of a ligand to the Notch2 receptor sends signals that are important for normal development and function of many tissues throughout the body, both before and after birth. In particular, research indicates that Notch2 signaling is important for the development of cells destined to be part of the heart, liver, kidneys, teeth, bones, and other structures in a growing embryo. After birth, Notch2 signaling is involved in immune system function, tissue repair, and a process called bone remodeling, in which old bone is removed and new bone is created to replace it.The Notch2 receptor has several major parts. A region of the receptor called the extracellular domain extends from the surface of the cell and binds to ligands. This binding triggers the part of the receptor inside the cell, known as the intracellular domain or NICD, to be cut (cleaved) from the rest of the protein. The NICD then moves into the cell's nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins to regulate the activity of specific genes. The very end of the NICD contains a region known as a proline-, glutamic acid-, serine-, and threonine-rich (PEST) domain. The PEST domain is necessary for the NICD to be broken down, which stops Notch2 signaling at the appropriate time.","Alagille syndrome NOTCH2 gene mutations appear to be a relatively uncommon cause of Alagille syndrome, a condition that can affect the liver, heart, and other parts of the body. At least 10 mutations in the NOTCH2 gene have been associated with the condition. These mutations can affect either the intracellular or extracellular domain of the Notch2 receptor. The genetic changes probably lead to the production of a receptor that is abnormally small or folded into the wrong 3-dimensional shape. These mutations are described as ""loss-of-function"" because the defective receptor is unable to bind to its ligands and trigger signaling within the cell. Disrupted Notch2 signaling is believed to affect the development of numerous organs and tissues, resulting in the signs and symptoms of Alagille syndrome. "
922,NOTCH3 ,notch 3,"The NOTCH3 gene provides instructions for making a protein with one end (the intracellular end) that remains inside the cell, a middle (transmembrane) section that spans the cell membrane, and another end (the extracellular end) that projects from the outer surface of the cell. The NOTCH3 protein is called a receptor protein because certain other proteins, called ligands, attach (bind) to the extracellular end of NOTCH3, fitting like a key into a lock. This binding causes detachment of the intracellular end of the NOTCH3 protein, called the NOTCH3 intracellular domain, or NICD. The NICD enters the cell nucleus and helps control the activity (transcription) of other genes.The NOTCH3 protein plays a key role in the function and survival of vascular smooth muscle cells, which are muscle cells that surround blood vessels. This protein is thought to be essential for the maintenance of blood vessels, including those that supply blood to the brain.","Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy More than 270 mutations in the NOTCH3 gene have been found to cause cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, commonly known as CADASIL. Almost all of these mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the NOTCH3 protein. The amino acid involved in most mutations is cysteine. The addition or deletion of a cysteine molecule in a certain area of the NOTCH3 protein, known as the EGF-like domain, presumably affects NOTCH3 function in vascular smooth muscle cells. Disruption of NOTCH3 functioning can lead to the self-destruction (apoptosis) of these cells. Damage to vascular smooth muscle cells is thought to cause recurrent strokes and other signs and symptoms of CADASIL. "
923,NPC1 ,NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1,"The NPC1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is located within the membrane of compartments in the cell called lysosomes and endosomes, which digest and recycle materials. While the exact function of this protein is unclear, it plays a role in the movement of cholesterol and other types of fats (lipids) within cells and across cell membranes.","Niemann-Pick disease More than 380 mutations in the NPC1 gene have been found to cause Niemann-Pick disease type C1. This type of Niemann-Pick disease is characterized by a buildup of fat within cells that leads to movement problems, neurological impairment, lung and liver disease, and speech and feeding problems. Many of the NPC1 gene mutations result in a change in a single protein building block (amino acid) in the NPC1 protein. These mutations usually cause a shortage of functional protein, which prevents movement of cholesterol and other lipids, leading to their accumulation in cells. Because these lipids are not in their proper location in cells, many normal cell functions that require lipids (such as cell membrane formation) are impaired. The accumulation of lipids and the cell dysfunction eventually leads to cell death, causing the tissue and organ damage seen in Niemann-Pick disease type C1. "
924,NPC2 ,NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 2,"The NPC2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is located inside lysosomes, which are compartments in the cell that digest and recycle materials. The NPC2 protein attaches (binds) to cholesterol. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is produced in the body and obtained from foods. Research suggests that the NPC2 protein plays an important role in moving cholesterol and certain other fats (lipids) out of the lysosomes to other parts of the cell.","Niemann-Pick disease More than 20 mutations in the NPC2 gene have been found to cause Niemann-Pick disease type C2. This type of Niemann-Pick disease is characterized by a buildup of fat within cells that leads to movement problems, neurological impairment, lung and liver disease, and speech and feeding problems. The NPC2 gene mutations that cause Niemann-Pick disease type C2 reduce or eliminate NPC2 protein activity, which prevents movement of cholesterol and other lipids, leading to their accumulation in cells. Because these lipids are not in their proper location in cells, many normal cell functions that require lipids (such as cell membrane formation) are impaired. The accumulation of lipids and the cell dysfunction eventually leads to cell death, causing the tissue and organ damage seen in Niemann-Pick disease type C2. "
925,NPHP1 ,nephrocystin 1,"The NPHP1 gene provides instructions for making the nephrocystin-1 protein. This protein is thought to play a role in cell structures called cilia, which are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. Cilia participate in signaling pathways that transmit information within and between cells and are important for the development and function of many types of cells and tissues. Nephrocystin-1 is found at the base of cilia in cells of the kidneys, respiratory tract, and the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). Although the specific function of nephrocystin-1 is not well understood, it is thought to interact with a number of other proteins as part of a large protein complex that may be important for normal cilia function.","Nephronophthisis At least 23 mutations in the NPHP1 gene have been found to cause a kidney disorder called nephronophthisis type 1. Type 1 is the most common type of nephronophthisis, accounting for approximately 20 percent of cases of the disorder. Nephronophthisis is characterized by inflammation and scarring of the kidneys and ultimately leads to a life-threatening failure of kidney function (end-stage renal disease or ESRD). In nephronophthisis type 1, ESRD usually occurs around age 13.The most common genetic change in nephronophthisis type 1 is a large deletion on chromosome 2 that removes the whole NPHP1 gene. Other deletions that remove all or most of the gene or a small portion of the gene can also be involved in this condition. Some mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) or lead to an abnormally short nephrocystin-1 protein. It is thought that people with nephronophthisis type 1 have little or no functional nephrocystin-1. The lack of this protein probably impairs the function of cilia in some way, which likely disrupts important chemical signaling pathways during development. Although researchers believe that defective cilia are responsible for the features of nephronophthisis, the mechanism remains unclear. "
926,NPHS1 ,"NPHS1, nephrin","The NPHS1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called nephrin. Nephrin is primarily found in the kidneys, which are organs that filter waste products from the blood and remove them in urine. Specifically, nephrin is found in cells called podocytes, which are located in specialized kidney structures called glomeruli. Nephrin is located at the cell surface in the area between two podocytes called the slit diaphragm. The slit diaphragm is known as a filtration barrier because it captures proteins in blood so that they remain in the body while allowing other molecules like sugars and salts to be excreted in urine. Nephrin proteins on one cell interact with nephrin proteins on adjacent podocytes, forming a zipper-like structure. This structure allows the passage of small molecules through the slit diaphragm while preventing larger molecules like proteins from passing through. Nephrin proteins are essential for forming the slit diaphragm, anchoring the slit diaphragm to podocytes, and filtering blood.Nephrin is also involved in cell signaling. It relays signals from outside the cell to inside the cell. Additionally, nephrin proteins on the surface of adjacent cells send and receive signals, allowing podocytes to communicate with one another.","Congenital nephrotic syndrome At least 250 mutations in the NPHS1 gene have been found to cause congenital nephrotic syndrome. This condition is a kidney disorder that begins in infancy and typically leads to irreversible kidney failure (end-stage renal disease) by early childhood.NPHS1 gene mutations account for all cases of congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type. This form of the condition is found in people of Finnish ancestry. Two specific mutations, both of which result in an abnormally short, nonfunctional nephrin protein, account for nearly all cases. The first mutation, known as Finnmajor, is written as L41fsX90 and is responsible for 78 percent of cases. The second mutation, known as Finnminor, is written as R1109X and is responsible for 16 percent of cases.NPHS1 gene mutations can also cause congenital nephrotic syndrome in non-Finnish individuals. Most of these mutations result in an abnormal nephrin protein that is trapped inside the cell and cannot get to the podocyte cell surface. A shortage of functional nephrin at the podocyte cell surface impairs the formation of normal slit diaphragms. Without a functional slit diaphragm, molecules pass through the kidneys abnormally and are excreted in urine. The filtering ability of the kidneys worsens from birth, eventually leading to end-stage renal disease. "
927,NPHS2 ,"NPHS2, podocin","The NPHS2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called podocin. Podocin is primarily found in the kidneys, which are organs that filter waste products from the blood and remove them in urine. Specifically, podocin is found in cells called podocytes, which are located in specialized kidney structures called glomeruli. Podocin is located at the cell surface in the area between two podocytes called the slit diaphragm. The slit diaphragm is known as a filtration barrier because it captures proteins in blood so that they remain in the body while allowing other molecules like sugars and salts to be excreted in urine. Podocin likely helps bring other proteins that are needed for a functional slit diaphragm to the podocyte cell surface. The protein also is involved with podocyte cell signaling, helping the cell adapt to changes that occur during the filtration process.","Congenital nephrotic syndrome At least 170 mutations in the NPHS2 gene have been found to cause congenital nephrotic syndrome. This condition is a kidney disorder that begins in infancy and typically leads to irreversible kidney failure (end-stage renal disease) by early childhood. Mutations in this gene appear to be the most frequent cause of congenital nephrotic syndrome. Most NPHS2 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the podocin protein. These mutations result in a reduction or absence of functional protein, which impairs the formation of normal slit diaphragms. Without a functional slit diaphragm, molecules pass through the kidneys abnormally and are excreted in urine. The filtering ability of the kidneys worsens from birth, eventually leading to end-stage renal disease. "
928,NPM1 ,nucleophosmin 1,"The NPM1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called nucleophosmin, which is found in a small region inside the nucleus of the cell called the nucleolus. Nucleophosmin shuttles back and forth between the nucleus and the fluid surrounding it (the cytoplasm). It is thought to play a part in many cellular functions, including processes involved in protein formation, DNA replication, and the progression of the cell through the step-by-step process it takes to replicate itself (called the cell cycle). In the nucleolus, nucleophosmin attaches to another protein called ARF, keeping it in the proper location and protecting it from being broken down. The ARF protein is considered a tumor suppressor because it is involved in pathways that prevent cells from growing and dividing in an uncontrolled way.",Acute promyelocytic leukemia Genetics Home Reference provides information about acute promyelocytic leukemia. 
929,NPRL2 ,"NPR2 like, GATOR1 complex subunit","The NPRL2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is one piece of a group of proteins (complex) called GATOR1. This complex is found in cells throughout the body, where it regulates a signaling pathway called the mTOR pathway. The mTOR pathway is involved in cell growth and division (proliferation), the survival of cells, and the creation (synthesis) of new proteins. The role of the GATOR1 complex is to block this pathway by inhibiting (stopping) the activity of a complex called mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) that is integral to the mTOR pathway.In the brain, the mTOR pathway regulates many processes, including the growth and development of nerve cells and their ability to change and adapt over time (plasticity).","Familial focal epilepsy with variable foci At least 6 NPRL2 gene mutations have been found to cause familial focal epilepsy with variable foci (FFEVF), which is an uncommon form of recurrent seizures (epilepsy) that runs in families. Most of these mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein. As a result, formation of normal GATOR1 complex is reduced, leading to overactivity of mTORC1 and excessive signaling of the mTOR pathway. It is not clear how an abnormally active mTOR pathway leads to the seizures of FFEVF. Research suggests that increased mTOR pathway signaling in the brain leads to changes in the connections between nerve cells (synapses) and increased activation (excitation) of nerve cells, which can cause seizures. "
930,NPRL3 ,"NPR3 like, GATOR1 complex subunit","The NPRL3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is one piece of a group of proteins (complex) called GATOR1. This complex is found in cells throughout the body, where it regulates a signaling pathway called the mTOR pathway. The mTOR pathway is involved in cell growth and division (proliferation), the survival of cells, and the creation (synthesis) of new proteins. The role of the GATOR1 complex is to block this pathway by inhibiting (stopping) the activity of a complex called mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) that is integral to the mTOR pathway.In the brain, the mTOR pathway regulates many processes, including the growth and development of nerve cells and their ability to change and adapt over time (plasticity).","Familial focal epilepsy with variable foci At least ten NPRL3 gene mutations have been found to cause familial focal epilepsy with variable foci (FFEVF), which is an uncommon form of recurrent seizures (epilepsy) that runs in families. Most of these mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein. As a result, formation of normal GATOR1 complex is reduced, leading to overactivity of mTORC1 and excessive signaling of the mTOR pathway. It is not clear how an abnormally active mTOR pathway leads to the seizures of FFEVF. Research suggests that increased mTOR pathway signaling in the brain leads to changes in the connections between nerve cells (synapses) and increased activation (excitation) of nerve cells, which can cause seizures. "
931,NR0B1 ,nuclear receptor subfamily 0 group B member 1,"The NR0B1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called DAX1. This protein plays an important role in the development and function of several hormone-producing (endocrine) tissues in the body. These tissues include the small glands located on top of each kidney (the adrenal glands), two hormone-secreting glands in the brain (the hypothalamus and pituitary), and the gonads (ovaries in females and testes in males). Before birth, the DAX1 protein helps regulate genes that direct the formation of these tissues. DAX1 also helps regulate hormone production in endocrine tissues after they have been formed.","X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita More than 110 NR0B1 mutations that cause X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita have been identified. Some of these genetic changes are deletions of all or part of the NR0B1 gene. Other mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the DAX1 protein. Still other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in a critical region of DAX1.Most of the mutations responsible for X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita prevent the NR0B1 gene from producing any active DAX1 protein. A shortage of DAX1 disrupts the normal development and function of hormone-producing tissues in the body. The main characteristics of this condition result when endocrine glands such as the adrenals, hypothalamus, pituitary, and gonads do not produce the right amounts of specific hormones. "
932,NR3C2 ,nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 2,"The NR3C2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called the mineralocorticoid receptor. This protein is important in regulating the amount of sodium in the body. Sodium regulation plays a role in blood pressure control and fluid balance. Certain hormones called mineralocorticoids attach (bind) to and turn on (activate) the mineralocorticoid receptor. Aldosterone is one mineralocorticoid that activates the mineralocorticoid receptor. The activated mineralocorticoid receptor acts as a transcription factor, which is a protein that binds to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity (transcription) of particular genes.The mineralocorticoid receptor regulates specialized proteins in the cell membrane that control the transport of sodium or potassium into cells. In response to signals that sodium levels in the body are low, the mineralocorticoid receptor increases the number and activity of these proteins at the cell membrane, especially in certain kidney cells. One of these proteins transports sodium into the cell, while another protein simultaneously transports sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell. These proteins help keep sodium in the body through a process called reabsorption and remove potassium from the body through a process called secretion.","Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 More than 50 mutations in the NR3C2 gene have been identified in people with pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1), a condition that typically begins in infancy and is characterized by low levels of sodium (hyponatremia) and high levels of potassium (hyperkalemia) in the blood. In particular, NR3C2 gene mutations are involved in autosomal dominant PHA1, a relatively mild form of the condition that can improve in childhood.Mutations in the NR3C2 gene lead to a nonfunctional or abnormally functioning mineralocorticoid receptor protein that cannot properly regulate the specialized proteins that transport sodium and potassium. As a result, sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion are both decreased, causing hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. "
933,NR5A1 ,nuclear receptor subfamily 5 group A member 1,"The NR5A1 gene provides instructions for producing a transcription factor called the steroidogenic factor 1. A transcription factor is a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. Steroidogenic factor 1 helps control the activity of several genes related to the development of the gonads (ovaries and testes) and the adrenal glands, which are small glands located on top of each kidney.","Swyer syndrome NR5A1 gene mutations have been identified in a small number of people with Swyer syndrome, a condition affecting sexual development also known as 46,XY complete gonadal dysgenesis or 46,XY pure gonadal dysgenesis.People usually have 46 chromosomes in each cell. Two of the 46 chromosomes, known as X and Y, are called sex chromosomes because they help determine whether a person will develop male or female sex characteristics. Girls and women typically have two X chromosomes (46,XX karyotype), while boys and men usually have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (46,XY karyotype).Mutations in the NR5A1 gene in people with Swyer syndrome affect the process of sexual differentiation, preventing affected individuals with a 46,XY karyotype from developing male gonads (testes) and causing them to develop female reproductive structures (a uterus and fallopian tubes). "
934,NRAS ,"NRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase","The NRAS gene provides instructions for making a protein called N-Ras that is involved primarily in regulating cell division. Through a process known as signal transduction, the protein relays signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. These signals instruct the cell to grow and divide (proliferate) or to mature and take on specialized functions (differentiate). The N-Ras protein is a GTPase, which means it converts a molecule called GTP into another molecule called GDP. The N-Ras protein acts like a switch, and it is turned on and off by the GTP and GDP molecules. To transmit signals, the N-Ras protein must be turned on by attaching (binding) to a molecule of GTP. The N-Ras protein is turned off (inactivated) when it converts the GTP to GDP. When the protein is bound to GDP, it does not relay signals to the cell's nucleus.The NRAS gene belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous. The NRAS gene is in the Ras family of oncogenes, which also includes two other genes: HRAS and KRAS. The proteins produced from these three genes are GTPases. These proteins play important roles in cell division, cell differentiation, and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).","Giant congenital melanocytic nevus At least two mutations in the NRAS gene have been found to cause giant congenital melanocytic nevus. This condition is characterized by a large, noncancerous patch of abnormally dark skin that is present from birth and an increased risk of a type of skin cell cancer called melanoma. The NRAS gene mutations that cause this condition are somatic, meaning that they occur during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. The mutations occur during embryonic development in cells that will develop into pigment-producing skin cells (melanocytes). The mutations that cause this condition affect a single protein building block (amino acid) in the N-Ras protein. Specifically, the mutations replace the amino acid glutamine at position 61 with either lysine or arginine (written as Gln61Lys or Q61K and Gln61Arg or Q61R). These mutations lead to production of an N-Ras protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively active). Instead of triggering cell growth in response to particular signals from outside the cell, the overactive protein directs cells to grow and divide constantly. The uncontrolled cell growth of early melanocytes leads to a large patch of darkly pigmented skin characteristic of giant congenital melanocytic nevus. Uncontrolled cell growth of melanocytes after birth contributes to the risk of developing melanoma in people with giant congenital melanocytic nevus. "
935,NSD1 ,nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 1,"The NSD1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that functions as a histone methyltransferase. Histone methyltransferases are enzymes that modify structural proteins called histones, which attach (bind) to DNA and give chromosomes their shape. By adding a molecule called a methyl group to histones (a process called methylation), histone methyltransferases control (regulate) the activity of certain genes and can turn them on and off as needed. The NSD1 enzyme controls the activity of genes involved in normal growth and development, although most of these genes have not been identified.","Sotos syndrome More than 380 mutations in the NSD1 gene have been identified in people with Sotos syndrome. The most common mutation in the Japanese population deletes genetic material from the region of chromosome 5 that contains the NSD1 gene. In most other populations, mutations within the gene itself are more frequent. These mutations include insertions or deletions of a small amount of DNA and changes in single DNA building blocks (base pairs) that make up the gene. Most mutations prevent one copy of the NSD1 gene from making any enzyme or lead to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the enzyme. Research suggests that a reduced amount of the NSD1 enzyme disrupts the normal activity of genes involved in growth and development. However, it remains unclear exactly how a shortage of this enzyme during development leads to overgrowth, learning disabilities, and the other signs and symptoms of Sotos syndrome. "
936,NSD2 ,nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 2,"The NSD2 gene (also known as WHSC1 and MMSET) provides instructions for making at least three very similar proteins known as MMSET I, MMSET II, and RE-IIBP. These proteins are active both before and after birth in many of the body's cells and tissues. They appear to play an important role in normal development.At least two of the proteins produced from the NSD2 gene, MMSET II and RE-IIBP, likely help regulate the activity of other genes. Studies suggest that these proteins function as histone methyltransferases, which are enzymes that modify DNA-associated proteins called histones. By adding a molecule called a methyl group to histones, histone methyltransferases can turn off (suppress) the activity of certain genes. Scientists are working to identify the genes targeted by the MMSET II and RE-IIBP proteins.","Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome The NSD2 gene is located in a region of chromosome 4 that is deleted in people with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. As a result of this deletion, affected individuals are missing one copy of the NSD2 gene in each cell. A loss of the NSD2 gene probably disrupts the regulation of several other genes, although these genes have not been identified. Researchers speculate that abnormal gene regulation during development contributes to many of the characteristic features of the disorder, including intellectual disability, growth delay, and a distinctive facial appearance. "
937,NSDHL ,NAD(P) dependent steroid dehydrogenase-like,"The NSDHL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is involved in the production (synthesis) of cholesterol. Cholesterol is a lipid (fat) that is obtained from foods that come from animals, particularly egg yolks, meat, fish, and dairy products. The body can also make (synthesize) its own cholesterol. During cholesterol synthesis, the NSDHL enzyme participates in one of several steps that convert a molecule called lanosterol to cholesterol. Specifically, the NSDHL enzyme removes a carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms (a methyl group) in the conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol.Although high cholesterol levels are a well-known risk factor for heart disease, the body needs some cholesterol to develop and function normally. Before birth, cholesterol interacts with signaling proteins that control early development of the brain, limbs, genital tract, and other structures. It is also an important component of cell membranes and myelin, the fatty covering that insulates nerve cells. Additionally, cholesterol is used to make certain hormones and is important for the production of acids used in digestion (bile acids).","Congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform erythroderma and limb defects At least 18 mutations in the NSDHL gene have been found to cause congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform erythroderma and limb defects (CHILD syndrome). Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the NSDHL enzyme. A few other mutations delete part or all of the NSDHL gene. Each of the identified mutations likely prevents the production of any functional NSDHL enzyme, which disrupts the normal synthesis of cholesterol within cells. A shortage of this enzyme may also allow potentially toxic byproducts of cholesterol synthesis to build up in the body's tissues. Researchers suspect that low cholesterol levels and/or an accumulation of other substances disrupts the growth and development of many parts of the body. It is not known, however, how a disturbance in cholesterol synthesis leads to the specific features of CHILD syndrome. "
938,NTRK1 ,neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 1,"The NTRK1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is essential for the development and survival of nerve cells (neurons), especially those that transmit information about sensations such as pain, temperature, and touch (sensory neurons). The NTRK1 protein is found on the surface of cells, particularly sensory neurons. It acts as a kinase, which is an enzyme that changes the activity of other proteins by adding a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) at specific positions. This process is called phosphorylation. The NTRK1 protein is turned on (activated) when another protein called nerve growth factor beta (NGFβ) attaches (binds) to it and signals the NTRK1 protein to phosphorylate itself (autophosphorylation). Then, the activated NTRK1 protein phosphorylates other proteins; this process is needed to transmit signals for cell growth and survival.","Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis Mutations in the NTRK1 gene cause congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA), a condition characterized by the inability to feel pain and decreased or absent sweating (anhidrosis). Many mutations in the NTRK1 gene are known to cause the condition. Many of the NTRK1 gene mutations lead to a protein that cannot be activated by phosphorylation, which means the mutated NTRK1 protein cannot transmit cell growth and survival signals to neurons. Without the proper signaling, neurons die by a process of self-destruction called apoptosis. Loss of sensory neurons leads to the inability to feel pain in people with CIPA. In addition, people with CIPA lose the nerves leading to their sweat glands, which causes the anhidrosis seen in affected individuals. "
939,NYX ,nyctalopin,"The NYX gene provides instructions for making a protein called nyctalopin, which plays an important role in a specialized tissue at the back of the eye called the retina. Within the retina, nyctalopin is located on the surface of light-detecting cells called photoreceptors. The retina contains two types of photoreceptors: rods and cones. Rods are responsible for vision in low light. Cones provide vision in bright light, including color vision.Nyctalopin appears to play a critical role in normal vision. Studies suggest the protein helps relay visual signals from rods and cones to other retinal cells called bipolar cells. This signaling is an essential step in the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain.","X-linked congenital stationary night blindness More than 50 mutations in the NYX gene have been identified in people with X-linked congenital stationary night blindness. Mutations in this gene are responsible for the complete form of the disorder, which is characterized by difficulty seeing in low light (night blindness), loss of sharpness (reduced acuity), severe nearsightedness (high myopia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus).Many NYX mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in nyctalopin. NYX mutations can change the size or shape of the protein or prevent it from attaching to the surface of photoreceptor cells. A loss of functional nyctalopin disrupts the ability of photoreceptor cells to transmit visual signals, which impairs vision. The function of rods is severely disrupted, while the function of cones is only mildly affected. "
940,OAT ,ornithine aminotransferase,"The OAT gene provides instructions for making the enzyme ornithine aminotransferase. This enzyme is active in the energy-producing centers of cells (mitochondria), where it helps break down a molecule called ornithine. Ornithine is involved in the urea cycle, which processes excess nitrogen (in the form of ammonia) that is generated when protein is broken down by the body.In addition to its role in the urea cycle, ornithine participates in several reactions that help ensure the proper balance of protein building blocks (amino acids) in the body. This balance is important because a specific sequence of amino acids is required to build each of the many different proteins needed for the body's functions. The ornithine aminotransferase enzyme helps convert ornithine into another molecule called pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C). P5C can be converted into the amino acids glutamate and proline.","Gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina More than 60 OAT gene mutations have been found to cause gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina (often shortened to gyrate atrophy). These mutations result in a reduced amount of functional ornithine aminotransferase enzyme. A shortage of this enzyme impedes the conversion of ornithine into P5C. As a result, excess ornithine accumulates in the blood (hyperornithinemia), and less P5C than normal is produced. It is not clear how these changes result in progressive vision loss and the other features sometimes associated with gyrate atrophy. Researchers have suggested that a deficiency of P5C may interfere with the function of the retina, the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. It has also been proposed that excess ornithine may suppress the production of a molecule called creatine. Creatine is needed for many tissues in the body to store and use energy properly. It is involved in providing energy for muscle contraction, and it is also important in nervous system functioning. "
941,OBSL1 ,obscurin like 1,"The OBSL1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is thought to help maintain normal levels of another protein called cullin-7, which is produced from the CUL7 gene. The cullin-7 protein plays a role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unwanted proteins.Cullin-7 helps assemble a complex known as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This complex tags damaged and excess proteins with molecules called ubiquitin. Ubiquitin serves as a signal to specialized cell structures known as proteasomes, which attach (bind) to the tagged proteins and degrade them. The ubiquitin-proteasome system acts as the cell's quality control system by disposing of damaged, misshapen, and excess proteins. This system also regulates the level of proteins involved in several critical cell activities such as the timing of cell division and growth. In particular, the OBSL1 protein and cullin-7 are thought to help regulate proteins involved in the body's response to growth hormones, although their specific role in this process is unknown.","3-M syndrome At least 29 mutations in the OBSL1 gene have been identified in people with 3-M syndrome, a disorder that causes skeletal abnormalities including short stature (dwarfism) and unusual facial features. Most of these mutations substitute one protein building block (amino acid) for another amino acid in the OBSL1 protein or result in an OBSL1 protein that is abnormally short and nonfunctional.Mutations in the OBSL1 gene likely lead to reduced cullin-7 protein levels, preventing cullin-7 from bringing together the components of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and interfering with the process of tagging unneeded proteins for degradation. The body's response to growth hormones may be impaired as a result. However, the specific relationship between OBSL1 gene mutations and the signs and symptoms of 3-M syndrome are unknown. "
942,OCA2 ,OCA2 melanosomal transmembrane protein,"The OCA2 gene (formerly called the P gene) provides instructions for making a protein called the P protein. This protein is located in melanocytes, which are specialized cells that produce a pigment called melanin. Melanin is the substance that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color. Melanin is also found in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina), where it plays a role in normal vision.Although the exact function of the P protein is unknown, it is essential for normal pigmentation and is likely involved in the production of melanin. Within melanocytes, the P protein may transport molecules into and out of structures called melanosomes (where melanin is produced). Researchers believe that this protein may also help regulate the relative acidity (pH) of melanosomes. Tight control of pH is necessary for most biological processes.","Oculocutaneous albinism More than 80 mutations in the OCA2 gene have been identified in people with oculocutaneous albinism type 2. People with this form of albinism often have light yellow, blond, or light brown hair; creamy white skin; light-colored eyes; and problems with vision. The most common OCA2 mutation is a large deletion in the gene, which is found in many affected individuals of sub-Saharan African heritage. Other OCA2 gene mutations, including changes in single DNA building blocks (base pairs) and small deletions, are more common in other populations. Mutations in the OCA2 gene disrupt the normal production of melanin, which reduces coloring of the hair, skin, and eyes and affects vision. "
943,OCRL ,"OCRL, inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase","The OCRL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is present in cells throughout the body. This enzyme is part of a larger group of enzymes that modify fat (lipid) molecules known as membrane phospholipids. These molecules form the basic structure of cell membranes. Specifically, the OCRL enzyme regulates the levels of a membrane phospholipid called phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.The OCRL enzyme is found in several areas within cells. It is concentrated in a complex network of membranes known as the trans-Golgi network, which sorts proteins and other molecules and sends them to their intended destinations inside or outside the cell. The OCRL enzyme is also found on endosomes, specialized compartments that are formed at the cell surface to carry proteins and other molecules to their destinations within the cell.By controlling the level of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, the OCRL enzyme helps regulate the transport of certain substances to and from the cell membrane and chemical signaling between cells. The enzyme may also be involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is a network of fibers that make up the cell's structural framework. The actin cytoskeleton has several critical functions, including determining cell shape and allowing cells to move.Recent research suggests that the OCRL enzyme is found in cell structures called primary cilia, which are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells and are involved in signaling pathways that transmit information between cells. Cilia are important for the structure and function of many types of cells, including cells in the brain, kidneys, and liver. Cilia are also necessary for the perception of sensory input (such as sight, hearing, and smell). Studies suggest that the OCRL enzyme may play a role in the formation, function, and maintenance of cilia.","Dent disease At least 20 mutations in the OCRL gene have been found to cause Dent disease 2. This form of Dent disease is characterized by chronic kidney problems; some affected individuals also have mild intellectual disability, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and clouding of the lens of the eyes (cataract) that does not impair vision. Some researchers consider Dent disease 2 to be a mild variant of Lowe syndrome, which is discussed below.The OCRL gene mutations that cause Dent disease 2 reduce or eliminate the function of the OCRL enzyme. These changes impair the transport of certain molecules and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. They may also affect cell signaling by altering the structure or function of cilia. Disruption of these important cell activities likely impairs kidney function, leading to excess protein in the urine (proteinuria), kidney stones, and ultimately kidney failure. It is unknown how loss of the OCRL enzyme contributes to the other signs and symptoms of this condition.Because the OCRL enzyme is present throughout the body, it is unclear why Dent disease 2 primarily affects the kidneys and, to a lesser extent, the brain, eyes, and other tissues. It is possible that other enzymes may be able to compensate for the defective OCRL enzyme in unaffected tissues. "
944,OFD1 ,"OFD1, centriole and centriolar satellite protein","The OFD1 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not fully understood. It appears to play a critical role in the early development of many parts of the body, including the brain, face, limbs, and kidneys.The OFD1 protein is located at the base of cilia, which are finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. Cilia are involved in cell movement and in many different chemical signaling pathways. They play important roles in the development and function of many parts of the body. Researchers suspect that the OFD1 protein is essential for the normal formation of cilia.Studies suggest that the OFD1 protein may have additional functions. In the earliest stages of development, it appears to be involved in determining the left-right axis (the imaginary line that separates the left and right sides of the body). The OFD1 protein is also found in the nucleus, although its function in this cell structure is unknown.","Oral-facial-digital syndrome About 100 mutations in the OFD1 gene have been found in people with oral-facial-digital syndrome type I, which is the most common form of the disorder. These mutations include changes in single DNA building blocks (base pairs) and larger deletions of genetic material from the OFD1 gene. Most of these genetic changes lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the OFD1 protein. It is unclear how a shortage of functional OFD1 protein leads to the specific features of oral-facial-digital syndrome type I. However, studies suggest that a lack of this protein prevents the normal formation of cilia, which affects the development of many tissues and organs. "
945,OPA1 ,"OPA1, mitochondrial dynamin like GTPase","The OPA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in cells and tissues throughout the body. The OPA1 protein is active in the inner membrane of cell structures called mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers in cells. Mitochondria are dynamic structures that change shape through processes called fission (splitting into smaller pieces) and fusion (combining pieces). Changes in shape are necessary for mitochondrial function and the production of new mitochondria. The OPA1 protein helps to regulate the shape of mitochondria by playing a key role in the fusion process.The OPA1 protein is also involved in a process that takes place in mitochondria called oxidative phosphorylation, from which cells derive much of their energy. Additionally, the OPA1 protein plays a role in the maintenance of the DNA within mitochondria, called mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and in controlled cell death (apoptosis).","Optic atrophy type 1 At least 240 mutations in the OPA1 gene have been found to cause optic atrophy type 1. This condition typically results in vision loss beginning in childhood that worsens over time. Affected individuals may also have problems with color vision, particularly distinguishing between shades of blue and green.Most of the OPA1 gene mutations that cause optic atrophy type 1 create a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the OPA1 protein. As a result, an abnormally small protein is produced, which is likely to be unstable and broken down quickly. The most common mutation that causes optic atrophy type 1 in individuals of Danish ancestry results in an abnormally small protein by deleting one DNA building block (nucleotide) in the OPA1 gene (written as 2826delT).OPA1 gene mutations that cause optic atrophy type 1 lead to problems in mitochondrial function. The mitochondria become misshapen and disorganized and have reduced energy-producing capabilities. The maintenance of mtDNA may also be impaired, resulting in mtDNA mutations that also contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction. Cells that contain these poorly functioning mitochondria are more susceptible to apoptosis. In particular, cells within the retina called retinal ganglion cells die over time. Specialized extensions of retinal ganglion cells, called axons, form the optic nerves, so when retinal ganglion cells die, the optic nerves break down (atrophy) and cannot transmit visual information to the brain. As the optic nerves atrophy, vision worsens, leading to the signs and symptoms of optic atrophy type 1.While the OPA1 protein is found in cells throughout the body, retinal ganglion cells appear to be particularly sensitive to the effects of OPA1 gene mutations. These cells have especially high energy requirements that make them more likely to malfunction and die when there are changes in mitochondrial function and decreases in energy production. "
946,OPA3 ,"OPA3, outer mitochondrial membrane lipid metabolism regulator","The OPA3 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose exact function is unknown. The OPA3 protein is found in structures called mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers of cells. The OPA3 protein is thought to play a role in the organization of the shape and structure of the mitochondria and in controlled cell death (apoptosis).","Autosomal dominant optic atrophy and cataract At least four mutations in the OPA3 gene have been found to cause autosomal dominant optic atrophy and cataract. This condition causes slowly worsening vision in both eyes that often begins at birth. The severity of the vision loss varies widely, even among affected members of the same family. People with this condition have degeneration (atrophy) of the optic nerves, which carry information from the eyes to the brain, and clouding of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts). Some affected individuals have additional features such as hearing loss or movement problems.Mutations in the OPA3 gene that cause autosomal dominant optic atrophy and cataract occur in one copy of the gene in each cell. A mutation that has been found in multiple people with autosomal dominant optic atrophy and cataract results in the production of a protein with the building block (amino acid) glutamine replaced with the amino acid glutamic acid at position 105 (written as Gln105Glu or Q105E).This and other OPA3 gene mutations that cause autosomal dominant optic atrophy and cataract lead to abnormal mitochondrial function. The mitochondria become misshapen and disorganized and have reduced energy-producing capabilities. Cells that contain these poorly functioning mitochondria seem to be more susceptible to apoptosis, particularly those with high energy demands, such as a type in the eye called retinal ganglion cells. Specialized extensions of retinal ganglion cells, called axons, form the optic nerves, so when retinal ganglion cells die, the optic nerves atrophy and cannot transmit visual information to the brain. Loss of retinal ganglion cells and optic nerve atrophy contribute to vision impairment in people with autosomal dominant optic atrophy and cataracts. It is likely that nerve cells in other parts of the body are similarly affected by dysfunctional mitochondria, resulting in movement problems and hearing loss in some individuals with this condition. "
947,OPN1LW ,"opsin 1, long wave sensitive","The OPN1LW gene provides instructions for making a protein that is essential for normal color vision. This protein is found in the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. The retina contains two types of light receptor cells, called rods and cones, that transmit visual signals from the eye to the brain. Rods provide vision in low light. Cones provide vision in bright light, including color vision. There are three types of cones, each containing a specific pigment (a photopigment called an opsin) that is most sensitive to particular wavelengths of light.The OPN1LW gene provides instructions for making an opsin pigment that is more sensitive to light in the yellow/orange part of the visible spectrum (long-wavelength light). Cones with this pigment are called long-wavelength-sensitive or L cones. In response to light, the photopigment triggers a series of chemical reactions within an L cone. These reactions ultimately alter the cell's electrical charge, generating a signal that is transmitted to the brain. The brain combines input from all three types of cones to produce normal color vision.The OPN1LW gene is located next to another opsin pigment gene, OPN1MW, on the X chromosome. The OPN1MW gene provides instructions for making a photopigment that is more sensitive to light at middle wavelengths (yellow/green light). Most people have one copy of the OPN1LW gene and one or more copies of the OPN1MW gene on each X chromosome. A nearby region of DNA, known as the locus control region (LCR), regulates the activity of these genes. Only the two opsin pigment genes nearest the LCR, generally the OPN1LW gene and the first copy of the OPN1MW gene, are active in the retina and contribute to color vision.","Color vision deficiency Several kinds of genetic changes involving the OPN1LW gene cause red-green color vision defects, a form of color vision deficiency that makes it difficult or impossible to distinguish between shades of red, yellow, and green. Most red-green color vision defects result from structural rearrangements involving the OPN1LW and OPN1MW genes. Because these genes are so similar, they occasionally swap genetic material when the genes are being passed from parent to child. This swapping, called recombination, can ultimately delete genetic material from one or both genes or lead to the formation of a hybrid pigment gene that contains part of the OPN1LW gene and part of the OPN1MW gene. Less commonly, red-green color defects can result from changes in single DNA building blocks (base pairs) in the OPN1LW gene.When OPN1LW gene mutations lead to completely nonfunctional L cones, color vision depends entirely on the other two types of cones. The specific type of red-green color vision deficiency that results from a total loss of L cone function is called protanopia. A less severe red-green color vision defect called protanomaly occurs when a partially functional hybrid pigment gene replaces the normal OPN1LW gene. The photopigments made from these hybrid genes usually have abnormal visual properties that impair red-green color vision.A common variation (polymorphism) in the OPN1LW gene accounts for subtle differences in normal color vision. This change alters a single protein building block (amino acid) in the resulting photopigment, replacing the amino acid serine with the amino acid alanine at position 180 (written as Ser180Ala). Researchers suggest that the Ser180Ala polymorphism also plays a role in determining the severity of color vision loss in people with red-green color vision defects.A rarer form of color vision deficiency, blue cone monochromacy, severely reduces sharpness of vision (visual acuity) and affects the ability to perceive most colors. This condition also includes other vision problems that are not typically found with red-green color vision defects. Blue cone monochromacy occurs when genetic changes prevent the opsin pigments produced from both the OPN1MW and OPN1LW genes from functioning normally. In some cases, the condition is caused by a deletion of the LCR, which normally controls the activity of the OPN1MW and OPN1LW genes. A loss of the LCR prevents the production of pigments from both genes. As a result, people with this condition have only functional cones with short-wavelength-sensitive photopigment (S cones), which leads to reduced visual acuity and poor color vision. The cone abnormalities also underlie the other vision problems in people with blue cone monochromacy. "
948,OPN1MW ,"opsin 1, medium wave sensitive","The OPN1MW gene provides instructions for making a protein that is essential for normal color vision.

Cones with this pigment are called middle-wavelength-sensitive or M cones. In response to light, the photopigment triggers a series of chemical reactions within an M cone. These reactions ultimately alter the cell's electrical charge, generating a signal that is transmitted to the brain. The brain combines input from all three types of cones to produce normal color vision.People can have one or more copies of the OPN1MW gene in each cell. All copies of this gene are located in a row on the X chromosome near another opsin pigment gene, OPN1LW. The OPN1LW gene provides instructions for making a photopigment that is more sensitive to light at long wavelengths (in the orange/red part of the visible spectrum). A nearby region of DNA, known as the locus control region (LCR), regulates the activity of the OPN1MW and OPN1LW genes.

This mutation replaces the amino acid cysteine with the amino acid arginine at position 203 (written as Cys203Arg or C203R).When OPN1MW gene mutations lead to completely nonfunctional M cones, color vision depends entirely on the other two types of cones. The specific type of red-green color vision deficiency that results from a total loss of M cone function is called deuteranopia. A less severe red-green color vision defect called deuteranomaly occurs when a partially functional hybrid pigment gene replaces the normal OPN1MW gene. The photopigments made from these hybrid genes usually have abnormal visual properties that impair red-green color vision.A rarer form of color vision deficiency, blue cone monochromacy, severely reduces sharpness of vision (visual acuity) and affects the ability to perceive most colors.

These reactions ultimately alter the cell's electrical charge, generating a signal that is transmitted to the brain. The brain combines input from all three types of cones to produce normal color vision.","Color vision deficiency At least six mutations in the OPN1SW gene have been found to cause a relatively uncommon form of color vision deficiency called blue-yellow color vision defects or tritan defects. These defects cause problems with differentiating shades of blue and green and cause difficulty distinguishing dark blue from black. Each of the known OPN1SW gene mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the short-wave-sensitive photopigment, which causes the photopigment to be partially or totally nonfunctional. Researchers suggest that S cone cells without functional photopigment die prematurely or cannot transmit visual signals to the brain normally.When OPN1SW gene mutations lead to completely nonfunctional S cones, color vision depends entirely on the other two types of cones. The specific type of blue-yellow color vision deficiency that results from a total loss of S cone function is called tritanopia. A less severe blue-yellow color vision defect called tritanomaly occurs when S cones function abnormally. "
950,OPRM1 ,opioid receptor mu 1,"The OPRM1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called the mu (μ) opioid receptor. Opioid receptors are part of the endogenous opioid system, which is the body's internal system for regulating pain, reward, and addictive behaviors. It consists of opioid substances produced naturally within the body (called endogenous opioids) and their receptors, into which opioids fit like keys into locks. Opioid receptors are found in the nervous system, where they are embedded in the outer membrane of nerve cells (neurons). When opioids attach (bind) to the receptors, the interaction triggers a series of chemical changes within and between neurons that lead to feelings of pleasure and pain relief.The μ opioid receptor was the first opioid receptor to be discovered. It is the primary receptor for endogenous opioids called beta-endorphin and enkephalins, which help regulate the body's response to pain, among other functions. The μ opioid receptor is also the binding site for many opioids introduced from outside the body (called exogenous opioids). These include commonly prescribed pain medications such as oxycodone, fentanyl, buprenorphine, methadone, oxymorphone, hydrocodone, codeine, and morphine, as well as illegal opioid drugs such as heroin.When endogenous or exogenous opioids bind to the μ opioid receptor, the interaction triggers a cascade of chemical signals in the nervous system. These signals reduce the activity (excitability) of neurons in certain areas of the brain, which leads to pain relief and feelings of pleasure and intense happiness (euphoria). In addition, the chemical signaling ultimately increases the production of a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine is a chemical messenger (neurotransmitter) that helps regulate areas of the brain involved in reward-seeking behavior, attention, and mood.",Alcohol use disorder Genetics Home Reference provides information about alcohol use disorder. 
951,ORC1 ,origin recognition complex subunit 1,"The ORC1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is important in the copying of a cell's DNA before the cell divides (a process known as DNA replication). The protein produced from this gene is one of a group of proteins known as the origin recognition complex (ORC). (The complex is made up of the proteins ORC1 to ORC6, which are produced from different genes.) ORC attaches (binds) to certain regions of DNA known as origins of replication (or origins), where the process of DNA copying begins. This complex attracts additional proteins to bind to it, forming a larger group of proteins called the pre-replication complex. When the pre-replication complex is attached to the origin, replication is able to begin at that location. This tightly controlled process, called replication licensing, helps ensure that DNA replication occurs only once per cell division and is required for cells to divide.ORC also attaches to a form of DNA called heterochromatin. Heterochromatin is densely packed DNA that contains few functional genes, but it is important for controlling gene activity and maintaining the structure of chromosomes. It is unclear what effect ORC binding has on heterochromatin.In addition to its roles as part of ORC, the ORC1 protein is involved in the copying of cell structures called centrosomes and centrioles, which are important for the process of cell division. ORC1 blocks centrosomes and centrioles from being copied more than once, which is key to normal cell division. In addition, some research suggests that ORC1 is involved in the function of cilia, which are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. Cilia participate in signaling pathways that transmit information within and between cells and are important for the development and function of many types of cells and tissues, including bone.","Meier-Gorlin syndrome Mutations in the ORC1 gene cause Meier-Gorlin syndrome, a condition characterized by short stature, underdeveloped kneecaps, and small ears. These mutations alter the ORC1 protein, typically by changing single protein building blocks (amino acids) or by leading to production of an abnormally short version of the ORC1 protein. As a result, assembly of the pre-replication complex is impaired, which disrupts replication licensing; however, it is not clear how a reduction in replication licensing leads to Meier-Gorlin syndrome. Researchers speculate that such a reduction delays the cell division process, which slows growth of the bones and other tissues during development and may contribute to the features of the disorder. Some studies suggest that alterations of ORC1 result in too many copies of centrosomes and centrioles, which may also delay cell division. Other studies suggest that changes in ORC1 impair the function of cilia, which may delay development of certain tissues and underlie the abnormal development of kneecaps and ears characteristic of Meier-Gorlin syndrome. "
952,ORC4 ,origin recognition complex subunit 4,"The ORC4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is important in the copying of a cell's DNA before the cell divides (a process known as DNA replication).

These mutations alter the ORC4 protein, typically by changing single protein building blocks (amino acids) or by leading to production of an abnormally short version of the ORC4 protein. The most common ORC4 gene mutation in people with this condition replaces the amino acid tyrosine at position 174 with the amino acid cysteine (written as Tyr174Cys). As a result of these changes, assembly of the pre-replication complex is impaired, which disrupts replication licensing; however, it is not clear how a reduction in replication licensing leads to Meier-Gorlin syndrome. Researchers speculate that such a reduction delays the cell division process, which slows growth of the bones and other tissues during development. It is not known why development of the kneecaps and ears is particularly affected. "
953,ORC6 ,origin recognition complex subunit 6,"The ORC6 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is important in the copying of a cell's DNA before the cell divides (a process known as DNA replication). The protein produced from this gene is one of a group of proteins known as the origin recognition complex (ORC). (The complex is made up of the proteins ORC1 to ORC6, which are produced from different genes.)

One mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the ORC6 protein, replacing the amino acid tyrosine at protein position 232 with the amino acid serine (written as Tyr232Ser). The other gene mutation leads to production of an abnormally short protein. These changes impair assembly of the pre-replication complex, disrupting replication licensing; however, it is not clear how a reduction in replication licensing leads to Meier-Gorlin syndrome. Researchers speculate that such a reduction delays the cell division process, which slows growth of the bones and other tissues during development.

954,OSMR ,oncostatin M receptor,"The OSMR gene provides instructions for making a protein called oncostatin M receptor beta subunit (OSMRβ). This protein is one piece (subunit) of both the oncostatin M (OSM) receptor type II and the interleukin-31 (IL-31) receptor. These receptors are embedded in the cell membrane of many types of cells throughout the body. Each attaches to a particular protein, fitting together like a lock and its key. This attachment triggers a series of chemical signals inside the cell that directs certain cell functions.OSM receptor type II interacts with a protein called oncostatin M (OSM). Signaling triggered by OSM was first recognized to block the growth of cancerous cells and appears to play a role in many other body processes, including the development of blood cells, the maturation of cells to become certain cell types, and an immune system response called inflammation. The signaling may also block the self-destruction (apoptosis) of cells.The IL-31 receptor interacts with a protein called IL-31. Signaling triggered by IL-31 is involved in inflammation and stimulating itching (pruritus), although its role is not completely understood.","Primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis At least 13 mutations in the OSMR gene have been found to cause primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis (PLCA) type 1, an itchy skin condition in which clumps of abnormal proteins called amyloids build up in the skin. These mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in OSMRβ. Most alter a region of the protein thought to interact with the other subunit of the OSM receptor type II or the IL-31 receptor and may impair formation of these receptors.OSMR gene mutations reduce the chemical signals triggered by OSM and IL-31. Researchers speculate that this reduced signaling may make cells more likely to undergo apoptosis. Some studies suggest that apoptosis of skin cells releases abnormal proteins that form amyloids. It has been suggested that apoptosis is triggered by scratching the itchy skin, but the role of OSMR gene changes in skin itching is not clear. "
955,OTC ,ornithine carbamoyltransferase,"The OTC gene provides instructions for making the enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase. This enzyme participates in the urea cycle, a series of reactions that occurs in liver cells. The urea cycle processes excess nitrogen, generated when protein is used by the body, into a compound called urea that is excreted by the kidneys. Excreting the excess nitrogen prevents it from accumulating in the form of ammonia, which is toxic, especially to the nervous system.The specific role of the ornithine transcarbamylase enzyme is to control the reaction in which two compounds, carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine, form a new compound called citrulline.","Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency More than 500 OTC gene mutations have been identified in people with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, an inherited disorder that causes ammonia to accumulate in the blood. Ammonia, which is formed when proteins are broken down in the body, is toxic if the levels become too high. The nervous system is especially sensitive to the effects of excess ammonia.The OTC gene mutations that cause ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency result in an ornithine transcarbamylase enzyme that is shorter than normal or the wrong shape, or prevent any enzyme from being produced. The shape of an enzyme affects its ability to control a chemical reaction. If the ornithine transcarbamylase enzyme is misshapen or missing, it cannot fulfill its role in the urea cycle. Excess nitrogen is not converted to urea for excretion, and ammonia accumulates in the body. Accumulation of ammonia causes neurological problems and other signs and symptoms of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. "
956,OTULIN ,OTU deubiquitinase with linear linkage specificity,"The OTULIN gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps regulate inflammation, which is part of the body's early immune response to foreign invaders. Inflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight the invaders and facilitate tissue repair. Inflammation can be turned on by a cellular process called ubiquitination, in which molecules called ubiquitin are attached to certain proteins. When foreign invaders are recognized, chains of ubiquitin molecules linked end-to-end, called linear ubiquitin chains, are attached to particular proteins. The addition of these chains stimulates signaling pathways that result in inflammation. Once the infection is under control, the body stops the inflammatory response to prevent damage to its own cells and tissues. The OTULIN protein helps control inflammation by removing linear ubiquitin chains.In addition to inflammation, the OTULIN protein is thought to be involved in regulating development before birth and controlling cell death. Researchers are working to understand the protein's role in these processes.","Otulipenia At least three mutations in the OTULIN gene have been found to cause otulipenia, a condition that causes abnormal inflammation in the body, beginning in infancy. Affected babies have recurrent episodes of fever, diarrhea, painful joints, and skin rashes. The gene mutations involved in otulipenia reduce the function of the OTULIN protein. As a result, removal of linear ubiquitin chains is impaired, and signaling pathways that cause inflammation are abnormally active. The excessive inflammation that results causes the signs and symptoms of otulipenia and damages organs in the body; it can be life-threatening if not treated. "
957,OTX2 ,orthodenticle homeobox 2,"The OTX2 gene provides instructions for producing a protein that regulates the activity of other genes. On the basis of this action, the OTX2 protein is called a transcription factor. The OTX2 gene is part of a family of homeobox genes, which act during early embryonic development to control the formation of many body structures.The OTX2 gene plays a critical role in the development of the eyes and related structures, such as the nerves that carry visual information from the eyes to the brain (optic nerves). It is also involved in brain development, including the formation of the pituitary gland at the base of the brain. The pituitary gland produces hormones that help control growth, reproduction, and other critical body functions.","Septo-optic dysplasia At least eight mutations in the OTX2 gene have been identified in people with the major features of septo-optic dysplasia. Some of these mutations prevent the production of a functional OTX2 protein. Other mutations lead to a defective version of the protein that cannot regulate the activity of other genes.A shortage of the OTX2 protein disrupts the formation and early development of the eyes, the optic nerves, the pituitary gland, and other brain structures. These problems with development lead to the major features of septo-optic dysplasia, including eye abnormalities, underdevelopment of the pituitary gland (pituitary hypoplasia), and learning difficulties. However, the signs and symptoms associated with OTX2 gene mutations vary widely, even among affected members of the same family. Additional features that have been reported in people with OTX2 gene mutations include delayed development, slow growth, and seizures.Studies suggest that mutations in the OTX2 gene are a rare cause of septo-optic dysplasia. "
958,OXCT1 ,3-oxoacid CoA-transferase 1,"The OXCT1 gene provides instruction for making an enzyme called succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase, often abbreviated as SCOT. The SCOT enzyme is made in the energy-producing centers of cells (mitochondria). The enzyme plays a role in the breakdown of ketones, which are molecules produced by the liver during the breakdown of fats. Ketones are an important source of energy during prolonged periods without food (fasting) or when energy demands are increased, such as during illness or when exercising. In the processing of ketones, the SCOT enzyme converts the molecule acetoacetate to acetoacetyl-CoA.","Succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase deficiency At least 20 mutations in the OXCT1 gene have been found to cause SCOT deficiency, a condition characterized by episodes of extreme tiredness, appetite loss, and seizures, known as ketoacidotic attacks. Most OXCT1 gene mutations lead to changes in single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SCOT enzyme and result in an enzyme with little or no function. A reduction in the amount of functional enzyme leads to an inability to break down ketones, often resulting in decreased energy production and an elevated level of ketones in the blood. If these signs become severe, a ketoacidotic attack can occur. "
959,PABPN1 ,poly(A) binding protein nuclear 1,"The PABPN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found throughout the body. The PABPN1 protein plays an important role in processing molecules called messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which serve as genetic blueprints for making proteins. The PABPN1 protein attaches (binds) to the end of an mRNA molecule at a region called the polyadenine tail or poly(A) tail. Poly(A) tails consist of many copies of a molecule called adenine, which is one of the building blocks of RNA and its chemical cousin, DNA. Poly(A) tails protect the mRNA from being broken down and allow the mRNA to be transported within the cell. The PABPN1 protein helps add adenines to the poly(A) tail through a process called polyadenylation. PABPN1 also helps transport mRNA out of the nucleus and may be involved in regulating mRNA production and the breakdown of poor quality mRNA.Near the beginning of the PABPN1 protein is an area where 10 copies of the protein building block (amino acid) alanine occur in a row. This stretch of alanines is known as a polyalanine tract. The role of the polyalanine tract in PABPN1 protein function is unknown.","Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy At least 20 different mutations in the PABPN1 gene have been found to cause oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy. This condition is characterized by muscle weakness that begins in adulthood and largely affects the eyelids, throat, shoulders, hips, and legs. The PABPN1 gene mutations that cause this condition usually affect one of the two copies of the gene in each cell and result in a PABPN1 protein with an abnormally long (expanded) polyalanine tract that has 11 to 18 copies of alanine.The age of onset and severity of the condition can be partly explained by the mutation. Most affected individuals have polyalanine tracts that are 13 alanines long and tend to develop muscle weakness in their sixties. Individuals with PABPN1 proteins that contain polyalanine tracts containing 16 to 18 copies of alanine often begin to experience muscle weakness in their forties or fifties. Individuals who have a polyalanine tract mutation containing 11 alanines tend to develop signs and symptom of the condition in their seventies. Some individuals have mutations in both copies of the PABPN1 gene that lead to expanded polyalanine tracts. These individuals often develop muscle weakness in their thirties or forties and may have disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy) and neurological problems.The extra alanines cause the PABPN1 protein to form nonfunctional clumps within muscle cells. These clumps (called intranuclear inclusions) accumulate and are thought to impair the normal functioning of muscle cells, eventually causing cell death. The loss of muscle cells over time most likely causes the muscle weakness seen in people with oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy. In severe cases, it is likely that intranuclear inclusions affect nerve cells as well as muscle cells. "
960,PACS1 ,phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 1,"The PACS1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 1 (PACS1). The PACS1 protein is found in a complex network of membranes known as the trans-Golgi network, which sorts proteins and other molecules and sends them to their intended destinations inside or outside the cell. Within the trans-Golgi network, this protein helps transport certain molecules and proteins. The PACS1 protein is most active during development before birth.","PACS1 syndrome At least two mutations in the PACS1 gene have been found to cause PACS1 syndrome. This condition is characterized by intellectual disability, speech and language problems, and a distinct facial appearance. Many affected individuals have additional neurological, behavioral, and health problems. The most common mutation, which occurs in nearly everyone with PACS1 syndrome, results in the production of a protein with the protein building block (amino acid) arginine replaced with the amino acid tryptophan at position 203 (written as Arg203Trp or R203W).PACS1 gene mutations are thought to impair the protein's ability to aid in the transport of molecules and proteins. Such an impairment likely results in the accumulation or misplacement of these substances within cells. The accumulated molecules and proteins may interfere with the function of the protein produced from the normal copy of the PACS1 gene, further disrupting the placement of these substances.Research suggests that impaired PACS1 protein function disrupts normal development of structures in the face, leading to a distinct facial appearance. It is likely that the development of other body systems are similarly affected by impaired PACS1 protein function, leading to other signs and symptoms of PACS1 syndrome, but more research is needed to understand the mechanisms. "
961,PADI3 ,peptidyl arginine deiminase 3,"The PADI3 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called peptidylarginine deiminase type III. This enzyme modifies proteins by changing certain protein building blocks (amino acids). Specifically, it changes the positively charged amino acid arginine to the neutral amino acid citrulline when positively charged calcium atoms (ions) are present. This process is called deimination. In most cases, deimination alters the protein's interactions with other proteins.Peptidylarginine deiminase type III is found in the skin's tough outer surface (the stratum corneum), within cells called keratinocytes. The protein also functions in hair follicles, which are specialized structures in the skin where hair growth occurs. In hair follicles, peptidylarginine deiminase type III modifies proteins involved in giving structure to the hair strand (shaft).","Uncombable hair syndrome At least nine mutations in the PADI3 gene have been found to cause uncombable hair syndrome. This condition is characterized by dry, frizzy, blond scalp hair that cannot be combed flat. This condition usually improves over time, and by adolescence individuals with uncombable hair syndrome have hair that lies flat and has normal or nearly normal texture.The PADI3 gene mutations likely result in a peptidylarginine deiminase type III enzyme with little or no activity. As a result, the enzyme cannot deiminate other proteins. In particular, peptidylarginine deiminase type III cannot deiminate a protein within the hair shaft called trichohyalin. Trichohyalin needs this modification so that it can attach (bind) to other proteins, giving the hair shaft its cylindrical shape. Without deimination of trichohyalin, the cross-section of the hair shaft becomes triangular, heart-like, or flat. These angular hair shafts result in frizzy hair that will not lie flat, which is typical of uncombable hair syndrome. "
962,PAFAH1B1 ,platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase 1b regulatory subunit 1,"The PAFAH1B1 gene (also known as LIS1) provides instructions for making a protein that is one part (subunit) of a complex called platelet activating factor acetyl hydrolase 1B (PAFAH1B). This complex regulates the amount of a molecule called platelet activating factor (PAF) in the brain. PAF is thought to be involved in directing the movement (migration) of nerve cells (neurons), a process known as neuronal migration. Proper neuronal migration is essential for normal brain development and function.Separate from its role in the PAFAH1B complex, the PAFAH1B1 protein is also likely involved in the organization of the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton). This protein interacts with microtubules and regulates the activity of a variety of proteins that are involved in their function. Microtubules are rigid, hollow fibers that make up the cytoskeleton, and they are involved in cell division and movement","Isolated lissencephaly sequence At least 120 mutations in the PAFAH1B1 gene have been found to cause isolated lissencephaly sequence (ILS). This condition is characterized by abnormal brain development that results in the brain having a smooth surface (lissencephaly) instead of its normal folds and grooves. Individuals with ILS have severe neurological problems, including severe intellectual disability and recurrent seizures (epilepsy) that begin in infancy. Most of the PAFAH1B1 gene mutations that cause ILS lead to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the PAFAH1B1 protein. PAFAH1B1 gene mutations account for more than half of all ILS cases.PAFAH1B1 gene mutations cause PAF levels to be reduced and impair the normal function of microtubules. As a result, neurons in the developing brain cannot migrate to their proper location, which impairs brain development and leads to the severe neurological problems characteristic of ILS. "
963,PAH ,phenylalanine hydroxylase,"The PAH gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is responsible for the first step in processing phenylalanine, which is a building block of proteins (an amino acid) obtained through the diet. Phenylalanine is found in all proteins and in some artificial sweeteners.Phenylalanine hydroxylase is responsible for the conversion of phenylalanine to another amino acid, tyrosine. The enzyme works with a molecule called tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) to carry out this chemical reaction. Tyrosine is used to make several types of hormones, certain chemicals that transmit signals in the brain (neurotransmitters), and a pigment called melanin, which gives hair and skin their color. Tyrosine can also be broken down into smaller molecules that are used to produce energy.","Phenylketonuria More than 500 mutations in the PAH gene have been identified in people with phenylketonuria (PKU). Most of these mutations change single amino acids in phenylalanine hydroxylase. For example, the most common mutation in many populations replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid tryptophan at position 408 (written as Arg408Trp or R408W). Other PAH mutations delete small amounts of DNA from the gene or disrupt the way the gene's instructions are used to make phenylalanine hydroxylase.PAH mutations reduce the activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase, preventing it from processing phenylalanine effectively. As a result, this amino acid can build up to toxic levels in the blood and other tissues. Because nerve cells in the brain are particularly sensitive to phenylalanine levels, excessive amounts of this substance can cause brain damage.Classic PKU, the most severe form of the disorder, occurs when phenylalanine hydroxylase activity is severely reduced or absent. People with untreated classic PKU have levels of phenylalanine high enough to cause severe brain damage and other serious medical problems. Mutations in the PAH gene that allow the enzyme to retain some activity result in milder versions of this condition, such as variant PKU or non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia. "
964,PANK2 ,pantothenate kinase 2,"The PANK2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called pantothenate kinase 2. This enzyme is active in specialized cellular structures called mitochondria, which are the cell's energy-producing centers. Within mitochondria, pantothenate kinase 2 regulates the formation of a molecule called coenzyme A. Coenzyme A is found in all living cells, where it is essential for the body's production of energy from carbohydrates, fats, and some protein building blocks (amino acids).PANK2 is one of four human genes that provide instructions for making versions of pantothenate kinase. The functions of these different versions probably vary among tissue types and parts of the cell. The version produced by the PANK2 gene is active in cells throughout the body, including nerve cells in the brain.","Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration About 100 mutations in the PANK2 gene have been identified in people with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. Typically, people with the more severe, early-onset form of the disorder have PANK2 mutations that prevent cells from producing any functional pantothenate kinase 2. People affected by the atypical, later-onset form usually have mutations that change single amino acids in the enzyme, which makes the enzyme unstable or disrupts its activity. In some cases, single amino acid changes allow the enzyme to retain some function. The most common PANK2 mutation replaces the amino acid glycine with the amino acid arginine at position 411 of the enzyme (written as Gly411Arg or G411R).When pantothenate kinase 2 is altered or missing, the normal production of coenzyme A is disrupted and potentially harmful compounds can build up in the brain. This buildup leads to swelling, tissue damage, and an abnormal accumulation of iron in certain areas of the brain. Researchers are uncertain how a lack of functional pantothenate kinase 2 causes the specific features of pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. Because the enzyme functions in mitochondria, the signs and symptoms of this condition may be related to impaired energy production.Mutations in the PANK2 gene are also found in people with a condition called HARP (hypoprebetalipoproteinemia, acanthocytosis, retinitis pigmentosa, and pallidal degeneration). HARP was historically described as a separate syndrome but is now considered part of pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. Although HARP is much rarer than classic pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, both conditions involve problems with movement, dementia, and vision abnormalities. "
965,PARK7 ,Parkinsonism associated deglycase,"The PARK7 gene provides instructions for making the DJ-1 protein. This protein is found in many tissues and organs, including the brain. Studies indicate that the DJ-1 protein has several functions, although none are fully understood. One of the protein's functions may be to help protect cells, particularly brain cells, from oxidative stress. Oxidative stress occurs when unstable molecules called free radicals accumulate to levels that can damage or kill cells. Additionally, the DJ-1 protein may serve as a chaperone molecule that helps fold newly produced proteins into the proper 3-dimensional shape and helps refold damaged proteins. Like other chaperone molecules, the DJ-1 protein may assist in delivering selected proteins to proteasomes, which are structures within cells that break down unneeded molecules. Researchers suggest that the DJ-1 protein may also play a role in activities that produce and process RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA.","Parkinson disease Researchers have identified more than 25 PARK7 gene mutations that can cause Parkinson disease, a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement and balance. These mutations are associated with the early-onset form of the disorder, which begins before age 50. Some PARK7 gene mutations lead to an abnormally small DJ-1 protein or change the building blocks (amino acids) used to make the protein. The altered protein is unstable and does not function properly, if at all. Other mutations delete a large portion of the PARK7 gene, preventing the production of any functional DJ-1 protein.It is unclear how loss of functional DJ-1 protein leads to Parkinson disease. Some studies suggest that PARK7 gene mutations disrupt the protein's chaperone function, which leads to a toxic buildup of misfolded or damaged proteins and eventually to cell death. Another possibility is that PARK7 gene mutations impair the protein's ability to protect cells from destructive oxidative stress. Nerve cells that make the chemical messenger dopamine are particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress. With diminished protection, free radicals may cause enough damage to kill these nerve cells. Progressive loss of dopamine-producing nerve cells is a characteristic feature of Parkinson disease. The death of these cells weakens communication between the brain and muscles, and ultimately the brain becomes unable to control muscle movement. "
966,PAX2 ,paired box 2,"The PAX2 gene belongs to a family of genes that plays a critical role in the formation of tissues and organs during embryonic development. The members of the PAX gene family are also important for maintaining the normal function of certain cells after birth. To carry out these roles, the PAX genes provide instructions for making proteins that attach to specific areas of DNA and help control the activity (expression) of particular genes. On the basis of this action, PAX proteins are called transcription factors.During embryonic development, the PAX2 gene provides instructions for producing a protein that is involved in the formation of the eyes, ears, brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), kidneys, urinary tract, and genital tract. After birth, the PAX2 protein is thought to protect against cell death during periods of cellular stress.","Renal coloboma syndrome More than 40 mutations in the PAX2 gene have been found to cause renal coloboma syndrome. Most mutations are specific to each affected family; however, one mutation has been found in multiple affected individuals. This mutation inserts one DNA building block (nucleotide) into the PAX2 gene (written as 619insG). Most mutations occur in the region of the protein that attaches to DNA, impairing its function as a transcription factor. A lack of functional PAX2 protein disrupts the formation of certain tissues (particularly the kidneys and eyes) during embryonic development, causing the signs and symptoms of renal coloboma syndrome. "
967,PAX3 ,paired box 3,"The PAX3 gene belongs to a family of PAX genes that plays a critical role in the formation of tissues and organs during embryonic development. The PAX gene family is also important for maintaining the normal function of certain cells after birth. To carry out these roles, the PAX genes provide instructions for making proteins that attach (bind) to specific areas of DNA. By attaching to critical DNA regions, PAX proteins help control the activity of particular genes. On the basis of this action, PAX proteins are called transcription factors.During embryonic development, the PAX3 gene is active in cells called neural crest cells. These cells migrate from the developing spinal cord to specific regions in the embryo. The protein made from the PAX3 gene directs the activity of other genes that signal neural crest cells to form specialized tissues or cell types such as some nerve tissue and pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. Melanocytes produce the pigment melanin, which contributes to hair, eye, and skin color. Melanocytes are also found in certain regions of the brain and inner ear.Studies suggest that the PAX3 protein is also necessary for the normal development of bones in the face and skull (craniofacial bones) and elsewhere in the body, and for the formation of muscle tissue (myogenesis).","Craniofacial-deafness-hand syndrome At least one PAX3 gene mutation has been identified in individuals with craniofacial-deafness-hand syndrome, a condition characterized by distinctive facial features, profound hearing loss, and abnormalities of the hand muscles that can restrict movement. The mutation replaces a single protein building block (amino acid) called asparagine with another amino acid called lysine at position 47 in the PAX3 protein (written as Asn47Lys or N47K). This mutation appears to affect the ability of the PAX3 protein to bind to DNA. As a result, the PAX3 protein cannot control the activity of other genes and cannot direct the neural crest cells to form specialized tissues. A lack of specialization of neural crest cells leads to the impaired growth of craniofacial bones, nerve tissue, and muscles seen in craniofacial-deafness-hand syndrome. "
968,PAX6 ,paired box 6,"The PAX6 gene belongs to a family of genes that play a critical role in the formation of tissues and organs during embryonic development. The members of the PAX gene family are also important for maintaining the normal function of certain cells after birth. To carry out these roles, the PAX genes provide instructions for making proteins that attach to specific areas of DNA and help control the activity (expression) of particular genes. On the basis of this action, PAX proteins are called transcription factors.During embryonic development, the PAX6 protein is thought to turn on (activate) genes involved in the formation of the eyes, the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), and the pancreas. Within the brain, the PAX6 protein is involved in the development of a specialized group of brain cells that process smell (the olfactory bulb). Additionally, researchers believe that the PAX6 protein controls many aspects of eye development before birth. After birth, the PAX6 protein likely regulates the expression of various genes in many structures of the eyes.","Aniridia More than 280 mutations in the PAX6 gene have been found to cause aniridia, which is an absence of the colored part of the eye (the iris). Most of these mutations create a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the PAX6 protein and lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein. As a result, there is less PAX6 protein to regulate the activity of other genes.The majority of mutations that cause aniridia occur within the PAX6 gene; however, some disease-causing mutations occur in neighboring regions of DNA that normally regulate the expression of the PAX6 gene, known as regulatory regions. Mutations in PAX6 gene regulatory regions reduce the expression of the PAX6 gene. These mutations lead to a shortage of functional PAX6 protein, which disrupts the formation of the eyes during development. "
969,PAX8 ,paired box 8,"The PAX8 gene belongs to a family of genes that play critical roles in the formation of tissues and organs during embryonic development. The PAX gene family is also important for maintaining the normal function of certain cells after birth. To carry out these roles, the PAX genes provide instructions for making proteins that attach to specific areas of DNA. By attaching to critical DNA regions, these proteins help control the activity of particular genes (gene expression). On the basis of this action, PAX proteins are called transcription factors.During embryonic development, the PAX8 protein is thought to activate genes involved in the formation of the kidney and the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped tissue in the lower neck. It releases hormones that play an important role in regulating growth, brain development, and the rate of chemical reactions in the body (metabolism). Following birth, the PAX8 protein regulates several genes involved in the production of thyroid hormones.","Congenital hypothyroidism At least 15 mutations in this gene cause congenital hypothyroidism, a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of thyroid hormones starting from birth. Other PAX8 gene mutations only mildly reduce thyroid hormone levels or have no detectable effect. Sometimes, identical mutations in members of the same family have different effects.Most mutations change one of the building blocks (amino acids) used to make the PAX8 protein. Other mutations disrupt protein production, resulting in an abnormally small version of the PAX8 protein. Nearly all PAX8 gene mutations prevent the PAX8 protein from effectively binding to DNA. One mutation alters interactions between the PAX8 protein and other transcription factors. As a result, the PAX8 protein cannot perform its role in regulating the activity of certain genes.The thyroid gland is unusually small in people with PAX8 gene mutations. This finding suggests that PAX8 gene mutations disrupt the normal growth or survival of thyroid cells during embryonic development. As a result, the thyroid gland is reduced in size and may be unable to produce the normal amount of thyroid hormones. Because cases caused by PAX8 gene mutations are due to a problem with development of the thyroid gland, they are classified as thyroid dysgenesis. "
970,PC ,pyruvate carboxylase,"The PC gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called pyruvate carboxylase. This enzyme is active in mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers within cells.Pyruvate carboxylase is responsible for a chemical reaction that converts a molecule called pyruvate to another molecule called oxaloacetate. This reaction is essential for several different cellular functions. In the kidneys and liver, it is the first step in a process called gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis generates glucose, a simple sugar that is the body's main energy source. This chemical reaction also occurs in the pancreas, where it helps regulate the secretion of a hormone called insulin. Insulin controls the amount of glucose in the blood that is passed into cells for conversion to energy.In fat-storing (adipose) tissue, pyruvate carboxylase is involved in the formation of certain fats (lipogenesis). This enzyme also plays an important role in the nervous system, where it replenishes the building blocks needed to make brain chemicals called neurotransmitters. Additionally, pyruvate carboxylase is necessary for the formation of myelin, which is the fatty covering that insulates and protects certain nerve cells.","Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency More than 30 mutations in the PC gene have been identified in people with pyruvate carboxylase deficiency. This condition causes lactic acid and other potentially toxic compounds to accumulate in the blood. High levels of these substances can damage the body's organs and tissues, particularly in the nervous system.Most PC gene mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in pyruvate carboxylase, which reduces the amount of this enzyme in cells or disrupts its ability to effectively convert pyruvate to oxaloacetate. Other genetic changes lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the enzyme that is completely nonfunctional.If pyruvate carboxylase is missing or altered, it cannot carry out its role in generating glucose. Any disruption in gluconeogenesis impairs the body's ability to make energy in mitochondria. Additionally, a loss of pyruvate carboxylase allows lactic acid and ammonia, among other compounds, to build up and damage organs and tissues. Researchers suggest that the loss of pyruvate carboxylase function in the nervous system, particularly the role of the enzyme in myelin formation and neurotransmitter production, also contributes to the neurologic features of pyruvate carboxylase deficiency. "
971,PCBD1 ,pterin-4 alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase 1,"The PCBD1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called pterin-4 alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase. This enzyme helps carry out one step in the chemical pathway that recycles a molecule called tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4).Tetrahydrobiopterin plays a critical role in processing several protein building blocks (amino acids) in the body. For example, it works with the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase to convert an amino acid called phenylalanine into another amino acid, tyrosine. Tetrahydrobiopterin is also involved in reactions that produce chemicals called neurotransmitters, which transmit signals between nerve cells in the brain. Because it helps enzymes carry out chemical reactions, tetrahydrobiopterin is known as a cofactor.When tetrahydrobiopterin interacts with enzymes during chemical reactions, the cofactor is altered and must be recycled to a usable form. Pterin-4 alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase is one of two enzymes that help recycle tetrahydrobiopterin in the body.","Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency At least nine mutations in the PCBD1 gene have been found to cause tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency. When this condition results from PCBD1 gene mutations, it is known as pterin-4 alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD) deficiency. PCD deficiency accounts for about 5 percent of all cases of tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency.Some mutations in the PCBD1 gene change single amino acids in pterin-4 alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase, while other mutations introduce a premature stop signal in the instructions for making this enzyme. Changes in pterin-4 alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase reduce the enzyme's activity, which affects the body's ability to recycle tetrahydrobiopterin. As a result, less of this cofactor is available to participate in chemical reactions such as the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. If phenylalanine is not converted to tyrosine, the excess can build up in the bloodstream and other tissues.Although people with PCD deficiency usually have elevated levels of phenylalanine in the blood, this form of tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency rarely causes significant medical problems. Researchers believe that other enzymes may compensate for the reduced activity of pterin-4 alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase in people with PCBD1 gene mutations. "
972,PCCA ,propionyl-CoA carboxylase subunit alpha,"The PCCA gene provides instructions for making part of an enzyme called propionyl-CoA carboxylase, specifically, the alpha subunit of this enzyme. Six alpha subunits come together with six beta subunits (produced from the PCCB gene) to form a functioning enzyme. The alpha subunit also includes a region for binding to the B vitamin biotin.Propionyl-CoA carboxylase plays a role in the normal processing of proteins. It carries out a particular step in the breakdown of several protein building blocks (amino acids) called isoleucine, methionine, threonine, and valine. Propionyl-CoA carboxylase also helps break down certain types of lipids (fats) and cholesterol. First, several chemical reactions convert the amino acids, lipids, or cholesterol to a molecule called propionyl-CoA. Using biotin, propionyl-CoA carboxylase then converts propionyl-CoA to a molecule called methylmalonyl-CoA. Additional enzymes break down methylmalonyl-CoA into other molecules that are used for energy.","Propionic acidemia More than 120 mutations in the PCCA gene have been identified in people with propionic acidemia, a condition that causes severe health problems appearing shortly after birth. These mutations include changes in single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) and insertions or deletions of genetic material in the PCCA gene. PCCA mutations prevent the production of functional propionyl-CoA carboxylase or reduce the enzyme's activity. The altered or missing enzyme is unable to process certain parts of proteins and lipids properly. As a result, propionyl-CoA and other potentially harmful compounds can build up to toxic levels in the body. This buildup damages the brain and nervous system, causing the serious health problems associated with propionic acidemia. "
973,PCCB ,propionyl-CoA carboxylase subunit beta,"The PCCB gene provides instructions for making part of an enzyme called propionyl-CoA carboxylase, specifically, the beta subunit of this enzyme. Six beta subunits come together with six alpha subunits (produced from the PCCA gene) to form a functioning enzyme.Propionyl-CoA carboxylase plays a role in the normal processing of proteins. It carries out a particular step in the breakdown of several protein building blocks (amino acids) called isoleucine, methionine, threonine, and valine. Propionyl-CoA carboxylase also helps break down certain types of lipids (fats) and cholesterol. First, several chemical reactions convert the amino acids, lipids, or cholesterol to a molecule called propionyl-CoA. Using the B vitamin biotin, propionyl-CoA carboxylase then converts propionyl-CoA to a molecule called methylmalonyl-CoA. Additional enzymes break down methylmalonyl-CoA into other molecules that are used for energy.","Propionic acidemia More than 100 mutations in the PCCB gene have been identified in people with propionic acidemia, a condition that causes severe health problems appearing shortly after birth. These mutations include changes in single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) and insertions or deletions of genetic material in the PCCB gene. PCCB mutations prevent the production of functional propionyl-CoA carboxylase or reduce the enzyme's activity. The altered or missing enzyme prevents certain parts of proteins and lipids from being broken down properly. As a result, propionyl-CoA and other potentially toxic compounds can build up to toxic levels in the body. This buildup damages the brain and nervous system, causing the serious health problems associated with propionic acidemia. "
974,PCNT ,pericentrin,"The PCNT gene provides instructions for making a protein called pericentrin. Within cells, this protein is located in structures called centrosomes. Centrosomes play a role in cell division and the assembly of microtubules. Microtubules are fibers that help cells maintain their shape, assist in the process of cell division, and are essential for the transport of materials within cells.Pericentrin acts as an anchoring protein, securing proteins to the centrosome that are necessary for its function. Through its interactions with these proteins, pericentrin is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, which is the cell's way of replicating itself in an organized, step-by-step fashion.","Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II At least 30 mutations in the PCNT gene have been found to cause microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (MOPDII). These mutations result in the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional pericentrin protein that cannot anchor other proteins to the centrosome. As a result, centrosomes cannot properly assemble microtubules, leading to disruption of the cell cycle and cell division. Impaired cell division causes a reduction in cell production, while disruption of the cell cycle can lead to cell death. This overall reduction in the number of cells leads to short bones, microcephaly, and the other signs and symptoms of MOPDII. "
975,PCSK9 ,proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9,"The PCSK9 gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps regulate the amount of cholesterol in the bloodstream. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is produced in the body and obtained from foods that come from animals.The PCSK9 protein controls the number of low-density lipoprotein receptors, which are proteins on the surface of cells. These receptors play a critical role in regulating blood cholesterol levels. The receptors bind to particles called low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), which are the primary carriers of cholesterol in the blood. Low-density lipoprotein receptors are particularly abundant in the liver, the organ responsible for removing most excess cholesterol from the body.The number of low-density lipoprotein receptors on the surface of liver cells determines how quickly cholesterol is removed from the bloodstream. The PCSK9 protein breaks down low-density lipoprotein receptors before they reach the cell surface, so more cholesterol can remain in the bloodstream.","Familial hypercholesterolemia Researchers have identified more than 50 PCSK9 gene mutations that cause familial hypercholesterolemia. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the PCSK9 protein. Researchers describe the mutations responsible for familial hypercholesterolemia as ""gain-of-function"" because they appear to enhance the activity of the PCSK9 protein.The enhanced activity of the altered PCSK9 protein causes low-density lipoprotein receptors to be broken down more quickly than usual, reducing the number of receptors on the surface of liver cells. With fewer receptors to remove LDLs from the blood, people with gain-of-function mutations in the PCSK9 gene have very high blood cholesterol levels. As the excess cholesterol circulates through the bloodstream, it is deposited abnormally in tissues such as the skin, tendons, and arteries that supply blood to the heart (coronary arteries). A buildup of cholesterol in the walls of coronary arteries greatly increases a person's risk of having a heart attack.Most people with familial hypercholesterolemia inherit one altered copy of the PCSK9 gene from an affected parent and one normal copy of the gene from the other parent. These cases are associated with an increased risk of early heart disease, typically beginning in a person's forties or fifties. Rarely, a person with familial hypercholesterolemia is born with two mutated copies of the PCSK9 gene. This situation occurs when the person has two affected parents, each of whom passes on one altered copy of the gene. The presence of two PCSK9 gene mutations results in a more severe form of hypercholesterolemia that usually appears in childhood. "
976,PDCD10 ,programmed cell death 10,"The PDCD10 gene (also known as CCM3) provides instructions for making a protein that appears to play a role in the structure of blood vessels. While the exact function of the PDCD10 protein is unclear, studies suggest that it works with other proteins to help strengthen the interactions between cells and limit leakage from blood vessels. This protein is also thought to be involved in pathways that signal cells to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis) when they have completed a certain number of cell divisions or accumulated errors in their DNA.","Cerebral cavernous malformation More than a dozen mutations in the PDCD10 gene have been identified in families with cerebral cavernous malformations, which are collections of blood vessels in the brain that are weak and prone to leakage. These mutations include a deletion of the entire gene, deletion of small segments of DNA, and changes in single DNA building blocks (nucleotides). These mutations result in an abnormal or absent PDCD10 protein. It is unclear how mutations in the PDCD10 gene lead to the formation of cerebral cavernous malformations.Mutations in the PDCD10 gene account for approximately 10 percent of familial cerebral cavernous malformation cases. "
977,PDE6B ,phosphodiesterase 6B,"The PDE6B gene provides instructions for making a protein that is one part (the beta subunit) of a protein complex called cGMP-PDE. This complex is found in specialized light receptor cells called rods. As part of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina), rods transmit visual signals from the eye to the brain specifically in low-light conditions.When light enters the eye, a series of rod cell proteins are turned on (activated), including cGMP-PDE. When cGMP-PDE is active, molecules called GMP within the rod cell are broken down, which triggers channels on the cell membrane to close. The closing of these channels results in the transmission of signals to the brain, which are interpreted as vision.","Autosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness At least one mutation in the PDE6B gene has been found to cause autosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness, which is characterized by the inability to see in low light. This mutation changes the protein building block (amino acid) histidine to the amino acid asparagine at position 258 in the beta subunit (written as His258Asp or H258N). This change impairs the normal function of the cGMP-PDE complex, causing it to be constantly turned on (constitutively active). Because the cGMP-PDE complex is always active, the signals that rod cells send to the brain are constantly occurring, even in bright light. Visual information from rod cells is then perceived by the brain as not meaningful, resulting in night blindness. "
978,PDE6C ,phosphodiesterase 6C,"The PDE6C gene provides instructions for making one part (called the alpha-prime subunit) of an enzyme called cone-specific phosphodiesterase. This enzyme is found exclusively in light-detecting (photoreceptor) cells called cones, which are located in a specialized tissue at the back of the eye known as the retina. Cones provide vision in bright light (daylight vision), including color vision. Other photoreceptor cells, called rods, provide vision in low light (night vision).When light enters the eye, it stimulates specialized pigments in photoreceptor cells. This stimulation triggers a series of chemical reactions that produce an electrical signal, which is interpreted by the brain as vision. This process is called phototransduction. Cone-specific phosphodiesterase carries out one of the reactions in this process. Specifically, the enzyme converts a molecule called cGMP to another molecule, 5'-GMP, in cones. This conversion causes certain channels on the cell membrane to close. The closing of these channels triggers the transmission of visual signals to the brain.","Achromatopsia At least 19 mutations in the PDE6C gene have been found to cause the vision disorder achromatopsia. These mutations underlie a relatively small percentage of cases of complete achromatopsia, a form of the disorder characterized by a total lack of color vision and other vision problems that are present from early infancy. PDE6C gene mutations have also been identified in a few individuals with incomplete achromatopsia, a milder form of the disorder associated with limited color vision.The PDE6C gene mutations associated with achromatopsia affect the function of the alpha-prime subunit. The mutations that underlie complete achromatopsia essentially eliminate the activity of cone-specific phosphodiesterase. Impairment of this enzyme disrupts the process of phototransduction in cones; rods are typically unaffected. Because cones are needed for color vision, people with complete achromatopsia can see only black, white, and shades of gray. They also have other vision problems related to malfunctioning cones, including reduced sharpness (low visual acuity), an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), and involuntary back-and-forth eye movements (nystagmus).Mutations in the PDE6C gene that reduce but do not eliminate the activity of cone-specific phosphodiesterase cause incomplete achromatopsia. People with incomplete achromatopsia have similar but less severe vision problems than people with complete achromatopsia, and they retain some color vision. "
979,PDE6H ,phosphodiesterase 6H,"The PDE6H gene provides instructions for making one part (called the inhibitory gamma subunit) of an enzyme called cone-specific phosphodiesterase. This enzyme is found exclusively in light-detecting (photoreceptor) cells called cones, which are located in a specialized tissue at the back of the eye known as the retina. Cones provide vision in bright light (daylight vision), including color vision. Other photoreceptor cells, called rods, provide vision in low light (night vision).When light enters the eye, it stimulates specialized pigments in photoreceptor cells. This stimulation triggers a series of chemical reactions that produce an electrical signal, which is interpreted by the brain as vision. This process is called phototransduction. Cone-specific phosphodiesterase carries out one of the reactions in this process. Specifically, the enzyme converts a molecule called cGMP to another molecule, 5'-GMP, in cones. This conversion causes certain channels on the cell membrane to close. The closing of these channels triggers the transmission of visual signals to the brain.","Achromatopsia At least one mutation in the PDE6H gene has been found to cause the vision disorder achromatopsia. It is a very rare cause of a form of the disorder called incomplete achromatopsia. This condition is characterized by limited color vision and other vision problems that are present from early infancy.The identified mutation replaces one protein building block (amino acid) near the beginning of the inhibitory gamma subunit with a signal to stop protein production. This mutation is written as Ser12Ter or S12X. This change prevents the production of any functional inhibitory gamma subunit, which interferes with the normal function of cone-specific phosphodiesterase. Impairment of this enzyme disrupts the process of phototransduction in cones; rods are typically unaffected.Because cones are needed for color vision, affected individuals have difficulty distinguishing certain colors. Their other vision problems are also related to the malfunctioning cones. "
980,PDGFB ,platelet derived growth factor subunit B,"The PDGFB gene provides instructions for making one version (isoform) of the platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) protein. This protein is involved in many cellular processes, including cell growth and division (proliferation), maturation (differentiation), and movement. The PDGFB gene provides instructions for a precursor protein that must be processed to be able to perform its function. Before processing, the precursor PDGFB protein attaches (binds) to another PDGFB protein or a similar protein called the PDGFA precursor protein, forming a structure known as a dimer. Once the dimer is formed, the precursor proteins are processed by being cut at specific locations, which forms the functional (active) PDGF proteins, called PDGF-BB and PDGF-AB.The active PDGF-BB or PDGF-AB protein binds to a PDGF receptor, which initiates cellular signaling. PDGF signaling activates many pathways important in cell proliferation, differentiation, and movement.","Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, a rare type of cancer that causes a tumor in the deep layers of skin, is characterized by a somatic mutation involving the PDGFB gene. Somatic mutations are not inherited, but are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is associated with a rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 17 and 22. This translocation, written as t(17;22), fuses part of the PDGFB gene on chromosome 22 with part of another gene on chromosome 17 called COL1A1. The translocation is found on one or more extra chromosomes that can be either the normal linear shape or circular. The resulting combined (fusion) gene is called COL1A1-PDGFB.The COL1A1-PDGFB fusion gene provides instructions for making a fusion protein. In the translocation, the PDGFB gene loses the part of its DNA that inhibits its activity, and production of the COL1A1-PDGFB fusion protein is controlled by COL1A1 gene sequences. As a result, the gene fusion leads to the production of large amounts of the fusion protein. The COL1A1-PDGFB protein forms a dimer and is processed like the normal PDGFB precursor protein. Processing removes the COL1A1 portion, which forms a protein that researchers believe functions like the active PDGF-BB protein. Excess PDGF-BB protein abnormally stimulates cells to proliferate and differentiate, leading to the tumor formation seen in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. "
981,PDGFRA ,platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha,"The PDGFRA gene provides instructions for making a protein called platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), which is part of a family of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Receptor tyrosine kinases transmit signals from the cell surface into the cell through a process called signal transduction. The PDGFRA protein is found in the cell membrane of certain cell types where a specific protein, called platelet-derived growth factor, attaches (binds) to it. This binding turns on (activates) the PDGFRA protein, which then activates other proteins inside the cell by adding a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) at specific positions (a process called phosphorylation). This process leads to the activation of a series of proteins in multiple signaling pathways.The signaling pathways stimulated by the PDGFRA protein control many important cellular processes such as cell growth and division (proliferation) and cell survival. PDGFRA protein signaling is important for the development of many types of cells throughout the body.","PDGFRA-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia Genetic abnormalities that involve the PDGFRA gene cause a type of blood cell cancer called PDGFRA-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia. This condition is characterized by an increased number of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell involved in allergic reactions. These genetic abnormalities are somatic mutations, which are mutations acquired during a person's lifetime that are present only in certain cells. The most common of these genetic abnormalities is a deletion of genetic material from chromosome 4 that brings together parts of two genes, FIP1L1 and PDGFRA, creating the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene. Occasionally, genes other than FIP1L1 are fused with the PDGFRA gene. Mutations that change single DNA building blocks in the PDGFRA gene (point mutations) can also cause this condition, although these mutations are seen very rarely.The protein produced from the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene (as well as other PDGFRA fusion genes) has the function of the PDGFRA protein. However, unlike the normal PDGFRA protein, the fusion protein does not require binding of the platelet-derived growth factor protein to be activated. Similarly, point mutations in the PDGFRA gene can result in a PDGFRA protein that is activated without ligand binding. As a result, the signaling pathways are constantly turned on (constitutively activated), which increases the proliferation and survival of cells. When the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene mutation or point mutations in the PDGFRA gene occur in early blood cells, the growth of eosinophils (and occasionally other blood cells) is poorly controlled, leading to PDGFRA-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia. It is unclear why eosinophils are preferentially affected by this genetic change. "
982,PDGFRB ,platelet derived growth factor receptor beta,"The PDGFRB gene provides instructions for making a protein called platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ), which is part of a family of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases. Receptor tyrosine kinases transmit signals from the cell surface into the cell through a process called signal transduction. The PDGFRβ protein is found in the cell membrane of certain cell types, where a protein called platelet-derived growth factor attaches (binds) to it. This binding turns on (activates) the PDGFRβ protein, which then activates other proteins inside the cell by adding a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) at specific positions. This process, called phosphorylation, leads to the activation of a series of proteins in multiple signaling pathways.The signaling pathways stimulated by the PDGFRβ protein control many important processes in the cell such as growth and division (proliferation), movement, and survival. PDGFRβ protein signaling is important for the development of many types of cells throughout the body.","PDGFRB-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia Genetic rearrangements (translocations) involving the PDGFRB gene cause a type of cancer of blood-forming cells called PDGFRB-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia. This condition is characterized by an increased number of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell. The most common of these translocations brings together part of the PDGFRB gene with another gene called ETV6, whose function is to turn off gene activity. Together, these pieces create the ETV6-PDGFRB fusion gene. Occasionally, genes other than ETV6 are fused with the PDGFRB gene. The translocations that lead to these fusion genes are somatic mutations, which are acquired during a person's lifetime and occur initially in a single cell. This cell continues to grow and divide, producing a group of cells with the same mutation (a clonal population).The protein produced from the ETV6-PDGFRB fusion gene (as well as other PDGFRB fusion genes) functions differently than the proteins normally produced from the individual genes. The ETV6/PDGFRβ fusion protein does not require ligand binding to be activated and cannot bind to DNA to turn off gene activity. As a result, signaling pathways are constantly turned on (constitutively activated) and gene activity is increased, which increases the proliferation and survival of cells.When the ETV6-PDGFRB fusion gene mutation occurs in cells that develop into blood cells, the growth of eosinophils (and occasionally other white blood cells, such as neutrophils and mast cells) is poorly controlled, leading to PDGFRB-associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia. It is unclear why eosinophils are preferentially affected by this genetic change. "
983,PDHA1 ,pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha 1 subunit,"The PDHA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called E1 alpha. The E1 alpha protein is a piece (a subunit) of a larger protein: two E1 alpha proteins combine with two copies of another protein called E1 beta (produced from the PDHB gene) to form the E1 enzyme. This enzyme, also known as pyruvate dehydrogenase, is a component of a group of proteins called the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex plays an important role in the pathways that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. This complex converts a molecule called pyruvate, which is formed from the breakdown of carbohydrates, into another molecule called acetyl-CoA. The E1 enzyme performs one part of this chemical reaction. The conversion of pyruvate is essential to begin the series of chemical reactions that produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source.","Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency Mutations in the PDHA1 gene are the most common cause of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, accounting for approximately 80 percent of cases of this condition. Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is characterized by a potentially life-threatening buildup of a chemical called lactic acid in the body (lactic acidosis), delayed development, and neurological problems. Dozens of PDHA1 gene mutations have been identified in affected individuals. These mutations have been divided into two groups. One group includes mutations that add or remove DNA building blocks (nucleotides) to the PDHA1 gene (called insertion and deletion mutations, respectively). These types of mutations occur more commonly in affected females than males. The other group includes mutations that change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the E1 alpha protein or result in a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the protein (called missense and nonsense mutations, respectively). These types of mutations occur in affected males more often than females.Mutations in the PDHA1 gene associated with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency lead to a reduction in the amount of E1 alpha protein or result in an abnormal protein that cannot function properly. The abnormal protein may not be able to interact with E1 beta to form the E1 enzyme or with other factors needed for the E1 enzyme to perform its chemical reaction. A decrease in functional E1 alpha results in reduced pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity. With decreased function of this complex, pyruvate builds up and is converted, in another chemical reaction, to lactic acid, causing lactic acidosis. In addition, the production of cellular energy is diminished. The brain, which is especially dependent on this form of energy, is severely affected, resulting in the neurological problems associated with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. "
984,PDHB ,pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 beta subunit,"The PDHB gene provides instructions for making a protein called E1 beta. E1 beta is a piece (a subunit) of a larger protein: two E1 beta proteins combine with two copies of another protein, called E1 alpha (produced from the PDHA1 gene), to form the E1 enzyme.

In addition, the production of cellular energy is diminished. The brain, which is especially dependent on this form of energy, is severely affected, resulting in the neurological problems associated with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. "
985,PDHX ,pyruvate dehydrogenase complex component X,"The PDHX gene provides instructions for making a protein called E3 binding protein, which is part of a large group of proteins known as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This complex is made up of several enzymes, including one called E3, and other proteins. E3 binding protein attaches E3 to the complex and provides the correct structure for the complex to perform its function.The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex plays an important role in the pathways that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. This enzyme converts a molecule called pyruvate, which is formed from the breakdown of carbohydrates, into another molecule called acetyl-CoA. This conversion is essential to begin the series of chemical reactions that produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source.","Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency Mutations in the PDHX gene cause pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency in a small number of people. This condition is characterized by a potentially life-threatening buildup of a chemical called lactic acid in the body (lactic acidosis), delayed development, and neurological problems. PDHX gene mutations associated with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency result in the complete absence of E3 binding protein. Loss of this protein impairs the binding of the E3 enzyme to the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which leads to a reduction of the complex's activity. With decreased function of this complex, pyruvate builds up and is converted, in another chemical reaction, to lactic acid, causing lactic acidosis. In addition, the production of cellular energy is diminished. The brain, which is especially dependent on this form of energy, is severely affected, resulting in the neurological problems associated with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. "
986,PDP1 ,pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase catalytic subunit 1,"The PDP1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1, which is part of a large group of proteins called the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. The pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 protein turns on (activates) the complex by removing a phosphate group (a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms) from the complex.The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex plays an important role in the pathways that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. This enzyme converts a molecule called pyruvate, which is formed from the breakdown of carbohydrates, into another molecule called acetyl-CoA.

Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is characterized by a potentially life-threatening buildup of a chemical called lactic acid in the body (lactic acidosis), delayed development, and neurological problems.The identified mutation removes one protein building block (amino acid) of the pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 protein, which is thought to change its shape. The abnormal protein cannot remove the phosphate group from the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which reduces the activity of the complex. With decreased activity of this complex, pyruvate builds up and is converted, in another chemical reaction, to lactic acid, causing lactic acidosis. In addition, the production of cellular energy is diminished. The brain, which is especially dependent on this form of energy, is severely affected, resulting in the neurological problems associated with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. "
987,PEPD ,peptidase D,"The PEPD gene provides instructions for making the enzyme prolidase, also called peptidase D. Prolidase helps divide certain dipeptides, which are molecules composed of two protein building blocks (amino acids). Specifically, prolidase divides dipeptides containing the amino acids proline or hydroxyproline. By freeing these amino acids, prolidase helps make them available for use in producing proteins that the body needs.Prolidase is also involved in the final step of the breakdown of some proteins obtained though the diet and proteins that are no longer needed in the body. Prolidase is particularly important in the breakdown of collagens, a family of proteins that are rich in proline and hydroxyproline. Collagens are an important part of the extracellular matrix, which is the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell. The extracellular matrix strengthens and supports connective tissues, such as skin, bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments. Collagen breakdown occurs during the maintenance (remodeling) of the extracellular matrix.","Prolidase deficiency At least 19 mutations in the PEPD gene have been identified in people with prolidase deficiency, a disorder with a wide variety of signs and symptoms including skin problems and intellectual disability. The PEPD gene mutations identified in people with prolidase deficiency result in the loss of prolidase enzyme activity.It is not well understood how the absence of prolidase activity results in the various signs and symptoms of prolidase deficiency. Researchers have suggested that accumulation of dipeptides that have not been broken down may lead to cell death. When cells die, their contents are released into the surrounding tissue, which could cause inflammation and lead to the skin problems seen in prolidase deficiency. Impaired collagen breakdown during remodeling of the extracellular matrix may also contribute to the skin problems. The intellectual disability that occurs in prolidase deficiency might result from problems in processing neuropeptides, which are brain signaling proteins that are rich in proline. It is unclear how absence of prolidase activity results in the other features of prolidase deficiency. "
988,PEX1 ,peroxisomal biogenesis factor 1,"The PEX1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called peroxisomal biogenesis factor 1 (Pex1p), which is part of a group of proteins called peroxins. Peroxins are essential for the formation and normal functioning of cell structures called peroxisomes. Peroxisomes are sac-like compartments that contain enzymes needed to break down many different substances, including fatty acids and certain toxic compounds. They are also important for the production of fats (lipids) used in digestion and in the nervous system. Peroxins assist in the formation (biogenesis) of peroxisomes by producing the membrane that separates the peroxisome from the rest of the cell and by importing enzymes into the peroxisome. Pex1p enables other peroxins to bring enzymes into the peroxisome.","Zellweger spectrum disorder At least 114 mutations in the PEX1 gene have been identified in people with Zellweger spectrum disorder, which is a group of conditions that have overlapping signs and symptoms and affect many parts of the body. The conditions' features, which vary in severity, can include weak muscle tone (hypotonia), developmental delay, and vision and hearing problems. Mutations in the PEX1 gene are the most common cause of Zellweger spectrum disorder and are found in nearly 70 percent of affected individuals.There are two common PEX1 gene mutations found in people with Zellweger spectrum disorder. One mutation replaces the protein building block (amino acid) glycine with the amino acid aspartic acid at position 843 in Pex1p (written as Gly843Asp or G843D). This mutation leads to reduced levels of the protein. Individuals who have the G843D mutation tend to have signs and symptoms that are at the less-severe end of the condition spectrum. The other common mutation, which is known as the 1700fs mutation, leads to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional Pex1p. People who have the 1700fs mutation often have signs and symptoms that are at the severe end of the condition spectrum.Mutations in the PEX1 gene that cause Zellweger spectrum disorder reduce or eliminate the activity of the Pex1p protein. Without enough functional Pex1p, enzymes are not properly imported into peroxisomes. As a result, cells contain empty peroxisomes that cannot carry out their usual functions. The severe end of the condition spectrum is caused by the absence of functional peroxisomes within cells. The less severe end of the condition spectrum results from mutations that allow some peroxisomes to form. "
989,PEX7 ,peroxisomal biogenesis factor 7,"The PEX7 gene provides instructions for making a protein called peroxisomal biogenesis factor 7, which is part of a group known as the peroxisomal assembly (PEX) proteins. Within cells, PEX proteins are responsible for importing certain enzymes into structures called peroxisomes. The enzymes in these sac-like compartments break down many different substances, including fatty acids and certain toxic compounds. They are also important for the production (synthesis) of fats (lipids) used in digestion and in the nervous system.Peroxisomal biogenesis factor 7 transports several enzymes that are essential for the normal assembly and function of peroxisomes. The most important of these enzymes is alkylglycerone phosphate synthase (produced from the AGPS gene). This enzyme is required for the synthesis of specialized lipid molecules called plasmalogens, which are present in cell membranes throughout the body. Peroxisomal biogenesis factor 7 also transports the enzyme phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase (produced from the PHYH gene). This enzyme helps process a type of fatty acid called phytanic acid, which is obtained from the diet. Phytanic acid is broken down through a multistep process into smaller molecules that the body can use for energy.","Refsum disease Mutations in the PEX7 gene cause a small percentage of all cases of Refsum disease. The three mutations known to be responsible for this condition reduce the activity of peroxisomal biogenesis factor 7, which disrupts the import of several critical enzymes (including phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase) into peroxisomes. Without enough of these enzymes, peroxisomes cannot break down fatty acids and other substances effectively.In people with Refsum disease, a shortage of phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase prevents peroxisomes from breaking down phytanic acid. Instead, this substance gradually builds up in the body's tissues. Over time, the accumulation of phytanic acid becomes toxic to cells. It is unclear, however, how an excess of this substance affects vision and smell and causes the other specific features of Refsum disease. "
990,PFKM ,"phosphofructokinase, muscle","The PFKM gene provides instructions for making one piece (the PFKM subunit) of an enzyme called phosphofructokinase. This enzyme plays a role in the breakdown of a complex sugar called glycogen, which is a major source of stored energy in the body. The phosphofructokinase enzyme is made up of four subunits and is found in a variety of tissues. Different combinations of subunits are found in different tissues. In muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles), the phosphofructokinase enzyme is composed solely of subunits produced from the PFKM gene.The cells' main source of energy is stored as glycogen. Glycogen can be broken down rapidly into the simple sugar glucose when energy is needed, for instance to maintain normal blood sugar levels between meals or for energy during exercise. Phosphofructokinase composed of PFKM subunits is involved in the sequence of events that breaks down glycogen to provide energy to muscle cells. Specifically, the enzyme converts a molecule called fructose-6-phosphate to a molecule called fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.","Glycogen storage disease type VII At least 20 mutations in the PFKM gene have been found to cause glycogen storage disease type VII (GSDVII). This condition is characterized by an inability to break down glycogen in muscle cells, resulting in muscle cramps and weakness that can vary in severity among affected individuals. PFKM gene mutations that cause GSDVII result in the production of PFKM subunits that have little or no function. One PFKM gene mutation accounts for most cases of GSDVII in people with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. This mutation (written as IVS5+1G>A) results in a small deletion of genetic material within the gene, which alters the way the gene's instructions are pieced together and causes a nonfunctional subunit to be produced.Without functional PFKM subunits, no functional phosphofructokinase is formed in skeletal muscles and glycogen cannot be completely broken down. Partially broken down glycogen builds up in muscle cells. Muscles that do not have access to glycogen as an energy source become weakened and cramped following moderate strain, such as exercise, and in some cases, begin to break down. In other tissues, other subunits that make up the phosphofructokinase enzyme likely compensate for the lack of PFKM subunits, and the enzyme is able to retain some function. This compensation may help explain why other tissues are not affected by PFKM gene mutations. It is unclear why some individuals with GSDVII are more severely affected than others. "
991,PGAM2 ,phosphoglycerate mutase 2,"The PGAM2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called phosphoglycerate mutase. The version of phosphoglycerate mutase produced from this gene is found predominantly in skeletal muscle cells. (Skeletal muscles are the muscles used for movement.) Another version of this enzyme, which is produced from a different gene, is found in many other cells and tissues.Phosphoglycerate mutase is involved in a critical energy-producing process known as glycolysis. During glycolysis, the simple sugar glucose is broken down to produce energy. Phosphoglycerate mutase helps carry out a chemical reaction that converts a molecule called 3-phosphoglycerate, which is produced during the breakdown of glucose, to another molecule called 2-phosphoglycerate.","Phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency At least five mutations in the PGAM2 gene have been found to cause phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency. The most common of these mutations, written as Trp78Ter or W78X, replaces the protein building block (amino acid) tryptophan with a premature stop signal in the instructions for making phosphoglycerate mutase. This mutation results in the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the enzyme. Other mutations change single amino acids in phosphoglycerate mutase.Mutations in the PGAM2 gene greatly reduce the activity of phosphoglycerate mutase, which disrupts energy production in skeletal muscle cells. This defect underlies the muscle cramping, muscle breakdown, and related signs and symptoms that occur following strenuous exercise in affected individuals. "
992,PGAP2 ,post-GPI attachment to proteins 2,"The PGAP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that modifies a molecule called a glycosylphosphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. The GPI anchor attaches (binds) to various proteins and then binds them to the outer surface of the cell membrane, ensuring that they are available when needed. The GPI anchor is made up of many different pieces and is assembled in a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein processing and transport. The anchor is then transferred to a different cell structure called the Golgi apparatus, which modifies newly produced enzymes and other proteins. In the Golgi apparatus, the PGAP2 protein assists in attaching a molecule called a saturated fatty acid to the anchor. This saturated fatty acid is likely needed to help transport and attach the anchor to the fat-rich cell membrane.","Mabry syndrome At least five PGAP2 gene mutations have been found to cause Mabry syndrome. The features of Mabry syndrome include intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, increased levels of an enzyme called alkaline phosphatase in the blood (hyperphosphatasia), and other signs and symptoms. These mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the PGAP2 protein and probably reduce the activity of the protein. As a result, the PGAP2 protein cannot efficiently modify the GPI anchor, likely impairing the anchor's ability to attach itself and its associated protein to the cell membrane. GPI anchor-associated proteins that cannot attach to the cell membrane are released from the cell.An enzyme called alkaline phosphatase is normally attached to the cell membrane by a GPI anchor. However, when the anchor is impaired, alkaline phosphatase is released from the cell. This abnormal release of alkaline phosphatase is responsible for the hyperphosphatasia in Mabry syndrome. It is unclear how PGAP2 gene mutations lead to the other features of Mabry syndrome, but these signs and symptoms are likely due to a lack of proper GPI anchoring of proteins to cell membranes. "
993,PGK1 ,phosphoglycerate kinase 1,"The PGK1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called phosphoglycerate kinase. This enzyme is found in cells and tissues throughout the body, where it is involved in a critical energy-producing process known as glycolysis. During glycolysis, the simple sugar glucose is broken down to produce energy.Phosphoglycerate kinase helps carry out a chemical reaction that converts a molecule called 1,3-diphosphoglycerate, which is produced during the breakdown of glucose, to another molecule called 3-phosphoglycerate. This reaction generates one molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the main energy source in cells.Researchers suspect that phosphoglycerate kinase may have additional functions, although little is known about the other roles this enzyme may play in cells.","Phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency At least 18 mutations in the PGK1 gene have been found to cause phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency. In some affected individuals, this condition causes a shortage of red blood cells (chronic hemolytic anemia) with or without neurological symptoms. In others, the condition is characterized by muscle weakness and cramping.Most PGK1 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in phosphoglycerate kinase. A few other types of mutations, including insertions and deletions of a small amount of DNA in the PGK1 gene, have also been reported. Studies suggest that PGK1 gene mutations reduce the activity of phosphoglycerate kinase, which disrupts normal energy production and leads to cell damage or cell death. It is unclear why this abnormality preferentially affects red blood cells and brain cells in some people and muscle cells in others. Researchers speculate that different PGK1 gene mutations may have varying effects on the activity of phosphoglycerate kinase in different types of cells. "
994,PGM3 ,phosphoglucomutase 3,"The PGM3 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called phosphoglucomutase 3 (PGM3). This enzyme is involved in a process called glycosylation. During this process, complex chains of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) are added to proteins and fats (lipids). Glycosylation modifies proteins and lipids so they can perform a wider variety of functions.The PGM3 enzyme converts a molecule called N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate into a different molecule called N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate. This conversion is required to make a sugar called uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), which is needed to transfer sugars to growing oligosaccharides during glycosylation.","PGM3-congenital disorder of glycosylation At least 16 mutations in the PGM3 gene have been found to cause PGM3-congenital disorder of glycosylation (PGM3-CDG). This condition primarily affects the immune system but can also involve other areas of the body. Affected individuals often have impaired immune function (immune deficiency), distinct facial features, intellectual disability, and delayed development.PGM3 gene mutations result in the production of an enzyme with reduced activity. Without a properly functioning enzyme, there is a shortage of UDP-GlcNAc and glycosylation cannot proceed normally. The wide variety of signs and symptoms in PGM3-CDG are likely due to impaired glycosylation of proteins and lipids that are needed for the normal function of many organs and tissues. Immune system proteins are highly dependent on glycosylation to function normally, which likely explains why people with PGM3-CDG have immune deficiency. "
995,PHEX ,phosphate regulating endopeptidase homolog X-linked,"The PHEX gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is active primarily in bones and teeth. Studies suggest that it cuts (cleaves) other proteins into smaller pieces; however, the proteins cleaved by the PHEX enzyme have not been identified.The PHEX enzyme could be involved in regulating the balance of phosphate in the body. Among its many functions, phosphate plays a critical role in the formation and growth of bones in childhood and helps maintain bone strength in adults. Phosphate levels are controlled in large part by the kidneys. The kidneys normally excrete excess phosphate in urine, and they reabsorb this mineral into the bloodstream when more is needed.Studies suggest that the PHEX enzyme may be involved in the regulation of a protein called fibroblast growth factor 23 (which is produced from the FGF23 gene). This protein normally inhibits the kidneys' ability to reabsorb phosphate into the bloodstream. Although the PHEX enzyme is thought to have some effect on the activity of fibroblast growth factor 23, no direct link has been established. It remains unclear how the PHEX enzyme helps control phosphate reabsorption and what role it plays in the formation and growth of bones.","Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets More than 200 mutations in the PHEX gene have been found to cause the most common form of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets, which is known as X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets. These mutations inactivate the PHEX enzyme, leaving it unable to cleave other proteins.Researchers are uncertain how mutations in the PHEX gene lead to low levels of phosphate in the blood (hypophosphatemia) and related problems with bone growth in people with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets. Because many affected individuals have increased levels of fibroblast growth factor 23, it is likely that PHEX gene mutations somehow alter the production of that protein. An increase in fibroblast growth factor 23 reduces phosphate reabsorption by the kidneys, leading to hypophosphatemia. However, because some affected individuals have normal levels of fibroblast growth factor 23, researchers are also considering other pathways by which a mutated PHEX gene could result in X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets. "
996,PHF8 ,PHD finger protein 8,"The PHF8 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in the cell nucleus, particularly in brain cells before and just after birth. The PHF8 protein is part of a group known as zinc finger proteins, which contain one or more short regions called zinc finger domains. These regions include a specific pattern of protein building blocks (amino acids) and one or more charged atoms of zinc (zinc ions). The folded configuration of the zinc finger domain stabilizes the protein and allows it to attach (bind) to other molecules.The PHF8 protein contains a specific zinc finger domain called a PHD domain, which binds to complexes called chromatin, the network of DNA and proteins (called histones) that packages DNA into chromosomes. Binding with the PHF8 protein is part of the process that changes the structure of chromatin (chromatin remodeling) to alter how tightly regions of DNA are packaged. Chromatin remodeling is one way gene activity (expression) is regulated; when DNA is tightly packed genes tend to be turned off, compared to when DNA is loosely packed and genes are usually turned on. While the PHF8 protein is bound to chromatin, another domain of the PHF8 protein, called Jumonji C (JmjC), removes molecules called methyl groups from histones. Removing these methyl groups (demethylation) causes the chromatin to become loosely packed and increases the expression of specific genes.","X-linked intellectual disability, Siderius type At least four mutations in the PHF8 gene have been found to cause X-linked intellectual disability, Siderius type. This condition is characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability, and it occurs only in males. Affected boys often have an opening in the lip (cleft lip) with an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate). Most PHF8 gene mutations lead to an abnormally short protein that gets transported out of the cell's nucleus. Outside of the nucleus, the PHF8 protein cannot interact with chromatin to regulate gene expression. Other mutations impair the protein's ability to remove methyl groups from histones within chromatin, leading to a decrease in gene expression.While the exact disease mechanism is unknown, it is likely that impaired protein function or a lack of PHF8 protein in the nucleus of brain cells before birth prevents chromatin remodeling, altering the normal expression of genes involved in intellectual function and formation of structures along the midline of the skull. This altered gene expression leads to intellectual disability and cleft lip and palate found in males with X-linked intellectual disability, Siderius type. "
997,PHF21A ,PHD finger protein 21A,"The PHF21A gene (also known as BHC80) provides instructions for making a protein involved in a process called histone demethylation, which helps control (regulate) gene activity. Histones are structural proteins that attach (bind) to DNA and give chromosomes their shape. The removal of a molecule called a methyl group from histones (histone demethylation), helps turn off (repress) certain genes. The PHF21A protein binds to histones that have already been demethylated, which researchers speculate helps keep the histone demethylated and the genes turned off. The PHF21A protein appears to be particularly important in regulating genes involved in development of nerve cells in the brain and structures of the face.","Potocki-Shaffer syndrome A genetic change resulting in the deletion of the PHF21A gene causes a condition called Potocki-Shaffer syndrome. People with this condition have enlarged openings in two bones that make up much of the top and sides of the skull (enlarged parietal foramina) and multiple noncancerous bone tumors (osteochondromas). Other signs and symptoms seen in some people with Potocki-Shaffer syndrome include intellectual disability, developmental delay, distinctive facial features, vision problems, and defects in the heart, kidneys, and urinary tract.Potocki-Shaffer syndrome (also called proximal 11p deletion syndrome) is caused by a deletion of genetic material from the short (p) arm of chromosome 11. In people with this condition, a loss of the PHF21A gene within this region is responsible for intellectual disability and distinctive facial features. The deletion likely leads to a reduction in the amount of PHF21A protein. It is thought that the resulting disruption of histone demethylation alters the activity of genes involved in neuronal and facial development, leading to intellectual disability and distinctive facial features. The loss of other genes in the same region of chromosome 11, ALX4 and EXT2, underlie the enlarged parietal foramina and multiple osteochondromas, respectively. The loss of additional genes in the deleted region likely contributes to the other features of Potocki-Shaffer syndrome. "
998,PHGDH ,phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase,"The PHGDH gene provides instructions for making the parts (subunits) that make up the phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase enzyme. Four PHGDH subunits combine to form the enzyme. This enzyme is involved in the production (synthesis) of the protein building block (amino acid) serine. Specifically, the enzyme converts a substance called 3-phosphoglycerate to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate in the first step in serine production. Serine is necessary for the development and function of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). Serine is a part of chemical messengers called neurotransmitters that transmit signals in the nervous system. Proteins that form cell membranes and the fatty layer of insulation (myelin) that surrounds many nerves also contain serine.Serine can be obtained from the diet, but brain cells must produce their own serine because dietary serine cannot cross the protective barrier that allows only certain substances to pass between blood vessels and the brain (the blood-brain barrier).","Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency At least eight mutations in the PHGDH gene have been found to cause phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency. This condition is characterized by an unusually small head size (microcephaly), severe developmental delay, and recurrent seizures that are difficult to treat (intractable epilepsy). Most of the mutations that cause this condition change single amino acids in the phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase enzyme. The mutations result in the production of an enzyme with decreased function. As a result, less 3-phosphoglycerate is converted into 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate than normal and serine production is stalled at the first step. The lack of serine likely prevents the production of proteins and neurotransmitters in the brain and impairs the formation of normal cells and myelin. These disruptions in normal brain development lead to microcephaly, severe developmental delay, and the other signs and symptoms of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency. "
999,PHKA1 ,phosphorylase kinase regulatory subunit alpha 1,"The PHKA1 gene provides instructions for making one piece, the alpha subunit, of the phosphorylase b kinase enzyme. This enzyme is made up of 16 subunits, four each of the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta subunits. (Each subunit is produced from a different gene.) The alpha subunit helps regulate the activity of phosphorylase b kinase. This enzyme is found in various tissues, although it is most abundant in the liver and muscles. One version of the enzyme is found in liver cells and another in muscle cells. The alpha-1 subunit produced from the PHKA1 gene is part of the enzyme found in muscle cells.Phosphorylase b kinase plays an important role in providing energy for cells. The main source of cellular energy is a simple sugar called glucose. Glucose is stored in muscle and liver cells in a form called glycogen. Glycogen can be broken down rapidly when glucose is needed, for instance during exercise. Phosphorylase b kinase turns on (activates) another enzyme called glycogen phosphorylase b by converting it to the more active form, glycogen phosphorylase a. When active, this enzyme breaks down glycogen.","Glycogen storage disease type IX At least seven mutations in the PHKA1 gene are known to cause a form of glycogen storage disease type IX (GSD IX) called GSD IXd or X-linked muscle glycogenosis. This form of the disorder is rare and not well understood. It affects muscles and can cause muscle weakness, pain, and cramping, particularly during exercise, although some affected individuals have no signs or symptoms of the condition. Mutations in the PHKA1 gene reduce the activity of phosphorylase b kinase in muscle cells, although the mechanism is unknown. Reduction of this enzyme's function impairs glycogen breakdown. As a result, glycogen builds up in cells, and glucose is not available for energy. Reduced energy production in muscle cells leads to the features of GSD IXd. "
1000,PHKA2 ,phosphorylase kinase regulatory subunit alpha 2,"The PHKA2 gene provides instructions for making one piece, the alpha subunit, of the phosphorylase b kinase enzyme. This enzyme is made up of 16 subunits, four each of the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta subunits. (Each subunit is produced from a different gene.) The alpha subunit helps regulate the activity of phosphorylase b kinase. This enzyme is found in various tissues, although it is most abundant in the liver and muscles. One version of the enzyme is found in liver cells and another in muscle cells. The alpha-2 subunit produced from the PHKA2 gene is part of the enzyme found in the liver.Phosphorylase b kinase plays an important role in providing energy for cells. The main source of cellular energy is a simple sugar called glucose. Glucose is stored in muscle and liver cells in a form called glycogen. Glycogen can be broken down rapidly when glucose is needed, for instance to maintain normal levels of glucose in the blood between meals. Phosphorylase b kinase turns on (activates) another enzyme called glycogen phosphorylase b by converting it to the more active form, glycogen phosphorylase a. When active, this enzyme breaks down glycogen.","Glycogen storage disease type IX At least 90 mutations in the PHKA2 gene are known to cause a form of glycogen storage disease type IX (GSD IX) called GSD IXa or X-linked liver glycogenosis (XLG). This is the most common form of GSD IX, accounting for approximately 75 percent of cases. GSD IXa affects liver function, and its characteristic features include an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), slow growth, and periods of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). These features usually improve over time. However, some affected individuals have a buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis) in the liver, which can rarely progress to irreversible liver disease (cirrhosis).Mutations in the PHKA2 gene reduce the activity of phosphorylase b kinase in liver cells, although the mechanism is unknown. Reduction of this enzyme's function impairs glycogen breakdown. As a result, glycogen builds up in cells, and glucose is not available for energy. Glycogen accumulation in the liver leads to hepatomegaly and can damage the organ. The inability to break down glycogen for energy contributes to hypoglycemia and the other features of GSD IXa.There are two subtypes of GSD IXa, known as XLG1 and XLG2, which are classified by the activity of phosphorylase b kinase in various tissues. In XLG1, the more common subtype, enzyme activity is decreased in the liver and in red blood cells. In contrast, in XLG2, the enzyme's activity appears low or normal in the liver and normal or high in red blood cells when measured by laboratory tests. The subtypes are indistinguishable based on symptoms. "
1001,PHKB ,phosphorylase kinase regulatory subunit beta,"The PHKB gene provides instructions for making one piece, the beta subunit, of the phosphorylase b kinase enzyme. This enzyme is made up of 16 subunits, four each of the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta subunits. (Each subunit is produced from a different gene.) The beta subunit helps regulate the activity of phosphorylase b kinase. This enzyme is found in various tissues, although it is most abundant in the liver and muscles. One version of the enzyme is found in liver cells and another in muscle cells. The beta subunit produced from the PHKB gene is part of the enzyme found both in the liver and in muscle.Phosphorylase b kinase plays an important role in providing energy for cells. The main source of cellular energy is a simple sugar called glucose. Glucose is stored in muscle and liver cells in a form called glycogen. Glycogen can be broken down rapidly when glucose is needed, for instance during exercise. Phosphorylase b kinase turns on (activates) another enzyme called glycogen phosphorylase b by converting it to the more active form, glycogen phosphorylase a. When active, this enzyme breaks down glycogen.","Glycogen storage disease type IX At least 21 mutations in the PHKB gene are known to cause a form of glycogen storage disease type IX (GSD IX) called GSD IXb. This form of the disorder affects the liver and the muscles. The liver problems caused by this disorder include an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), slow growth, and periods of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). These features usually improve over time. The condition can also cause mild muscle weakness, although some affected individuals have no muscle problems.Mutations in the PHKB gene reduce the activity of phosphorylase b kinase in liver and muscle cells, although the mechanism is unknown. Reduction of this enzyme's function impairs glycogen breakdown. As a result, glycogen builds up in cells, and glucose is not available for energy. The inability to break down glycogen in the liver and reduced energy production in muscle cells lead to the features of GSD IXb. "
1002,PHKG2 ,phosphorylase kinase catalytic subunit gamma 2,"The PHKG2 gene provides instructions for making one piece, the gamma subunit, of the phosphorylase b kinase enzyme. This enzyme is made up of 16 subunits, four each of the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta subunits. (Each subunit is produced from a different gene.) The gamma subunit performs the function of phosphorylase b kinase enzyme, and the other subunits help regulate its activity. This enzyme is found in various tissues, although it is most abundant in the liver and muscles. One version of the enzyme is found in liver cells and another in muscle cells. The gamma-2 subunit produced from the PHKG2 gene is part of the enzyme found in the liver.Phosphorylase b kinase plays an important role in providing energy for cells. The main source of cellular energy is a simple sugar called glucose. Glucose is stored in muscle and liver cells in a form called glycogen. Glycogen can be broken down rapidly when glucose is needed, for instance to maintain normal levels of glucose in the blood between meals. Phosphorylase b kinase turns on (activates) another enzyme called glycogen phosphorylase b by converting it to the more active form, glycogen phosphorylase a. When active, this enzyme breaks down glycogen.","Glycogen storage disease type IX At least 30 mutations in the PHKG2 gene are known to cause a form of glycogen storage disease type IX (GSD IX) called GSD IXc. This form of the disorder affects liver function and causes an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), slow growth, and periods of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in affected individuals. These features usually improve over time. However, PHKG2 gene mutations have been associated with more severe signs and symptoms such as irreversible liver disease (cirrhosis).Mutations in the PHKG2 gene reduce the activity of phosphorylase b kinase in liver cells, although the mechanism is unknown. Reduction of this enzyme's function impairs glycogen breakdown. As a result, glycogen builds up in cells, and glucose is not available for energy. The inability to break down glycogen in the liver causes the features of GSD IXc. "
1003,PHOX2A ,paired like homeobox 2A,"The PHOX2A gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in the nervous system. This protein acts early in development to help promote the formation of nerve cells (neurons) and regulate the process by which the neurons mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation).Most of researchers' knowledge about the PHOX2A protein comes from studies in animals. From these studies, it is clear that the protein plays a critical role in the development of the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary body functions such as breathing, blood pressure, heart rate, and digestion. The PHOX2A protein is also involved in the formation of certain nerves in the head and face (cranial nerves). Specifically, it appears to be critical for the development and function of cranial nerves III and IV, which emerge from the brain and control many of the muscles that surround the eyes (extraocular muscles). These muscles direct eye movement and determine the position of the eyes.","Congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles At least four mutations in the PHOX2A gene can cause congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles (CFEOM). These mutations are responsible for a form of the disorder called CFEOM2, which has been identified in several families of Middle Eastern descent.Most of the mutations that cause CFEOM2 result in the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the PHOX2A protein. A lack of this protein prevents the normal development of several cranial nerves and the extraocular muscles they control. Abnormal development and function of these muscles leads to the characteristic features of the disorder, including restricted eye movement and related problems with vision. Although the PHOX2A protein plays an important role in autonomic nervous system development, PHOX2A mutations do not seem to affect the function of this part of the nervous system. "
1004,PHOX2B ,paired like homeobox 2B,"The PHOX2B gene provides instructions for making a protein that is important during development before birth. The PHOX2B protein helps support the formation of nerve cells (neurons) and regulates the process by which the neurons mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation). During neuron development, the protein is active in the neural crest, which is a group of cells in the early embryo that give rise to many tissues and organs. Neural crest cells migrate to form parts of the autonomic nervous system, which controls body functions such as breathing, blood pressure, heart rate, and digestion. Neural crest cells also give rise to many tissues in the face and skull, and other tissue and cell types.The protein produced from the PHOX2B gene contains two areas where a protein building block (amino acid) called alanine is repeated multiple times. These stretches of alanines are known as polyalanine tracts or poly(A) tracts.","Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome More than 75 mutations in the PHOX2B gene have been found to cause congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). This condition is characterized by shallow breathing (hypoventilation), especially during sleep, that typically begins in infancy. Affected individuals often have other problems involving the autonomic nervous system, including difficulty regulating heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. Some people with CCHS also have abnormalities in the nerves that control the digestive tract (Hirschsprung disease), resulting in severe constipation, intestinal blockage, and enlargement of the colon.Most PHOX2B gene mutations that cause CCHS add extra alanines to the second polyalanine tract in the PHOX2B protein. This type of mutation is called a polyalanine repeat expansion. The mutations that cause CCHS typically increase the number of alanines from 20 to 25 or more. Other types of PHOX2B gene mutations have been identified in 8 to 10 percent of individuals with this disorder.PHOX2B gene mutations that cause CCHS are believed to interfere with the PHOX2B protein's role in supporting neuron formation and differentiation, especially in the autonomic nervous system. As a result, bodily functions that are controlled by this system, including regulation of breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature, are inconsistent in CCHS. "
1005,PHYH ,phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase,"The PHYH gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase. This enzyme is critical for the normal function of cell structures called peroxisomes. These sac-like compartments contain enzymes needed to break down many different substances, including fatty acids and certain toxic compounds.One substance that is broken down in peroxisomes is phytanic acid, a type of fatty acid obtained from the diet (particularly from beef and dairy products). Phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase is responsible for one of the first steps in breaking down phytanic acid as part of a process known as alpha-oxidation. In subsequent steps, additional enzymes in peroxisomes and other parts of the cell further process this compound into smaller molecules that the body can use for energy.Researchers suspect that phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase may have other functions in addition to its role in breaking down phytanic acid. For example, this enzyme appears to help determine the number of peroxisomes within cells and is involved in regulating their activity.","Refsum disease Mutations in the PHYH gene have been found to cause more than 90 percent of all cases of Refsum disease. About 30 mutations in this gene have been identified. These mutations alter the structure or production of phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase, which reduces the enzyme's activity. A shortage of this enzyme disrupts the breakdown of phytanic acid in peroxisomes. As a result, phytanic acid and related compounds build up in the body's tissues. The accumulation of phytanic acid is toxic to cells, although it is unclear how an excess of this substance affects vision and smell and causes the other specific features of Refsum disease. "
1006,PIGA ,phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class A,"The PIGA gene provides instructions for making a protein called phosphatidylinositol glycan class A. This protein takes part in a series of steps that produce a molecule called GPI anchor. Specifically, phosphatidylinositol glycan class A is involved in the first step of the sequence, which produces an intermediate molecule called N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphatidylinositol, or GlcNAc-PI. This step takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell, a structure involved in protein processing and transport. The PIGA protein forms a complex with several other proteins, and this complex helps to start the reaction that produces GlcNAc-PI.The GPI anchor, the ultimate product of the sequence, attaches many different proteins to the cell membrane, thereby ensuring that these proteins are available when needed at the surface of the cell.","Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria Some gene mutations are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. In people with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, somatic mutations of the PIGA gene occur in blood-forming cells called hematopoietic stem cells. Hematopoietic stem cells produce red blood cells (erythrocytes) that carry oxygen, white blood cells (leukocytes) that protect the body from infection, and platelets (thrombocytes) that are involved in blood clotting.Individuals with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria have one or more PIGA gene mutations in their hematopoietic stem cells, which leads to abnormal blood cells. As the abnormal hematopoietic stem cells multiply, populations of abnormal blood cells are formed, alongside normal blood cells produced by normal hematopoietic stem cells. The proportion of abnormal blood cells in the body affects the severity of the signs and symptoms of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.Researchers have identified more than 100 somatic mutations in the PIGA gene. Some of these mutations alter the numbers or types of protein building blocks (amino acids) in phosphatidylinositol glycan class A, which impair its function. Other mutations result in the insertion of a premature stop signal in the instructions for making phosphatidylinositol glycan class A. As a result, an abnormally small protein, which is usually unstable, is produced. "
1007,PIGO ,phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class O,"The PIGO gene provides instructions for making one part of an enzyme called GPI ethanolamine phosphate transfer 3 (GPI-ET3). The other part of the GPI-ET3 enzyme is produced from a gene called PIGF. The GPI-ET3 enzyme is involved in a series of steps that produce a molecule called a glycosylphosphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Specifically, this enzyme adds a molecule of ethanolamine phosphate to the end of the forming GPI anchor. This step takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is a structure involved in protein processing and transport within cells. The complete GPI anchor attaches (binds) to various proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum; this process requires the ethanolamine phosphate at the end of the anchor. After the anchor and protein are bound, the anchor attaches itself to the outer surface of the cell membrane, ensuring that the protein will be available when it is needed.","Mabry syndrome At least three mutations in the PIGO gene have been found to cause Mabry syndrome, a condition characterized by intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, increased levels of an enzyme called alkaline phosphatase in the blood (hyperphosphatasia), and other signs and symptoms. These mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the GPI-ET3 enzyme. The altered protein is less able to add ethanolamine phosphate to the end of GPI anchors. The incomplete GPI anchor cannot attach to proteins; without the anchor, the proteins cannot bind to the cell membrane and are released from the cell.An enzyme called alkaline phosphatase is normally attached to the cell membrane by a GPI anchor. However, when the anchor is impaired, alkaline phosphatase is released from the cell. This abnormal release of alkaline phosphatase is responsible for the hyperphosphatasia in Mabry syndrome. It is unclear how PIGO gene mutations lead to the other features of Mabry syndrome, but these signs and symptoms are likely due to a lack of proper GPI anchoring of proteins to cell membranes. "
1008,PIGV ,phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class V,"The PIGV gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called GPI mannosyltransferase 2. This enzyme takes part in a series of steps that produce a molecule called a glycosylphosphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Specifically, GPI mannosyltransferase 2 adds the second of three molecules of a complex sugar called mannose to the GPI anchor. This step takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is a structure involved in protein processing and transport within cells. The complete GPI anchor attaches (binds) to various proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. After the anchor and protein are bound, the anchor attaches itself to the outer surface of the cell membrane, ensuring that the protein will be available when it is needed.","Mabry syndrome At least 14 mutations in the PIGV gene have been found to cause Mabry syndrome, a condition characterized by intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, increased levels of an enzyme called alkaline phosphatase in the blood (hyperphosphatasia), and other signs and symptoms. These mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the GPI mannosyltransferase 2 enzyme. The altered protein is less able to add mannose to the forming GPI anchor. The incomplete GPI anchor cannot attach to proteins; without the anchor, the proteins cannot bind to the cell membrane and are released from the cell.An enzyme called alkaline phosphatase is normally attached to a GPI anchor. However, when the anchor is impaired, alkaline phosphatase cannot be anchored to the cell membrane. Instead, alkaline phosphatase is released from the cell. This abnormal release of alkaline phosphatase is responsible for the hyperphosphatasia in Mabry syndrome. It is unclear how PIGV gene mutations lead to the other features of Mabry syndrome, but these signs and symptoms are likely due to a lack of proper GPI anchoring of proteins to cell membranes. "
1009,PIK3CA ,"phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha","The PIK3CA gene provides instructions for making the p110 alpha (p110α) protein, which is one piece (subunit) of an enzyme called phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The p110α protein is called the catalytic subunit because it performs the action of PI3K, while the other subunit (produced by a different gene) regulates the enzyme's activity.Like other kinases, PI3K adds a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) to other proteins through a process called phosphorylation. PI3K phosphorylates certain signaling molecules, which triggers a series of additional reactions that transmit chemical signals within cells. PI3K signaling is important for many cell activities, including cell growth and division (proliferation), movement (migration) of cells, production of new proteins, transport of materials within cells, and cell survival. Studies suggest that PI3K signaling may be involved in the regulation of several hormones and may play a role in the maturation of fat cells (adipocytes).","Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome At least five mutations in the PIK3CA gene have been found to cause Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. This condition is characterized by a red birthmark called a port-wine stain, abnormal overgrowth of soft tissues (such as skin and muscles) and bones, and vein malformations. The PIK3CA gene mutations associated with this condition arise randomly in one cell during the early stages of development before birth. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. As cells continue to divide during development, cells arising from the first abnormal cell will have the mutation, and other cells will not. This mixture of cells with and without a genetic mutation is known as mosaicism.The PIK3CA gene mutations associated with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the p110α protein. These changes lead to production of an altered p110α subunit that makes PI3K abnormally active. The altered enzyme triggers unregulated chemical signaling in cells, which allows cells to grow and divide continuously. Increased cell proliferation leads to abnormal growth of the bones, soft tissues, and blood vessels.Despite the involvement of PIK3CA gene mutations in cancer (described below) and the overgrowth of cells caused by changes in this gene, individuals with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome do not appear to have an elevated risk of developing cancer. "
1010,PIK3CD ,"phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit delta","The PIK3CD gene provides instructions for making the p110 delta (p110δ) protein, which is one piece (subunit) of an enzyme called phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The version of PI3K containing the p110δ subunit, called PI3K-delta, is specifically found in white blood cells, including immune system cells (lymphocytes) called B cells and T cells. These cells recognize and attack foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, to prevent infection.Like other kinases, PI3K-delta adds a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) to other proteins through a process called phosphorylation. PI3K-delta phosphorylates certain signaling molecules, which triggers a series of additional reactions that transmit chemical signals within cells. In lymphocytes, PI3K-delta signaling is important for many cell activities, including cell growth and division (proliferation) and maturation (differentiation). PI3K-delta helps direct B cells and T cells to differentiate into different types, each of which has a distinct function in the immune system.","Activated PI3K-delta syndrome At least four mutations in the PIK3CD gene have been found to cause a form of immunodeficiency called activated PI3K-delta syndrome. Immunodeficiencies are conditions in which the immune system is not able to protect the body effectively from foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. People with activated PI3K-delta syndrome typically have recurrent bacterial infections of the respiratory tract and chronic viral infections.The PIK3CD gene mutations involved in activated PI3K-delta syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the p110δ protein; the most common mutation replaces the amino acid glutamic acid with the amino acid lysine at position 1021 of the protein (written as Glu1021Lys or E1021K). A PI3K-delta enzyme containing the altered p110δ subunit is abnormally turned on (activated). Studies indicate that this overactive signaling causes T cells to mature and die too quickly. The excess signaling also blocks maturation of B cells at an early stage; the immature B cells cannot respond to foreign invaders and likely self-destruct. Lack of T cells and B cells makes it difficult for people with this disorder to fight off bacterial and viral infections. Overactivation of PI3K-delta signaling can also stimulate abnormal proliferation of lymphocytes, and accumulation of these cells can lead to enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy). Activated PI3K-delta syndrome also increases the risk of developing a form of cancer called B-cell lymphoma. "
1011,PIK3R1 ,phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1,"The PIK3R1 gene provides instructions for making a part (subunit) of an enzyme called phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The primary function of the subunit is to regulate the enzyme's activity. Several slightly different versions of this regulatory subunit are produced from the PIK3R1 gene; the most abundant of these is called p85α.PI3K is a kinase, which means that it adds a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) to other proteins through a process called phosphorylation. PI3K phosphorylates certain signaling molecules, which triggers a series of additional reactions that transmit chemical signals within cells. PI3K signaling is important for many cell activities, including cell growth and division, movement (migration) of cells, production of new proteins, transport of materials within cells, and cell survival. Studies suggest that PI3K signaling may be involved in the regulation of several hormones, including insulin, which helps control blood sugar levels. PI3K signaling may also play a role in the maturation of fat cells (adipocytes).","Short stature, hyperextensibility, hernia, ocular depression, Rieger anomaly, and teething delay At least seven mutations in the PIK3R1 gene have been reported to cause a condition known as short stature, hyperextensibility, hernia, ocular depression, Rieger anomaly, and teething delay (often called SHORT syndrome). This condition is characterized by signs and symptoms affecting many parts of the body, including the skin, eyes, teeth, and joints. The most common mutation, which has been identified in at least 10 affected families, changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the regulatory subunit of PI3K. Specifically, the amino acid arginine is replaced with the amino acid tryptophan at protein position 649 (written as Arg649Trp or R649W). Mutations in the PIK3R1 gene alter the structure of the subunit, which reduces the ability of PI3K to participate in cell signaling. Because the mutations reduce the enzyme's activity, they are described as ""loss-of-function"" mutations.Researchers are working to determine how PIK3R1 gene mutations lead to the specific features of SHORT syndrome. PI3K's role in insulin activity may be related to insulin resistance and diabetes, which are problems with blood sugar regulation that are found in some people with SHORT syndrome. Abnormal adipocyte maturation might contribute to a lack of fatty tissue under the skin (lipoatrophy), which is another common feature of the condition. It is unclear how reduced PI3K signaling is associated with the other signs and symptoms of SHORT syndrome. "
1012,PIK3R2 ,phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 2,"The PIK3R2 gene provides instructions for making one piece (subunit) of an enzyme called phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The primary function of the subunit, which is known as P85β, is to regulate the PI3K enzyme's activity.PI3K is a kinase, which means that it adds a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) to other proteins through a process called phosphorylation. PI3K phosphorylates certain signaling molecules, which triggers a series of additional reactions as part of a chemical signaling pathway called the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. This signaling influences many critical cell functions, including the creation (synthesis) of new proteins, cell growth and division (proliferation), and the survival of cells. The PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is essential for the normal development of many parts of the body, including the brain.","Megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome At least four mutations in the PIK3R2 gene have been found to cause megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndrome. This rare condition affects the development of the brain, causing an unusually large brain and head size (megalencephaly) and other abnormalities of the brain's structure. Some affected individuals also have an extra finger or toe on one or more of their hands or feet (polydactyly).Each of the known mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the P85β subunit of PI3K. The most common mutation replaces the amino acid glycine with the amino acid arginine at position 373 (written as Gly373Arg or G373R). All of the mutations are described as ""gain-of-function"" because they increase the activity of PI3K. This enhanced activity increases chemical signaling through the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, which leads to excessive cell growth and division. In the brain, the increased number of cells leads to rapid and abnormal brain growth starting before birth. It is less clear how these changes contribute to polydactyly, although the extra digits are probably related to abnormal cell proliferation in the developing hands and feet. "
1013,PINK1 ,PTEN induced kinase 1,"The PINK1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called PTEN induced putative kinase 1. This protein is found in cells throughout the body, with highest levels in the heart, muscles, and testes. Within cells, the protein is located in the mitochondria, the energy-producing centers that provide power for cellular activities. The function of PTEN induced putative kinase 1 is not fully understood. It appears to help protect mitochondria from malfunctioning during periods of cellular stress, such as unusually high energy demands.Researchers believe that two specialized regions of PTEN induced putative kinase 1 are essential for the protein to function properly. One region, called the mitochondrial-targeting motif, serves as a delivery address: after the protein is made, this motif helps ensure that it is delivered to the mitochondria. Another region, called the kinase domain, probably carries out the protein's protective function.","Parkinson disease Researchers have identified more than 70 mutations in the PINK1 gene that can cause Parkinson disease, a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement and balance. PINK1 gene mutations are associated with the early-onset form of the disorder, which typically begins before age 50.Many PINK1 gene mutations alter or eliminate the kinase domain, leading to a loss of protein function. At least one mutation affects the mitochondrial-targeting motif and may disrupt delivery of the protein to mitochondria. With reduced or absent PTEN induced putative kinase 1 activity, mitochondria may malfunction, particularly when cells are stressed. Cells can die if energy is not provided for essential activities. It is unclear how PINK1 gene mutations cause the selective death of nerve cells that characterizes Parkinson disease. The loss of these cells weakens communication between the brain and muscles, and ultimately the brain becomes unable to control muscle movement. "
1014,PITX1 ,paired like homeodomain 1,"The PITX1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in development of the lower limbs. The PITX1 protein is found primarily in the developing legs and feet. The protein acts as a transcription factor, which is a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. Specifically, PITX1 regulates the activity of genes to direct the shape and structure of tissues in the lower limbs, including the bones, muscles, and tendons (the bands of tissue that connect muscles to bones).The PITX1 protein is also found in the developing pituitary gland, which is a hormone-producing gland located at the base of the brain, and in an embryonic structure called the branchial arch. The PITX1 protein may play a role in formation of the pituitary gland and tissues derived from the branchial arch, such as the roof of the mouth, the jaw, and parts of the inner ear.","Liebenberg syndrome Changes in the DNA near the PITX1 gene cause Liebenberg syndrome, a rare condition characterized by abnormal development of the arms, resulting in short fingers (brachydactyly), joint deformities called contractures that limit movement of the elbows and wrists, and other bone and muscle abnormalities. These genetic changes delete, insert, or rearrange genetic material near the PITX1 gene; at least five such mutations have been identified in affected individuals. These changes affect regions of DNA known as regulatory elements, which help turn on or turn off genes (known as enhancers or repressors, respectively). They control when and where certain genes are active. The mutations that cause Liebenberg syndrome likely relocate enhancers that promote the activity of genes involved in upper limb development to be near the PITX1 gene. Alternatively, mutations may remove repressors that normally turn off the PITX1 gene during upper limb development. As a result, the PITX1 gene is abnormally active during arm and hand development. Because the PITX1 protein normally directs lower limb structure, bones, muscles, and tendons in the arms and hands develop more like those in the legs and feet, leading to the features of Liebenberg syndrome. Development of the lower limbs is normal in people with this condition. "
1015,PITX2 ,paired like homeodomain 2,"The PITX2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and regulates the activity of other genes. On the basis of this action, the PITX2 protein is called a transcription factor. The PITX2 gene is part of a family of homeobox genes, which act during early embryonic development to control the formation of many parts of the body.The PITX2 protein plays a critical role in early development, particularly in the formation of structures in the front part of the eye (the anterior segment). These structures include the colored part of the eye (the iris), the lens of the eye, and the clear front covering of the eye (the cornea). Studies suggest that the PITX2 protein also has functions in the adult eye, such as helping cells respond to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress occurs when unstable molecules called free radicals accumulate to levels that can damage or kill cells.The PITX2 protein is also involved in the normal development of other parts of the body, including the teeth, heart, and abdominal organs.","Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome More than 45 mutations in the PITX2 gene have been found to cause Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome type 1, a condition that affects the development of the anterior segment of the eye and other parts of the body. Most PITX2 gene mutations reduce the amount of functional PITX2 protein that is produced in cells. However, some genetic changes (such as a duplication of the PITX2 gene) increase the amount or function of the PITX2 protein. Having either too little or too much of this protein disrupts the regulation of other genes needed for normal development.Eye development appears to be the most sensitive to changes in PITX2 protein activity, and abnormalities of the anterior segment of the eye are the predominant features of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome. However, changes in the amount of PITX2 protein can also lead to distinctive facial features, tooth abnormalities, and problems with development of other parts of the body in people with this condition. "
1016,PKD1 ,"polycystin 1, transient receptor potential channel interacting","The PKD1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called polycystin-1. This protein is most active in kidney cells before birth; much less of the protein is made in normal adult kidneys. Although its exact function is not well understood, polycystin-1 appears to interact with a smaller, somewhat similar protein called polycystin-2.Polycystin-1 spans the cell membrane of kidney cells, so that one end of the protein remains inside the cell and the other end projects from the outer surface of the cell. This positioning of the protein allows it to interact with other proteins, carbohydrates, and fat molecules (lipids) outside the cell and to receive signals that help the cell respond to its environment. When a molecule binds to polycystin-1 on the surface of the cell, the protein interacts with polycystin-2 to trigger a cascade of chemical reactions inside the cell. These chemical reactions instruct the cell to undergo certain changes, such as maturing to take on specialized functions. Polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 likely work together to help regulate cell growth and division (proliferation), cell movement (migration), and interactions with other cells.Polycystin-1 is also found in cell structures called primary cilia. Primary cilia are tiny, fingerlike projections that line the small tubes where urine is formed (renal tubules). Researchers believe that primary cilia sense the movement of fluid through these tubules, which appears to help maintain the tubules' size and structure. The interaction of polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 in renal tubules promotes the normal development and function of the kidneys.","Polycystic kidney disease More than 250 mutations in the PKD1 gene have been identified in people with polycystic kidney disease. These mutations are responsible for about 85 percent of cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which is the most common type of this disorder. Mutations in the PKD1 gene include deletions or insertions of DNA building blocks (base pairs) and alterations of one or more base pairs. Most PKD1 mutations are predicted to produce an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the polycystin-1 protein. Although researchers are uncertain how a lack of polycystin-1 leads to the formation of cysts, it probably disrupts the protein's signaling function within the cell and in primary cilia. As a result, cells lining the renal tubules may grow and divide abnormally, leading to the growth of numerous cysts characteristic of polycystic kidney disease. "
1017,PKD2 ,"polycystin 2, transient receptor potential cation channel","The PKD2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called polycystin-2. This protein is found in the kidneys before birth and in many adult tissues. Although its exact function is not well understood, polycystin-2 can be regulated by a larger, somewhat similar protein called polycystin-1.Polycystin-2 likely functions as a channel spanning the cell membrane of kidney cells. In conjunction with polycystin-1, the channel transports positively charged atoms (ions), particularly calcium ions, into the cell. This influx of calcium ions triggers a cascade of chemical reactions inside the cell that may instruct the cell to undergo certain changes, such as maturing to take on specialized functions. Polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 likely work together to help regulate cell growth and division (proliferation), cell movement (migration), and interactions with other cells.Polycystin-2 is also active in other parts of the cell, including cellular structures called primary cilia. Primary cilia are tiny, fingerlike projections that line the small tubes where urine is formed (renal tubules). Researchers believe that primary cilia sense the movement of fluid through these tubules, which appears to help maintain the tubules' size and structure. The interaction of polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 in renal tubules promotes the normal development and function of the kidneys.","Polycystic kidney disease More than 75 mutations in the PKD2 gene have been identified in people with polycystic kidney disease. These mutations are responsible for about 15 percent of all cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which is the most common type of this disorder. Mutations in the PKD2 gene include changes in single DNA building blocks (base pairs) and deletions or insertions of a small number of base pairs in the gene. Most PKD2 mutations are predicted to result in the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the polycystin-2 protein. Although researchers are uncertain how a lack of polycystin-2 leads to the formation of cysts, it likely disrupts the protein's interaction with polycystin-1 and alters signaling within the cell and in primary cilia. As a result, cells lining the renal tubules may grow and divide abnormally, leading to the growth of numerous cysts characteristic of polycystic kidney disease. "
1018,PKHD1 ,"PKHD1, fibrocystin/polyductin","The PKHD1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called fibrocystin (sometimes known as polyductin). This protein is present in fetal and adult kidney cells, and is also present at low levels in the liver and pancreas.Fibrocystin spans the cell membrane of kidney cells, so that one end of the protein remains inside the cell and the other end projects from the outer surface of the cell. Based on its structure, fibrocystin may act as a receptor, interacting with molecules outside the cell and receiving signals that help the cell respond to its environment. This protein also may be involved in connecting cells together (adhesion), keeping cells apart (repulsion), and promoting the growth and division of cells (proliferation).Fibrocystin is also found in cell structures called primary cilia. Primary cilia are tiny, fingerlike projections that line the small tubes where urine is formed (renal tubules). Researchers believe that primary cilia play an important role in maintaining the size and structure of these tubules; however, the function of fibrocystin in primary cilia remains unclear.","Polycystic kidney disease More than 270 mutations in the PKHD1 gene have been identified in people with polycystic kidney disease. These mutations cause autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), which is a severe type of the disorder that is usually evident at birth or in early infancy. PKHD1 mutations include changes in single DNA building blocks (base pairs) and insertions or deletions of a small number of base pairs in the gene. These mutations disrupt the normal structure and function of the fibrocystin protein, or lead to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the protein. Researchers have not determined how these genetic changes lead to the formation of numerous cysts characteristic of polycystic kidney disease. "
1019,PKLR ,pyruvate kinase L/R,"The PKLR gene is active (expressed) in the liver and in red blood cells, where it provides instructions for producing an enzyme called pyruvate kinase. This enzyme is involved in a critical energy-producing process known as glycolysis. During glycolysis, the simple sugar glucose is broken down to produce energy. Specifically, pyruvate kinase is involved in the last step of the glycolytic pathway. In this step, a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) is moved from a molecule called phosphoenolpyruvate to another molecule called adenosine diphosphate (ADP), resulting in molecules called pyruvate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is the cell's main energy source.","Pyruvate kinase deficiency More than 200 mutations in the PKLR gene have been identified in people with pyruvate kinase deficiency. People with this disorder have two PKLR gene mutations in each cell. Most of the mutations that cause pyruvate kinase deficiency replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the pyruvate kinase enzyme or result in an enzyme that is abnormally short. The mutations lead to reduced pyruvate kinase enzyme function, causing a shortage of ATP in red blood cells and increased levels of other molecules produced earlier in the glycolysis process. The abnormal red blood cells are gathered up by the spleen and destroyed.The resulting shortage of oxygen-carrying red blood cells (anemia) leads to extreme tiredness (fatigue), unusually pale skin (pallor), and shortness of breath. Iron and a molecule called bilirubin are released when red blood cells are destroyed, resulting in an excess of these substances circulating in the blood. Excess bilirubin in the blood causes yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice) and increases the risk of developing small pebble-like deposits in the gallbladder or bile ducts (gallstones). "
1020,PKP2 ,plakophilin 2,"The PKP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called plakophilin 2. This protein is found primarily in cells of the myocardium, which is the muscular wall of the heart. Within these cells, plakophilin 2 is one of several proteins that make up structures called desmosomes. These structures form junctions that attach cells to one another. Desmosomes provide strength to the myocardium and are involved in signaling between neighboring cells.","Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy More than 230 mutations in the PKP2 gene have been identified in people with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). This condition most commonly affects the myocardium surrounding the right ventricle, one of the two lower chambers of the heart. ARVC increases the risk of an abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia) and sudden death.Some PKP2 gene mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short version of plakophilin 2. Other mutations alter the structure of plakophilin 2 by adding, deleting, or changing one or more of its protein building blocks (amino acids). Studies suggest that the altered protein impairs the formation and function of desmosomes.Without normal desmosomes, cells of the myocardium detach from one another and die, particularly when the heart muscle is placed under stress (such as during vigorous exercise). The damaged myocardium is gradually replaced by fat and scar tissue. As this abnormal tissue builds up, the walls of the right ventricle become stretched out, preventing the heart from pumping blood effectively. These changes also disrupt the electrical signals that control the heartbeat, which can lead to arrhythmia. "
1021,PLA2G6 ,phospholipase A2 group VI,"The PLA2G6 gene provides instructions for making a type of enzyme called an A2 phospholipase. This type of enzyme is involved in breaking down (metabolizing) fats called phospholipids. Phospholipid metabolism is important for many body processes, including helping to maintain the integrity of the cell membrane. Specifically, the A2 phospholipase produced from the PLA2G6 gene, sometimes called PLA2 group VI, helps to regulate the levels of a compound called phosphatidylcholine, which is abundant in the cell membrane.","Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy At least 50 mutations in the PLA2G6 gene have been identified in people with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy, a progressive neurological disorder that causes intellectual disability and movement problems. Mutations in the PLA2G6 gene eliminate or severely impair the function of the PLA2 group VI enzyme. Impairment of PLA2 group VI enzyme function may disrupt cell membrane maintenance and contribute to the development of swellings called spheroid bodies in the axons, which are fibers that extend from nerve cells (neurons) and transmit impulses to muscles and other neurons. Although it is unknown how changes in this enzyme's function lead to the signs and symptoms of infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy, phospholipid metabolism problems have been seen in both this disorder and a similar disorder called pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. These disorders, as well as the more common Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease, also are associated with changes in brain iron metabolism. Researchers are studying the links between phospholipid defects, brain iron, and damage to nerve cells, but have not determined how the iron accumulation that occurs in some individuals with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy may contribute to the features of this disorder. "
1022,PLAGL1 ,PLAG1 like zinc finger 1,"The PLAGL1 gene provides instructions for making a member of a protein family called zinc finger proteins. Zinc finger proteins are involved in many cellular functions. These proteins each contain one or more short regions called zinc finger domains, which include a specific pattern of protein building blocks (amino acids) and one or more charged atoms of zinc (zinc ions).Zinc finger proteins attach (bind) primarily to DNA. In most cases, they attach to regions near certain genes and turn the genes on and off as needed. Proteins that bind to DNA and regulate the activity of particular genes are known as transcription factors. Some zinc finger proteins can also bind to other molecules, including RNA (a chemical cousin of DNA) and proteins.The PLAGL1 protein helps regulate the cell's process for replicating itself in an organized, step-by-step fashion (cell cycle), and is involved in the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). It is also important in fetal growth. The PLAGL1 protein helps control another protein called the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide receptor (PACAP1). One of the functions of the PACAP1 protein is to stimulate insulin secretion by beta cells in the pancreas. Insulin controls how much glucose (a type of sugar) is passed from the blood into cells for conversion to energy.PLAGL1 is a paternally expressed imprinted gene, which means that normally only the copy of the gene that comes from the father is active. The copy of the gene that comes from the mother is inactivated (silenced) by a mechanism called methylation.","6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus, a type of diabetes that occurs in infants, is caused by the overactivity (overexpression) of the PLAGL1 gene. There are three ways that overexpression of the PLAGL1 gene can occur. About 40 percent of cases of 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus are caused by a genetic change known as paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 6. In paternal UPD, people inherit both copies of a chromosome from their father instead of one copy from each parent. Paternal UPD causes people to have two active copies of paternally expressed imprinted genes, rather than one active copy from the father and one inactive copy from the mother.Another 40 percent of cases of 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus occur when the copy of chromosome 6 that comes from the father has a duplication of genetic material including the PLAGL1 gene.The third mechanism by which overexpression of the PLAGL1 gene can occur is by impaired silencing of the maternal copy of the gene (maternal hypomethylation). Approximately 20 percent of cases of 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus are caused by maternal hypomethylation. Some people with this disorder have a genetic change in the maternal copy of the 6q24 region that prevents genes in that region from being silenced. Other affected individuals have a more generalized impairment of gene silencing involving many imprinted regions, called hypomethylation of imprinted loci (HIL). HIL results from mutations in other genes.It is not well understood how overexpression of the PLAGL1 gene causes 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus and why the condition improves after infancy. Researchers suggest that PLAGL1 overexpression may reduce the number of insulin-secreting beta cells or impair their function in affected individuals. Lack of sufficient insulin results in the impaired blood sugar control associated with diabetes mellitus. In individuals with 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus, these signs and symptoms are most likely to occur during times of physiologic stress, including the rapid growth of infancy, childhood illnesses, and pregnancy. Because insulin acts as a growth promoter during early development, a shortage of this hormone may account for the slow prenatal growth seen in 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus. "
1023,PLCB4 ,phospholipase C beta 4,"The PLCB4 gene provides instructions for making one form (the beta 4 isoform) of a protein called phospholipase C. This protein is involved in a signaling pathway within cells known as the phosphoinositide cycle, which helps transmit information from outside the cell to inside the cell. Phospholipase C carries out one particular step in the phosphoinositide cycle: the conversion of a molecule called phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to two smaller molecules, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol. These smaller molecules relay messages into the cell that ultimately influence many cell activities.Studies suggest that the beta 4 isoform of phospholipase C contributes to the development of the first and second pharyngeal arches. These embryonic structures ultimately develop into the jawbones, facial muscles, middle ear bones, ear canals, outer ears, and related tissues. This protein is also thought to play a role in vision, particularly in the function of the retina, which is a specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color.","Auriculo-condylar syndrome At least nine mutations in the PLCB4 gene have been found to cause auriculo-condylar syndrome, a disorder that primarily affects the development of the ears and lower jaw (mandible). The identified mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the the beta 4 isoform of phospholipase C. These changes likely alter the structure of the protein and impair the phosphoinositide cycle. Abnormal signaling alters the formation of the lower jaw: instead of developing normally, the lower jaw becomes shaped more like the smaller upper jaw (maxilla). The abnormal shape leads to an unusually small chin (micrognathia) and problems with jaw function. Researchers are working to determine how mutations in this gene lead to the other developmental abnormalities associated with auriculo-condylar syndrome. "
1024,PLCG2 ,phospholipase C gamma 2,"The PLCG2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCγ2). This enzyme performs a chemical reaction that enables molecules to relay signals from outside the cell to the inside. These signals direct cellular functions, including growth, maturation, and movement (migration). The PLCγ2 enzyme is particularly important in immune system cells, including B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and mast cells. The enzyme is critical for the cells' roles in preventing infection by recognizing and attacking foreign invaders, such as bacteria and viruses.When foreign invaders are detected, the PLCγ2 enzyme relays signals for B cells to produce specialized proteins called antibodies (or immunoglobulins) that attach to foreign particles and mark them for destruction. Signaling through the enzyme is also involved in the destruction of foreign invaders by NK cells. PLCγ2 enzyme signaling in mast cells and other immune cells triggers inflammation, which helps clear infections or other irritants. Mast cells also play a role in allergic reactions, which occur when the immune system overreacts to stimuli that are not harmful.","PLCG2-associated antibody deficiency and immune dysregulation At least three mutations in the PLCG2 gene have been found to cause PLCG2-associated antibody deficiency and immune dysregulation (PLAID). This condition is characterized by the development of a red, itchy rash (known as hives or urticaria) when exposed to cool temperatures, in particular cooling caused by evaporation, such as when a cool breeze blows on damp skin. Other skin rashes, recurrent infections, and autoimmune diseases, which occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues, can also occur in PLAID.The mutations associated with PLAID are classified as germline, which means they are present in essentially all of the body's cells. They remove (delete) small pieces of DNA from the PLCG2 gene. These changes alter a region of the PLCγ2 enzyme that controls whether the enzyme is turned on (activated) or turned off (inactivated).The altered PLCγ2 enzyme does not function normally. At low temperatures, the enzyme is constantly turned on, even when it is not needed. Signals triggered by PLCγ2 in response to cold, particularly in mast cells in the skin, likely result in hives and other skin rashes. Researchers are unsure if a similar mechanism underlies autoimmune disease in people with PLAID.In contrast, at normal body temperature the altered enzyme's activity is reduced. The resulting impairment of B-cell and NK-cell function prevents the body from effectively fighting foreign invaders, leading to recurrent infections in people with PLAID. "
1025,PLEC ,plectin,"The PLEC gene provides instructions for making a protein called plectin. This protein is produced in many different tissues in the body, including skin and muscle. Within cells, plectin interacts with several molecules that make up the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton). For example, plectin interacts with intermediate filaments, which form networks that provide support and strength to cells. Plectin attaches (cross-links) intermediate filaments to one another and to the cell membrane.The exact function of plectin in different tissues is unclear. In skin cells, this protein is an essential part of structures called hemidesmosomes, which attach the network of intermediate filaments to the cell membrane. It is also a component of desmosomes, which form junctions between neighboring cells. As part of these structures, plectin plays a critical role in anchoring the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) to underlying layers.","Epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric atresia At least nine mutations in the PLEC gene can cause epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric atresia (EB-PA). In addition to skin blistering, people with EB-PA are born with a life-threatening obstruction of the digestive tract called pyloric atresia. Mutations in the PLEC gene account for about 15 percent of all cases of EB-PA.The PLEC gene mutations responsible for EB-PA change the normal structure and function of plectin. Mutations that prevent the cell from making any functional plectin tend to cause more severe signs and symptoms, while mutations that reduce the amount of plectin or alter the protein's structure usually cause milder signs and symptoms. A shortage of functional plectin disrupts the attachment of the epidermis to underlying skin layers, making the skin less resistant to friction and minor trauma. It is less clear how mutations in the PLEC gene are related to pyloric atresia. "
1026,PLG ,plasminogen,"The PLG gene provides instructions for making a protein called plasminogen, which is produced in the liver. Enzymes called plasminogen activators convert plasminogen into the protein plasmin, which breaks down another protein called fibrin. Fibrin is the main protein involved in blood clots and is important for wound healing, creating the framework for normal tissue to grow back. Excess fibrin is broken down when no longer needed, and the new, more flexible normal tissue takes its place.","Congenital plasminogen deficiency More than 50 mutations in the PLG gene have been identified in people with congenital plasminogen deficiency. This disorder is characterized by hard growths on the mucous membranes, which are the moist tissues that line body openings such as the eyelids and the inside of the mouth. Congenital plasminogen deficiency most often affects the conjunctiva, which are the mucous membranes that protect the white part of the eye (the sclera) and line the eyelids.PLG gene mutations can decrease the amount of plasminogen produced, its function, or both. When the mutations affect plasminogen levels as well as the activity of the protein, affected individuals may be said to have type I congenital plasminogen deficiency, characterized by the growths previously described. People with PLG gene mutations that result in normal levels of plasminogen with reduced activity are said to have type II congenital plasminogen deficiency or dysplasminogenemia. This form of the condition often has no symptoms.A reduction in functional plasminogen results in less plasmin to break down fibrin, leading to a buildup of fibrin. The excess fibrin and the resulting inflammation of the tissue result in the inflamed growths characteristic of congenital plasminogen deficiency.It is unclear why the excess fibrin builds up in the mucous membranes but does not usually result in abnormal clots in the blood vessels (thromboses). Researchers suggest that other enzymes in the blood may also break down fibrin, helping to compensate for the reduced plasminogen levels. "
1027,PLOD1 ,"procollagen-lysine,2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 1","The PLOD1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called lysyl hydroxylase 1. This enzyme modifies an amino acid called lysine, which is one of the building blocks used to make proteins. Specifically, lysyl hydroxylase 1 converts lysine to a similar molecule, hydroxylysine, through a chemical reaction called hydroxylation. Hydroxylysine is commonly found in collagens, which are complex molecules that provide strength and support to many body tissues.Hydroxylysine is essential for collagen molecules to form stable interactions, called cross-links, with one another in the spaces between cells. The cross-links result in the formation of very strong collagen fibers.","Ehlers-Danlos syndrome More than 30 mutations in the PLOD1 gene have been found to cause a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome called the kyphoscoliotic type. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect the connective tissues that support the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues. The kyphoscoliotic type is characterized by an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility), weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and severe, progressive curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis) that can interfere with breathing.The most common PLOD1 gene mutation abnormally copies (duplicates) a large portion of the gene, resulting in the production of a nonfunctional version of the lysyl hydroxylase 1 enzyme. Several other mutations introduce premature stop signals that prevent the production of any functional enzyme. A loss of lysyl hydroxylase 1 activity greatly reduces the amount of hydroxylysine, which impairs cross-linking between collagen molecules. This disruption in the network of collagen fibers weakens connective tissues, causing the signs and symptoms of the kyphoscoliotic type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. "
1028,PLP1 ,proteolipid protein 1,"The PLP1 gene provides instructions for producing proteolipid protein 1 and a modified version (isoform) of that protein called DM20. Proteolipid protein 1 is found primarily in nerves in the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system) and DM20 is produced mainly in nerves that connect the brain and spinal cord to muscles (the peripheral nervous system). These two proteins are found within the cell membrane of nerve cells, where they make up a large proportion of myelin and help myelin stay anchored to the cells. Myelin is the fatty covering that insulates nerve fibers and promotes the rapid transmission of nerve impulses.","Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease There are more than 280 mutations in the PLP1 gene that have been found to cause Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease is an inherited condition involving the central nervous system that primarily affects males. Individuals with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease have neurological problems including abnormal eye movements (nystagmus) and other movement abnormalities. In addition, these individuals have difficulty walking or cannot walk.An extra copy (duplication) of the PLP1 gene accounts for 50 to 70 percent of all Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease mutations. In many cases, genes near the PLP1 gene are also duplicated, but having extra copies of these genes does not seem to impact the severity of the condition. In another 10 to 25 percent of cases, mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the proteolipid protein 1 and DM20 proteins and lead to excess or abnormal proteins that are often misfolded. Excess or abnormal proteins become trapped within cell structures and cannot travel to the cell membrane. The accumulation of excess proteins leads to swelling and breakdown of nerve fibers. In less than 2 percent of cases, a mutation that deletes the entire PLP1 gene causes Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. Such a deletion prevents production of proteolipid protein 1 and DM20 protein.All of these PLP1 gene mutations prevent proteolipid protein 1 and DM20 from reaching the nerve cell membrane where they are needed to form myelin. Decreased myelin production leads to nerve fiber damage and the loss of nerve fibers that are covered by myelin (leukodystrophy), leading to impairment of nervous system function and the signs and symptoms of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. "
1029,PML ,promyelocytic leukemia,"The PML gene provides instructions for a protein that acts as a tumor suppressor, which means it prevents cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. The PML protein is found in distinct structures in the nucleus of a cell called PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). In the PML-NBs, the PML protein interacts with other proteins that are involved in cell growth and division (proliferation) and self-destruction (apoptosis). The PML protein is able to block cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in combination with other proteins. Researchers believe that the structure of the PML-NBs is required for blocking proliferation and inducing apoptosis.","Acute promyelocytic leukemia Gene mutations can be acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. These mutations are called somatic mutations, and they are not inherited. A somatic mutation involving the PML gene causes acute promyelocytic leukemia, a cancer of the blood forming tissue (bone marrow). Acute promyelocytic leukemia is characterized by an accumulation of immature white blood cells, called promyelocytes, in the bone marrow. A rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 15 and 17, written as t(15;17), fuses part of the PML gene on chromosome 15 with part of another gene on chromosome 17 called RARA. The protein produced from this fused gene, PML-RARα, functions differently than the protein products of the normal PML and RARA genes.The PML-RARα protein does not localize to the PML-NBs, and the structures do not form properly. The PML-RARα protein is unable to block cell proliferation or induce apoptosis.Additionally, the function of the RARα protein, the product of the RARA gene, is disrupted. Normally, this protein is involved in the regulation of gene transcription, which is the first step in protein production. Specifically, this protein helps control the transcription of certain genes important in the maturation (differentiation) of white blood cells beyond the promyelocyte stage. However, the PML-RARα protein blocks (represses) gene transcription.The PML-RARα protein allows abnormal cell proliferation and blocks the differentiation of white blood cells at the promyelocyte stage. As a result, excess promyelocytes accumulate in the bone marrow and normal white blood cells cannot form, leading to acute promyelocytic leukemia. "
1030,PMM2 ,phosphomannomutase 2,"The PMM2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2). This enzyme is involved in a process called glycosylation, which attaches groups of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) to proteins. Oligosaccharides are made up of many small sugar molecules that are attached to one another in a long chain. Glycosylation modifies proteins so they can perform a wider variety of functions. In one of the early steps of glycosylation, the PMM2 enzyme converts a molecule called mannose-6-phosphate to mannose-1-phosphate. Subsequently, mannose-1-phosphate is converted into GDP-mannose, which can transfer its small sugar molecule called mannose to the growing oligosaccharide chain. Once the correct number of small sugar molecules are linked together to form the oligosaccharide, it can be attached to a protein.","PMM2-congenital disorder of glycosylation More than 115 mutations in the PMM2 gene have been found to cause PMM2-congenital disorder of glycosylation (PMM2-CDG, also known as congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ia). This is a severe condition that is characterized by developmental delay, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), abnormal distribution of fat, and various other signs and symptoms. The mutations that cause PMM2-CDG change the structure of the PMM2 enzyme in different ways; however, all of the mutations appear to result in reduced enzyme activity. Decreased activity of the PMM2 enzyme leads to a shortage of GDP-mannose within cells. As a result, there is not enough activated mannose to form oligosaccharides. Glycosylation cannot proceed normally because incorrect oligosaccharides are produced. The signs and symptoms in PMM2-CDG are likely due to the production of abnormally glycosylated proteins in many organs and tissues. "
1031,PMP22 ,peripheral myelin protein 22,"The PMP22 gene provides instructions for making a protein called peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22). This protein is found in the peripheral nervous system, which connects the brain and spinal cord to muscles and to sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and sound.The PMP22 protein is a component of myelin, a protective substance that covers nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. The protein is produced primarily by specialized cells called Schwann cells that wrap around and insulate nerves. Within Schwann cells, PMP22 plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of myelin. Studies suggest that the PMP22 protein is particularly important in protecting nerves from physical pressure, helping them restore their structure after being pinched or squeezed (compressed). Compression can interrupt nerve signaling, leading to the sensation commonly referred to as a limb ""falling asleep."" The ability of nerves to recover from normal, day-to-day compression, for example when sitting for long periods, keeps the limbs from constantly losing sensation. The PMP22 gene also plays a role in the growth of Schwann cells and the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation).Before they become part of myelin, newly produced PMP22 proteins are processed and packaged in specialized cell structures called the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Completion of these processing and packaging steps is critical for proper myelin function.","Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Mutations in the PMP22 gene cause several forms of a neurological disorder called Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. This disorder damages the peripheral nerves, which can result in loss of sensation and wasting (atrophy) of muscles in the feet, legs, and hands.An extra copy of the PMP22 gene in each cell caused by a duplication of genetic material on chromosome 17 is the most common genetic change that causes Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A). The extra gene leads to an overproduction of PMP22 protein. The connection between excess PMP22 protein and the signs and symptoms of CMT1A is unclear. Research suggests that excess PMP22 protein may overwhelm the cells' ability to process it correctly, leading to a buildup of unprocessed, nonfunctional protein. This buildup may impair the formation of myelin and disrupt other Schwann cell activities, leading to instability and loss of myelin (demyelination). Demyelination reduces the ability of the peripheral nerves to activate muscles used for movement or relay information from sensory cells back to the brain. Typically beginning in adolescence, affected individuals experience atrophy of the muscles of the lower legs and hands and decreased sensitivity to touch, heat, and cold.CMT1A is also caused by mutations that add, delete, or change the building blocks (amino acids) used to make PMP22 protein. The altered protein is probably processed at a slower rate, and some of the protein is processed abnormally. These disruptions of PMP22 processing impair the normal functions of the Schwann cell, leading to demyelination and producing the signs and symptoms of CMT1A.In addition to muscle and sensory problems, hearing loss is experienced by some people with a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease called type 1E (CMT1E). CMT1E is associated with particular amino acid substitutions and deletions in the PMP22 gene. The most frequently reported mutation causing hearing loss replaces the amino acid alanine with the amino acid proline at protein position 67 (also written as Ala67Pro).Some mutations in the PMP22 gene cause a severe form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease sometimes referred to as Dejerine-Sottas disease or type 3 Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. This form of the disorder usually begins in infancy, causing muscle weakness and atrophy and delayed development of motor skills such as walking. The mutations that cause this form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are thought to reduce the amount of functional PMP22 protein in cells. It is unclear why they cause more severe features than the mutations that cause CMT1A. Studies suggest that cell function is sensitive to the amount of PMP22 protein, and that having either too much or too little of this protein can cause disease. "
1032,PMS2 ,"PMS1 homolog 2, mismatch repair system component",The PMS2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an essential role in repairing DNA. This protein helps fix errors that are made when DNA is copied (DNA replication) in preparation for cell division. The PMS2 protein joins with another protein called MLH1 (produced from the MLH1 gene) to form a protein complex. This complex coordinates the activities of other proteins that repair errors made during DNA replication. Repairs are made by removing the section of DNA that contains errors and replacing it with a corrected DNA sequence. The PMS2 gene is a member of a set of genes known as the mismatch repair (MMR) genes.,"Lynch syndrome Mutations in the PMS2 gene have been reported in about 2 percent of families with Lynch syndrome that have an identified gene mutation. Lynch syndrome increases the risk of many types of cancer, particularly cancers of the colon (large intestine) and rectum, which are collectively referred to as colorectal cancer. People with Lynch syndrome also have an increased risk of cancers of the endometrium (lining of the uterus), ovaries, stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder duct, upper urinary tract, and brain. PMS2 gene mutations involved in this condition lead to the production of an abnormally short or inactive PMS2 protein that cannot efficiently repair errors made during DNA replication. The errors accumulate as the cells continue to divide, which may cause the cells to function abnormally, increasing the risk of tumor formation in the colon or another part of the body.Some mutations in the PMS2 gene can cause a variant of Lynch syndrome called Turcot syndrome. In addition to colorectal cancer, people with Turcot syndrome tend to develop a particular type of brain tumor called a glioblastoma. "
1033,PNKD ,"PNKD, MBL domain containing","Researchers have not determined the role of the PNKD gene (frequently called the MR1 gene) in the human body. This gene is highly active (expressed) in the brain, which suggests that it plays an important role in normal brain function. The protein produced from the PNKD gene may help control the release of chemicals called neurotransmitters, which allow nerve cells (neurons) to communicate with one another.The PNKD protein is similar to another protein that helps break down a chemical called methylglyoxal. Methylglyoxal is found in alcoholic beverages, coffee, tea, and cola. Research has demonstrated that this chemical is toxic to nerve cells (neurons). The PNKD protein may perform a function similar to this protein.","Familial paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia At least three mutations in the PNKD gene have been shown to cause familial paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia, which is characterized by episodes of involuntary movement. The two most common mutations, each found in several affected families, replace the protein building block (amino acid) alanine with the amino acid valine in the PNKD protein. One of the mutations occurs at position 7 (written as Ala7Val or A7V), and the other mutation is at position 9 (written as Ala9Val or A9V). Research suggests that the PNKD gene mutations alter the structure of the PNKD protein and interfere with its ability to function. It is not known how mutations in the PNKD gene lead to the signs and symptoms of familial paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia. "
1034,PNKP ,polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase,"The PNKP gene provides instructions for making the polynucleotide kinase-phosphatase (PNKP) enzyme. This enzyme is critical for repairing broken strands of DNA molecules. It can help fix damage that affects one DNA strand (single-strand breaks) or both strands (double-strand breaks). At the site of the damage, the PNKP enzyme modifies the broken ends of the DNA strands so that they can be joined back together.","Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia At least nine PNKP gene mutations have been found to cause ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 4. This condition is characterized by poor coordination and balance (ataxia) and problems with side-to-side movement of the eyes (oculomotor apraxia). These problems are due to the breakdown (degeneration) of nerve cells in the part of the brain that coordinates movement (the cerebellum).PNKP gene mutations that cause ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 4 lead to production of an unstable enzyme that is quickly broken down in the cell. Shortage of the PNKP enzyme prevents efficient repair of damaged DNA. Researchers suggest that the repair of single-strand breaks is particularly impaired in ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 4. It is thought that single-strand DNA damage increases after birth as the brain grows. Without repair, the accumulating damage leads to a loss of nerve cell in the brain, resulting in the movement problems characteristic of ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 4. "
1035,PNP ,purine nucleoside phosphorylase,"The PNP gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called purine nucleoside phosphorylase. This enzyme is found throughout the body but is most active in certain white blood cells called lymphocytes. These cells protect the body against potentially harmful invaders, such as bacteria or viruses. Lymphocytes are produced in specialized lymphoid tissues including the thymus and lymph nodes, and then released into the blood. The thymus is a gland located behind the breastbone; lymph nodes are found throughout the body. Lymphocytes in the blood and in lymphoid tissues are a major component of the immune system.Purine nucleoside phosphorylase is known as a housekeeping enzyme because it clears away waste molecules called deoxyinosine and deoxyguanosine, which are generated when DNA is broken down. Specifically, purine nucleoside phosphorylase converts deoxyinosine to another molecule called hypoxanthine, and converts deoxyguanosine to another molecule called guanine.","Purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency More than 35 PNP gene mutations have been identified in individuals with purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency, which is an immune system disorder in which the body is unable to fight foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. Affected individuals have repeated infections that can be life-threatening. Some people with purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency also have neurological problems, such as intellectual disability or difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia).Most of the PNP gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the purine nucleoside phosphorylase enzyme. The mutations reduce or eliminate the activity of purine nucleoside phosphorylase. The resulting excess of waste molecules and further reactions involving them lead to the buildup of a substance called deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) to levels that are toxic to lymphocytes.A type of lymphocytes known as T cells are particularly vulnerable to a toxic buildup of dGTP, particularly immature T cells in the thymus. The dGTP damages these cells and triggers their self-destruction (apoptosis). Lymphocytes in other lymphoid tissues can also be damaged. The shortage of lymphocytes results in the immune problems that cause vulnerability to severe infections. Damage to brain cells caused by buildup of dGTP is thought to underlie the neurological problems that occur in some people with purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency. "
1036,PNPLA2 ,patatin like phospholipase domain containing 2,"The PNPLA2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). The ATGL enzyme plays a role in breaking down fats called triglycerides, which are the main source of stored energy in cells. Triglycerides are the major component of cell structures called lipid droplets (also called adiposomes). The ATGL enzyme is found on the surface of lipid droplets. When activated, the ATGL enzyme breaks down triglycerides to provide energy for the body.","Neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy At least five mutations in the PNPLA2 gene have been found to cause neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy. Some of these mutations cause the enzyme to function abnormally. Other mutations prevent the enzyme from ever reaching lipid droplets, so it is unable to interact with triglycerides. Any disruption in the breakdown of triglycerides leads to the accumulation of these fats in muscle and other tissues throughout the body, resulting in the signs and symptoms of neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy. "
1037,PNPLA3 ,patatin like phospholipase domain containing 3,"The PNPLA3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called adiponutrin, which is found in fat cells (adipocytes) and liver cells (hepatocytes). The liver is a part of the digestive system that helps break down food, store energy, and remove waste products, including toxins. The function of the adiponutrin protein is not well understood, but it is thought to help regulate the development of adipocytes and the production and breakdown of fats (lipogenesis and lipolysis) in hepatocytes and adipocytes. Studies indicate that the activity (expression) of the PNPLA3 gene decreases during periods without food (fasting) and increases after eating, suggesting that the amount of adiponutrin protein produced is regulated as needed to help process and store fats in the diet.","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease A particular variation in the PNPLA3 gene has been associated with an increased risk of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is a buildup of excessive fat in the liver that can lead to liver damage resembling the damage caused by alcohol abuse, but that occurs in people who do not drink heavily. In some cases NAFLD leads to inflammation of the liver (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, also known as NASH) and permanent liver damage (cirrhosis).The PNPLA3 gene variation associated with NAFLD changes the protein building block (amino acid) isoleucine to the amino acid methionine at protein position 148, written as Ile148Met or I148M. Research suggests that the altered protein leads to increased production and decreased breakdown of fats in the liver. Studies are ongoing to determine how this and other genetic changes contribute to the development of NAFLD and its complications. "
1038,PNPLA6 ,patatin like phospholipase domain containing 6,"The PNPLA6 gene provides instructions for making a protein called neuropathy target esterase (NTE). The NTE protein is involved in the breakdown of certain fats (lipids). Specifically, NTE breaks down a lipid called lysophosphatidylcholine, which is one of several compounds found in the outer membranes surrounding cells. The correct levels of these compounds are critical to the stability of the cell membranes.The NTE protein is found most abundantly in the nervous system. It plays an important role in maintaining the stability of the membranes surrounding nerve cells (neurons) and of these cells' specialized extensions, called axons, that transmit nerve impulses. NTE may also play a role in the release of hormones from the pituitary gland, a process that requires particular changes in the cell membrane and appears to involve the lipids found there. The pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain and produces several hormones, including those that help direct sexual development and growth.","Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome More than a dozen mutations in the PNPLA6 gene have been found to cause Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome, a disorder characterized by coordination and balance problems (ataxia), vision impairment, and delayed puberty. The mutations are thought to impair the function of the NTE protein. Researchers are unsure how such a reduction in function leads to the signs and symptoms of the condition. They speculate that impairment of lysophosphatidylcholine metabolism alters the balance of compounds in the cell membrane. This imbalance may damage axons, leading to the movement and vision problems that characterize Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome. The imbalance is also thought to impair the release of hormones involved in sexual development, accounting for the delayed puberty in affected individuals. "
1039,PNPO ,pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase,"The PNPO gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase. This enzyme is involved in the breakdown (metabolism) of vitamin B6. Specifically, it chemically modifies two forms of vitamin B6 derived from food (pyridoxine and pyridoxamine) to form pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). PLP is the active form of vitamin B6 and is necessary for many processes in the body, including protein metabolism and the production of chemicals that transmit signals in the brain (neurotransmitters). Pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase is active (expressed) in cells throughout the body, with the highest amounts found in the liver.","Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent epilepsy At least 7 mutations in the PNPO gene have been found to cause pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent epilepsy. Most of these mutations change one protein building block (amino acid) in the pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase enzyme, impairing its normal function. The resulting enzyme cannot effectively metabolize pyridoxine and pyridoxamine to produce PLP. A shortage of PLP can disrupt the function of many other proteins and enzymes that need PLP in order to be effective. It is not clear how the lack of PLP affects the brain and leads to the seizures that are characteristic of this condition. "
1040,POFUT1 ,protein O-fucosyltransferase 1,"The POFUT1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called protein O-fucosyltransferase 1. This protein is located in a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which helps with protein processing and transport. Protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 adds sugar molecules, specifically a sugar called fucose, to other proteins called Notch receptors. Notch receptors are a family of proteins that are involved in a signaling pathway that guides normal development of many tissues throughout the body, both before birth and throughout life. Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. Attachment of a ligand into a Notch receptor triggers signaling in the pathway.The addition of fucose molecules alters the shape of the Notch receptor. The receptor is then able to attach (bind) to its ligand and trigger signaling. Through its integral role in Notch receptor function, protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 allows the Notch pathway to proceed. The Notch pathway regulates a variety of processes including the specialization of cells into certain cell types that perform particular functions in the body (cell fate determination). It also plays a role in cell growth and division (proliferation), maturation (differentiation), and self-destruction (apoptosis).In skin cells, Notch signaling likely plays a role in the maintenance of precursor cells that mature into pigment-producing skin cells called melanocytes and may regulate interactions between melanocytes and other skin cells called keratinocytes.","Dowling-Degos disease At least 13 mutations in the POFUT1 gene have been found to cause Dowling-Degos disease. This condition results in various skin abnormalities, including a characteristic lacy pattern of abnormally dark skin coloring (hyperpigmentation) that occurs most often in the body's folds and creases.The POFUT1 gene mutations that cause Dowling-Degos disease either lead to an abnormally short protein with no function or change single protein building blocks (amino acids), resulting in a partial loss of protein function. As a result, protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 is less able or unable to add fucose molecules to Notch receptors. Without these sugar molecules, Notch receptors cannot bind to their ligands and the Notch pathway is halted. Because the varied functions of the Notch pathway affect many body systems and Dowling-Degos disease affects only the skin, it is unclear whether the signs and symptoms of this condition are due to impaired Notch signaling or disruption of an unknown function of protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 in melanocytes or other skin cells. "
1041,POGLUT1 ,protein O-glucosyltransferase 1,"The POGLUT1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called protein O-glucosyltransferase 1. This protein is located in a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which helps with protein processing and transport. Protein O-glucosyltransferase 1 adds sugar molecules, specifically a sugar called glucose, to other proteins called Notch receptors. Notch receptors are a family of proteins that are involved in a signaling pathway that guides normal development of many tissues throughout the body, both before birth and throughout life. Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. Attachment of a ligand into a Notch receptor triggers signaling in the Notch pathway.The addition of glucose molecules alters the shape of the Notch receptor. The receptor is then able to attach (bind) to its ligand and trigger signaling. Through its integral role in Notch receptor function, protein O-glucosyltransferase 1 allows the Notch pathway to proceed. The Notch pathway regulates a variety of processes including the specialization of cells into certain cell types that perform particular functions in the body (cell fate determination). It also plays a role in cell growth and division (proliferation), maturation (differentiation), and self-destruction (apoptosis).In skin cells, Notch signaling likely plays a role in the maintenance of precursor cells that mature into pigment-producing skin cells called melanocytes and may regulate interactions between melanocytes and other skin cells called keratinocytes. Protein O-glucosyltransferase 1 is found in high levels in skin cells, particularly in the outermost layer of skin (epidermis) where melanocytes are abundant, and may have additional functions in the skin besides its involvement in Notch signaling.","Dowling-Degos disease At least 11 mutations in the POGLUT1 gene have been found to cause Dowling-Degos disease. This condition results in various skin abnormalities, including a characteristic lacy pattern of abnormally dark skin coloring (hyperpigmentation) that occurs most often in the body's folds and creases.Most of the POGLUT1 gene mutations that cause Dowling-Degos disease lead to an abnormally short protein with no function or change single protein building blocks (amino acids) resulting in a partial loss of protein function. As a result, protein O-glucosyltransferase 1 is less able or unable to add glucose molecules to Notch receptors. Without these sugar molecules, Notch receptors cannot bind to their ligands and the Notch pathway is halted. Because the varied functions of the Notch pathway affect many body systems and Dowling-Degos disease affects only the skin, it is unclear whether the signs and symptoms of this condition are due to impaired Notch signaling or disruption of an unknown function of protein O-glucosyltransferase 1 in melanocytes or other skin cells. "
1042,POGZ ,pogo transposable element derived with ZNF domain,"The POGZ gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in the cell nucleus. The POGZ protein is part of a group known as zinc finger proteins, which contain one or more short regions called zinc finger domains. These regions include a specific pattern of protein building blocks (amino acids) and one or more charged atoms of zinc (zinc ions). The folded configuration of the zinc finger domain stabilizes the protein and allows it to attach (bind) to other molecules.In the cell nucleus, the POGZ protein attaches (binds) to chromatin, which is the network of DNA and proteins that packages DNA into chromosomes. Binding of the POGZ protein is part of the process that changes the structure of chromatin (chromatin remodeling) to alter how tightly regions of DNA are packaged. Chromatin remodeling is one way gene activity (expression) is regulated; when DNA is tightly packed gene expression is lower than when DNA is loosely packed. Regulation of gene expression by the POGZ protein is thought to be important to brain development, but the specific function of POGZ in the brain is not well understood.","White-Sutton syndrome At least 17 POGZ gene mutations have been found to cause White-Sutton syndrome. This disorder is characterized by intellectual disability, specific facial features, and other signs and symptoms affecting various parts of the body, particularly vision problems and gastrointestinal problems. Most affected individuals have features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a varied condition characterized by impaired social skills, communication problems, and repetitive behaviors. POGZ gene mutations are thought to impair the ability of the POGZ protein to bind to chromatin, leading to abnormal gene expression that affects development of the brain and other body systems. However, little is known about the specific changes in gene expression and how they lead to the development of intellectual disability and other signs and symptoms of White-Sutton syndrome. "
1043,POLG ,"DNA polymerase gamma, catalytic subunit","The POLG gene provides instructions for making the active piece, called the alpha subunit, of a protein called polymerase gamma (pol γ). To be most effective, the alpha subunit attaches to two copies of another protein called the beta subunit to form pol γ. Pol γ is a DNA polymerase, which is a type of enzyme that ""reads"" sequences of DNA and uses them as templates to produce new DNA. These enzymes are important for copying (replicating) cells' genetic material. DNA polymerases also play critical roles in DNA repair.Pol γ functions in mitochondria. Mitochondria are structures within cells in which a process called oxidative phosphorylation converts the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Mitochondria each contain a small amount of DNA, known as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is essential for the normal function of these structures. Pol γ is the only DNA polymerase that is active in mitochondria and that can replicate mtDNA.","Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome There are many mutations in the POLG gene that cause Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome. Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome is part of a group of conditions called POLG-related disorders that have overlapping signs and symptoms affecting muscle-, nerve-, and brain-related functions. Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome is characterized by seizures, loss of mental and movement abilities (psychomotor regression), and liver disease. The liver disease in Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome can be brought on or made worse by valproic acid, a common treatment for seizures.Most POLG gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the alpha subunit of pol γ. The mutations can have several effects on the function of pol γ. The alpha subunit may lose the ability to attach to the beta subunits to form pol γ. Alternately, mutated pol γ may be unable to bind the existing mtDNA strand to use as a template. Or, it may have a reduced ability to attract the DNA building blocks (nucleotides) that it uses to form new DNA. These effects impair DNA synthesis and may lead to insertion of the wrong nucleotide and decreased ability to fix the error.The most common POLG gene mutation in Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome replaces the amino acid alanine with the amino acid threonine at position 467 (written as Ala467Thr or A467T). This mutation blocks the ability of the alpha subunit to attach to the beta subunits and reduces pol γ's ability to synthesize DNA. The Ala467Thr mutation is also common in other POLG-related disorders. The different conditions may be determined, in part, by the mutation in the other copy of POLG, but there are still some mutation combinations that can cause more than one of the disorders. It is unclear how the same mutation can lead to different conditions.Although the mechanism is unknown, many people with Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome have fewer copies of mtDNA (mtDNA depletion). This abnormality is seen only in the tissues affected by the disease. MtDNA depletion leads to impaired oxidative phosphorylation and a decrease in cellular energy. These impairments affect tissues whose cells do not divide continually, such as brain, muscle, and liver. These tissues are most affected because they are more dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for energy, and impaired cells in these tissues are not generally replaced by new cells. The lack of energy supplies in these tissues could account for the signs and symptoms of Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome. "
1044,POLH ,DNA polymerase eta,"The POLH gene provides instructions for making a protein called DNA polymerase eta. DNA polymerases are a group of enzymes that ""read"" sequences of DNA and use them as templates to produce new DNA. These enzymes are important for copying (replicating) cells' genetic material in preparation for cell division. DNA polymerases also play critical roles in DNA repair.The major function of DNA polymerase eta is to replicate DNA that has been damaged, particularly by ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight. Most other DNA polymerases are unable to replicate DNA with this type of damage. When they reach a segment of damaged DNA, they get stuck and the replication process stalls. However, when DNA polymerase eta encounters damaged DNA, it skips over the abnormal segment and continues copying. This activity, which is known as translesion synthesis, allows cells to tolerate some abnormalities created by UV exposure. Without this tolerance, unrepaired DNA damage would block DNA replication and cause the cell to die. Therefore, DNA polymerase eta plays an essential role in protecting cells from some of the effects of DNA damage.DNA polymerase eta is a relatively ""error-prone"" polymerase. When it bypasses damaged DNA, it often inserts an incorrect DNA building block (nucleotide). This type of error results in a mutation in the replicated DNA.","Xeroderma pigmentosum More than 30 mutations in the POLH gene have been found to cause the variant type of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP-V). Like the other forms of xeroderma pigmentosum, XP-V is characterized by an increased sensitivity to UV rays from sunlight. However, this form of the disorder is typically not associated with neurological abnormalities such as delayed development and hearing loss.Most POLH gene mutations prevent the production of any detectable DNA polymerase eta. A loss of this enzyme prevents cells from replicating damaged DNA effectively. Without this mechanism for tolerating DNA damage, errors resulting from exposure to UV rays accumulate in genes that control cell growth and division. These errors cause cells to grow too fast and in an uncontrolled way. As a result, people with XP-V have an increased risk of developing skin cancer in areas where the skin is exposed to sunlight. "
1045,POLR1C ,RNA polymerase I and III subunit C,"The POLR1C gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of two related enzymes called RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase III. These enzymes are involved in the production (synthesis) of ribonucleic acid (RNA), a chemical cousin of DNA. Both enzymes help synthesize a form of RNA known as ribosomal RNA (rRNA). RNA polymerase III also plays a role in the synthesis of several other forms of RNA, including transfer RNA (tRNA). Ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA assemble protein building blocks (amino acids) into functioning proteins, which is essential for the normal functioning and survival of cells.Based on its involvement in Treacher Collins syndrome, the POLR1C gene appears to play a critical role in the early development of structures that become bones and other tissues of the face.","Treacher Collins syndrome At least six mutations in the POLR1C gene have been identified in people with Treacher Collins syndrome, a condition that affects the development of bones and other tissues of the face. These mutations appear to alter the structure and function of the POLR1C protein, which reduces the amount of functional RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase III in cells. Consequently, less rRNA is produced. Researchers speculate that a shortage of rRNA may trigger the self-destruction (apoptosis) of certain cells involved in the early development of facial bones and tissues. The abnormal cell death could underlie the specific problems with facial development found in Treacher Collins syndrome. However, it is unclear why the effects of a reduction in rRNA are limited to facial development. "
1046,POLR1D ,RNA polymerase I and III subunit D,"The POLR1D gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of two related enzymes called RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase III. These enzymes are involved in the production (synthesis) of ribonucleic acid (RNA), a chemical cousin of DNA. Both enzymes help synthesize a form of RNA known as ribosomal RNA (rRNA).

These mutations appear to alter the structure and function of the POLR1D protein, which reduces the amount of functional RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase III in cells. Consequently, less rRNA is produced.

The abnormal cell death could underlie the specific problems with facial development found in Treacher Collins syndrome. However, it is unclear why the effects of a reduction in rRNA are limited to facial development. "
1047,POLR3A ,RNA polymerase III subunit A,"The POLR3A gene provides instructions for making the largest piece (subunit) of an enzyme called RNA polymerase III. This enzyme is involved in the production (synthesis) of ribonucleic acid (RNA), a chemical cousin of DNA. The RNA polymerase III enzyme attaches (binds) to DNA and synthesizes RNA molecules in accordance with the instructions carried by the DNA, a process called transcription. RNA polymerase III helps synthesize several forms of RNA, including ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA). Molecules of rRNA and tRNA assemble protein building blocks (amino acids) into working proteins; this process is essential for the normal functioning and survival of cells.","Pol III-related leukodystrophy At least 70 POLR3A gene mutations have been associated with Pol III-related leukodystrophy. Leukodystrophies are conditions that involve abnormalities of the nervous system's white matter. White matter consists of nerve fibers covered by a fatty substance called myelin, which insulates nerve fibers and promotes the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. A reduced ability to form myelin (hypomyelination) leads to the signs and symptoms of Pol III-related leukodystrophy, which include intellectual disability and difficulty with coordinating movements (ataxia). Development of the teeth (dentition) is also abnormal in this disorder.In Pol III-related leukodystrophy, POLR3A gene mutations may impair the ability of the subunits of the RNA polymerase III enzyme to assemble properly or result in an RNA polymerase III with impaired ability to bind to DNA. Reduced function of the RNA polymerase III molecule likely affects development and function of many parts of the body, but the relationship between POLR3A gene mutations and the specific signs and symptoms of this disorder is unknown.People with Pol III-related leukodystrophy may have different combinations of its signs and symptoms. These varied combinations of clinical features were originally described as separate disorders. Affected individuals may be diagnosed with ataxia, delayed dentition, and hypomyelination (ADDH); hypomyelination, hypodontia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (4H syndrome); tremor-ataxia with central hypomyelination (TACH); leukodystrophy with oligodontia (LO); or hypomyelination with cerebellar atrophy and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum (HCAHC). Because these disorders were later found to have the same genetic cause, researchers now group them as variations of the single condition Pol III-related leukodystrophy. "
1048,POLR3B ,RNA polymerase III subunit B,"The POLR3B gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of an enzyme called RNA polymerase III. This enzyme is involved in the production (synthesis) of ribonucleic acid (RNA), a chemical cousin of DNA. The RNA polymerase III enzyme attaches (binds) to DNA and synthesizes RNA in accordance with the instructions carried by the DNA, a process called transcription.

Because these disorders were later found to have the same genetic cause, researchers now group them as variations of the single condition Pol III-related leukodystrophy. "
1049,POMC ,proopiomelanocortin,"The POMC gene provides instructions for making a protein called proopiomelanocortin (POMC), which is cut (cleaved) into smaller pieces called peptides that have different functions in the body. The peptides attach (bind) to one of several proteins in different regions of the body, and this binding triggers signaling pathways that control many important functions.One peptide produced from the POMC protein is called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH binds to melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R), stimulating the release of a hormone called cortisol. This hormone helps maintain blood sugar levels, protects the body from stress, and stops (suppresses) inflammation.Three similar peptides called alpha-, beta-, and gamma-melanocyte stimulating hormones (α-, β-, and γ-MSH) are also cut from the POMC protein. The primary role of α-MSH is in the pigment-producing cells of the skin and hair (melanocytes), where it binds to melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R). This attachment stimulates the production and release of a pigment called melanin, which is the substance that gives skin and hair their color.The β-MSH peptide plays a role in weight regulation by binding to melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R). Signaling through this receptor in the brain helps maintain the balance between energy from food taken into the body and energy spent by the body. The correct balance is important to control eating and weight. The α-MSH peptide can also bind to MC4R and help maintain the correct energy balance.Studies show that γ-MSH binds to melanocortin 3 receptor (MC3R). Signaling stimulated by this interaction appears to be involved in regulating the amount of sodium in the body and controlling blood pressure, although the mechanism is unclear.Another peptide produced from POMC is β-endorphin. Attachment of β-endorphin to proteins in the brain called opioid receptors stimulates signaling for pain relief.","Proopiomelanocortin deficiency Several mutations in the POMC gene have been found in people with proopiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency. These gene mutations lead to production of an abnormally short version of the POMC protein or no protein at all. As a result, there is an absence of the peptides made from POMC, including ACTH, α-MSH, β-MSH, β-endorphin, and sometimes γ-MSH. Loss of these peptides prevents signaling through their receptor proteins and disrupts certain functions in the body. Without ACTH, there is a reduction in cortisol production, which leads to low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and other problems in affected individuals. Decreased α-MSH in the skin reduces pigment production in melanocytes, which results in the red hair and pale skin often seen in people with POMC deficiency. Loss of signaling in the brain stimulated by α-MSH and β-MSH dysregulates the body's energy balance, leading to overeating and severe obesity. Shortage of γ-MSH or β-endorphin does not seem to cause health problems in people with this condition. "
1050,POMT1 ,protein O-mannosyltransferase 1,"The POMT1 gene provides instructions for making one piece of the protein O-mannosyltransferase (POMT) enzyme complex. The other piece is produced from the POMT2 gene. This enzyme complex is present in many different tissues in the body but is particularly abundant in the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles), fetal brain, and testes.The POMT complex helps modify a protein called alpha (α)-dystroglycan. Specifically, this complex adds a sugar molecule called mannose to α-dystroglycan through a process called glycosylation. Glycosylation is critical for the normal function of α-dystroglycan.The α-dystroglycan protein helps anchor the structural framework inside each cell (cytoskeleton) to the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell (extracellular matrix). In skeletal muscles, glycosylated α-dystroglycan helps stabilize and protect muscle fibers. In the brain, it helps direct the movement (migration) of nerve cells (neurons) during early development.","Walker-Warburg syndrome At least 24 mutations in the POMT1 gene have been found to cause Walker-Warburg syndrome, the most severe form of a group of disorders known as congenital muscular dystrophies. Individuals with Walker-Warburg syndrome have skeletal muscle weakness and abnormalities of the brain and eyes. Because of the severity of the problems caused by this condition, affected individuals usually do not survive past early childhood.POMT1 gene mutations that cause Walker-Warburg syndrome lead to the formation of nonfunctional POMT enzyme complexes that cannot transfer mannose to α-dystroglycan, preventing its normal glycosylation. As a result, α-dystroglycan can no longer effectively anchor cells to the proteins and other molecules that surround them. Without functional α-dystroglycan to stabilize the muscle fibers, they become damaged as they repeatedly contract and relax with use. The damaged fibers weaken and die over time, which affects the development, structure, and function of skeletal muscles in people with Walker-Warburg syndrome.Defective α-dystroglycan also affects the migration of neurons during the early development of the brain. Instead of stopping when they reach their intended destinations, some neurons migrate past the surface of the brain into the fluid-filled space that surrounds it. Researchers believe that this problem with neuronal migration causes a brain abnormality called cobblestone lissencephaly, in which the surface of the brain lacks the normal folds and grooves and instead appears bumpy and irregular. Less is known about the effects of POMT1 gene mutations in other parts of the body. "
1051,POMT2 ,protein O-mannosyltransferase 2,"The POMT2 gene provides instructions for making one piece of the protein O-mannosyltransferase (POMT) enzyme complex. The other piece is produced from the POMT1 gene.

This condition is the most severe form of a group of disorders known as congenital muscular dystrophies. Walker-Warburg syndrome causes muscle weakness and abnormalities of the brain and eyes.

Less is known about the effects of POMT2 gene mutations in other parts of the body. "
1052,POR ,cytochrome p450 oxidoreductase,"The POR gene provides instructions for making the enzyme cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase. This enzyme is required for the normal functioning of more than 50 enzymes in the cytochrome P450 family. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in the formation (synthesis) and breakdown (metabolism) of various molecules and chemicals within cells.Cytochrome P450 enzymes are critical for the synthesis of cholesterol and steroid hormones. Cholesterol is a substance that has many essential functions both before and after birth, including roles in the production of steroid hormones and in the formation and growth of bones. Steroid hormones are needed for normal development and reproduction. This group of hormones includes testosterone and estrogen, which are essential for normal sexual development and reproduction; corticosteroids, which are involved in the body's response to stress; and aldosterone, which helps regulate the body's salt and water balance.Additionally, cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in the metabolism of ingested substances, such as medications, in the liver. Because cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase helps regulate the activity of these enzymes, researchers suspect that normal variations in the POR gene may influence a person's response to particular drugs (drug metabolism).","Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency More than 50 mutations in the POR gene have been found to cause cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency. This condition causes hormonal changes that can affect the development of the reproductive system, skeleton, and other parts of the body. The disorder affects sexual development before birth and at puberty, and severe cases are also characterized by skeletal abnormalities.Most of the mutations that cause cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase. POR gene mutations significantly reduce the enzyme's activity, which disrupts the production of steroid hormones. Changes in sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogen lead to problems with sexual development.Reduced activity of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase can also disrupt the production of cholesterol, which likely impairs normal bone formation in severe cases of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase deficiency. Studies suggest that a molecule called retinoic acid also plays a role in the skeletal abnormalities found in severe cases. The breakdown of retinoic acid requires cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase; if a shortage of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase prevents retinoic acid from being broken down, the resulting excess of that molecule can stimulate the abnormal growth and fusion of bones.It is unclear whether mutations in the POR gene affect how the liver processes medications. The role of this enzyme in drug metabolism is an active area of research. "
1053,PORCN ,porcupine O-acyltransferase,"The PORCN gene provides instructions for making a protein that belongs to a group of related proteins called the porcupine (Porc) family. Although the precise function of the PORCN protein is unknown, proteins in the Porc family are involved in the process of transferring a molecule called palmitoleic acid to Wnt proteins. Wnt proteins participate in chemical signaling pathways in the body and play critical roles in development before birth. Members of the Porc family are located in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is a structure inside the cell that is involved in protein processing and transport. The transfer of palmitoleic acid to Wnt proteins facilitates the release of these proteins from the cell so they can regulate development of the skin, bones, and other structures. Researchers are working to determine the specific role of the PORCN protein within human cells.","Focal dermal hypoplasia At least 29 mutations in the PORCN gene have been found to cause focal dermal hypoplasia. These mutations may alter the protein's structure, lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the protein, or delete the entire PORCN gene. All of these mutations appear to result in the absence of any functional PORCN protein. Researchers believe Wnt proteins cannot be released from the cell without the PORCN protein. When Wnt proteins are unable to leave the cell, they cannot participate in the chemical signaling pathways that are critical for normal development. "
1054,POU3F4 ,POU class 3 homeobox 4,"The POU3F4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps regulate the activity of other genes. Based on this role, the protein is called a transcription factor. The POU3F4 gene is part of a larger family of transcription factor genes called POU domain genes. These genes play a role in determining cell types in the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system) during early development. The proteins produced from genes in the POU domain family each include two regions, called the POU-specific domain and POU homeodomain, that bind to the DNA of other genes.The POU3F4 protein is likely to be involved in the development of the middle and inner ear, and it is also active in certain regions of the brain before birth. Researchers are working to determine which genes are regulated by this protein.","Nonsyndromic hearing loss Mutations involving the POU3F4 gene cause nonsyndromic hearing loss, which is a loss of hearing that is not associated with other signs and symptoms. Mutations in this gene cause a form of hearing loss designated as DFNX2, sometimes also known as Nance deafness. DFNX2 is the most common type of X-linked nonsyndromic hearing loss, accounting for about half of all cases. X-linked conditions are caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes.The signs and symptoms of DFNX2 differ in males and females. In males, this form of hearing loss begins before the child learns to speak (prelingual), becomes more severe over time, and usually involves abnormalities of both the inner ear and the middle ear (mixed hearing loss). In the middle ear, one of the small bones (the stapes) cannot move normally, which interferes with hearing. This characteristic sign of DFNX2 is called stapes fixation. During surgery to repair this abnormality, affected males are at high risk of a complication called a perilymphatic gusher, which is a leakage of fluid from the inner ear that can result in a permanent, total loss of hearing. Females with POU3F4 gene mutations tend to be less severely affected, with little or no hearing loss and no apparent middle ear abnormalities. When hearing loss occurs, it usually begins after the child learns to speak (postlingual).More than 50 POU3F4 gene mutations have been found to cause DFNX2. Many of these genetic changes alter single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the POU3F4 protein or delete part or all of the POU3F4 gene. In some cases, mutations have been found in DNA near the POU3F4 gene. Researchers believe that this DNA may play a role in regulating the POU3F4 gene. Mutations in or near this gene prevent cells from producing any POU3F4 protein or impair regions of the protein that are critical for binding to DNA. A lack of functional POU3F4 protein probably disrupts the normal development of structures in the middle and inner ear, leading to hearing loss. "
1055,PPOX ,protoporphyrinogen oxidase,"The PPOX gene provides instructions for making an enzyme known as protoporphyrinogen oxidase. This enzyme is involved in the production of a molecule called heme. Heme is vital for all of the body's organs, although it is most abundant in the blood, bone marrow, and liver. Heme is an essential component of iron-containing proteins called hemoproteins, including hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in the blood).The production of heme is a multi-step process that requires eight different enzymes. Protoporphyrinogen oxidase is responsible for the seventh step in this process, in which two hydrogen atoms are removed from protoporphyrinogen IX (the product of the sixth step) to form protoporphyrin IX. In the final step, another enzyme modifies protoporphyrin IX by inserting an iron atom to produce heme.","Porphyria More than 130 mutations in the PPOX gene have been identified in people with a form of porphyria called variegate porphyria. A particular PPOX gene mutation is found in about 95 percent of South African families with this form of the disorder. The mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in protoporphyrinogen oxidase, replacing the amino acid arginine with the amino acid tryptophan at position 59 (written as Arg59Trp or R59W).Mutations in the PPOX gene reduce the activity of protoporphyrinogen oxidase, allowing compounds called porphyrin precursors to build up in the body. These compounds are formed during the normal process of heme production, but reduced activity of protoporphyrinogen oxidase allows them to accumulate to toxic levels. Nongenetic factors such as certain drugs, alcohol, dieting, as well as other genetic factors that have not been identified, also contribute to the characteristic features of variegate porphyria. "
1056,PPP2R5D ,protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit B'delta,"The PPP2R5D gene provides instructions for making a protein called B56-delta (B56δ). This protein is one piece (the B subunit) of an enzyme called protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). (B56δ is one of several possible B subunits.) The PP2A enzyme removes phosphate groups, consisting of three oxygen atoms and one phosphorus atom, from certain proteins. This process, called dephosphorylation, helps control whether the protein is turned on or off. The B subunit determines which proteins are dephosphorylated by PP2A and regulates the activity of the enzyme.PP2A removes phosphate groups from proteins that are part of signaling pathways involved in cell growth and turning genes on and off. PP2A enzymes containing the B56δ protein are found mainly in the brain, where they are thought to be primarily involved in controlling the activity of signaling pathways that play roles in the normal development and function of nerve cells (neurons).","PPP2R5D-related intellectual disability At least seven PPP2R5D gene mutations have been found to cause moderate to severe intellectual disability. Individuals with PPP2R5D-related intellectual disability typically also have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and delayed development of speech and walking. These mutations affect one copy of the gene. They change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the B56δ protein. Although the effects of these changes are unclear, researchers suspect that they alter or impair the activity of the PP2A enzyme. Abnormal or reduced PP2A enzyme activity is thought to disrupt signaling pathways in neurons, impairing their normal development and functioning, which may underlie intellectual disability and other features of PPP2R5D-related intellectual disability. "
1057,PPT1 ,palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1,"The PPT1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1. This enzyme is found in structures called lysosomes, which are compartments within cells that break down and recycle different types of molecules. Palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 removes certain fats called long-chain fatty acids from specific proteins, typically a fatty acid called palmitate. Removing these fatty acids helps break the proteins down when they are no longer needed. Palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 is also thought to be involved in a variety of other cell functions, such as the development of synapses, which are the connections between nerve cells where cell-to-cell communication occurs.","CLN1 disease More than 65 mutations in the PPT1 gene have been found to cause CLN1 disease. This condition impairs mental and motor development causing difficulty with walking, speaking, and intellectual function. In addition, affected children often develop recurrent seizures (epilepsy) and vision loss. Signs and symptoms of CLN1 disease typically appear by age 18 months but can begin later, sometimes in adulthood, in some individuals.The PPT1 gene mutations that cause CLN1 disease decrease or eliminate the production or function of palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1. The most common mutation causing CLN1 disease worldwide, written as Arg151Ter or R151X, replaces the protein building block (amino acid) arginine with a premature stop signal in the instructions used to make the enzyme. This mutation results in an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the enzyme. Another mutation causes most cases of the disorder in people of Finnish descent; this genetic change replaces arginine with the amino acid tryptophan at position 122 in the palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 enzyme (written as Arg122Trp or R122W).PPT1 gene mutations that cause CLN1 disease lead to a shortage of functional enzyme, which impairs the removal of long-chain fatty acids from certain proteins. These partially broken down fats and proteins accumulate in lysosomes. While accumulations of these substances occurs in cells throughout the body, nerve cells appear to be particularly vulnerable to damage caused by the abnormal cell materials. Early and widespread loss of nerve cells in CLN1 disease leads to severe signs and symptoms and death in childhood.In the later-onset cases of CLN1 disease, PPT1 gene mutations result in the production of a palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 enzyme that has a reduced level of normal function; however, protein function in these individuals is higher than in those who have the condition beginning in early childhood. As a result, long-chain fatty acids are removed from some proteins, allowing for a small amount of proteins to be broken down. Because it takes longer for these substances to accumulate in lysosomes and cause nerve cell death, the signs and symptoms of CLN1 disease in these individuals occur later in life. "
1058,PQBP1 ,polyglutamine binding protein 1,"The PQBP1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called polyglutamine-binding protein 1. This protein attaches (binds) to stretches of multiple copies of a protein building block (amino acid) called glutamine in certain other proteins.While the specific function of polyglutamine-binding protein 1 is not well understood, it is believed to play a role in processing and transporting RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA that serves as the genetic blueprint for the production of proteins.In nerve cells (neurons) such as those in the brain, polyglutamine-binding protein 1 is found in structures called RNA granules. These granules allow the transport and storage of RNA within the cell. The RNA is held within the granules until the genetic information it carries is translated to produce proteins or until cellular signals or environmental factors trigger the RNA to be degraded. Through these mechanisms, polyglutamine-binding protein 1 is thought to help control the way genetic information is used (gene expression) in neurons. This control is important for normal brain development.","Renpenning syndrome At least 14 PQBP1 gene mutations have been identified in people with Renpenning syndrome, a disorder that occurs almost exclusively in males and causes intellectual disability and characteristic physical features. Most of the PQBP1 gene mutations that cause Renpenning syndrome result in an abnormally short polyglutamine-binding protein 1. The function of a shortened or otherwise abnormal protein is likely impaired and interferes with normal gene expression in neurons, resulting in abnormal development of the brain and the signs and symptoms of Renpenning syndrome. "
1059,PRF1 ,perforin 1,"The PRF1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called perforin. This protein is found in immune cells (lymphocytes) called T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, which destroy other cells. Perforin is involved in the process of cell destruction (cytolysis) and the regulation of the immune system.Perforin is a major component of structures called cytolytic granules within T cells and NK cells. One of the main ways in which T cells and NK cells destroy other cells is to transport and secrete these cytolytic granules, which contain cell-killing proteins, onto the membranes of the target cells. Perforin helps create a channel through the membrane, allowing cytolytic proteins to enter the cell and trigger it to self-destruct.This cytolytic mechanism also helps regulate the immune system by destroying unneeded T cells. Controlling the number of T cells prevents the overproduction of immune proteins called cytokines that lead to inflammation and which, in excess, cause tissue damage.","Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis More than 90 PRF1 gene mutations have been identified in people with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. These mutations result in the production of a defective perforin protein or prevent the production of perforin. The resulting shortage of functional perforin prevents it from carrying out its role in cell destruction and immune system regulation, leading to the exaggerated immune response characteristic of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.

1060,PRICKLE1 ,prickle planar cell polarity protein 1,"The PRICKLE1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called prickle homolog 1. The function of this protein is unclear, although it appears to play an important role in the development of the nervous system. Prickle homolog 1 is likely part of a chemical signaling pathway known as noncanonical Wnt signaling. During development before birth, noncanonical Wnt signaling helps to determine the position of various components within cells (cell polarity). This pathway also regulates the movement of nerve cells (neurons) in the developing nervous system.Studies suggest that prickle homolog 1 interacts with other proteins, including RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST). The REST protein regulates several critical genes in neurons by turning off (suppressing) their activity. To regulate these genes, REST must enter the nucleus and attach (bind) to particular regions of DNA. Researchers believe that prickle homolog 1 controls REST by transporting it out of the nucleus, which prevents it from binding to DNA and suppressing gene activity. It remains unclear how the interaction between prickle homolog 1 and REST contributes to the normal development of the nervous system.","PRICKLE1-related progressive myoclonus epilepsy with ataxia At least three mutations in the PRICKLE1 gene have been identified in people with PRICKLE1-related progressive myoclonus epilepsy with ataxia. Each mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the prickle homolog 1 protein. One of the known mutations appears to disrupt the interaction between prickle homolog 1 and REST, blocking the transport of REST out of the nucleus. As a result, REST may inappropriately suppress certain genes in the developing nervous system. It is unclear how mutations in the PRICKLE1 gene lead to movement problems, seizures, and the other features of PRICKLE1-related progressive myoclonus epilepsy with ataxia. "
1061,PRKAG2 ,protein kinase AMP-activated non-catalytic subunit gamma 2,"The PRKAG2 gene provides instructions for making one part (the gamma-2 subunit) of a larger enzyme called AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This enzyme helps sense and respond to energy demands within cells. It is active in many different tissues, including heart (cardiac) muscle and muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). AMP-activated protein kinase is likely involved in the development of the heart before birth, although its role in this process is unknown.AMP-activated protein kinase regulates chemical pathways involving the cell's main energy source, a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The breakdown of ATP releases energy to drive many types of chemical reactions. AMP-activated protein kinase is activated during times of cellular stress (such as low oxygen levels or muscle exercise), when ATP is broken down rapidly to produce energy. If ATP levels become too low, the enzyme restores the balance of energy by limiting chemical reactions that require ATP and stimulating pathways that generate ATP.Studies suggest that AMP-activated protein kinase may play a role in controlling the activity of other genes, although many of these genes have not been identified. The enzyme may also regulate the activity of certain ion channels in the heart. These channels, which transport positively charged atoms (ions) into and out of heart muscle cells, play critical roles in maintaining the heart's normal rhythm.","Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome At least seven mutations that cause Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome have been identified in the PRKAG2 gene. Some people with these mutations also have features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a form of heart disease that enlarges and weakens the heart (cardiac) muscle. Researchers are uncertain how PRKAG2 mutations lead to the development of these heart conditions. Research suggests that these mutations alter the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase in the heart, disrupting the enzyme's ability to respond to changes in cellular energy demands. It is unclear, however, whether the genetic changes overactivate the enzyme or reduce its activity.Studies indicate that changes in AMP-activated protein kinase activity allow a complex sugar called glycogen to build up abnormally within cardiac muscle cells. The accumulation of this substance enlarges these cells, which may lead to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Researchers continue to investigate whether an abnormal buildup of glycogen in the heart is also responsible for the problems with electrical signaling that are characteristic of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.Other studies have found that altered AMP-activated protein kinase activity is related to changes in the regulation of certain ion channels in the heart. These changes may help explain the increased risk of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) in people with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. "
1062,PRKAR1A ,protein kinase cAMP-dependent type I regulatory subunit alpha,"The PRKAR1A gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of an enzyme called protein kinase A. This enzyme promotes cell growth and division (proliferation). Protein kinase A is made up of four protein subunits, two of which are called regulatory subunits because they control whether this enzyme is turned on or off. The PRKAR1A gene provides instructions for making one of these regulatory subunits, called type 1 alpha. Protein kinase A remains turned off when the regulatory subunits are attached to the other two subunits of the enzyme. In order to turn on protein kinase A, the regulatory subunits must break away from the enzyme.","Carney complex More than 117 mutations in the PRKAR1A gene have been found to cause Carney complex. Most of these mutations result in an abnormal type 1 alpha regulatory subunit that is quickly broken down (degraded) by the cell. The lack of this regulatory subunit causes protein kinase A to be turned on more often than normal, which leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation. The signs and symptoms of Carney complex are related to the unregulated growth of cells in many parts of the body. "
1063,PRKN ,parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase,"The PRKN gene, one of the largest human genes, provides instructions for making a protein called parkin. Parkin plays a role in the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unneeded proteins by tagging damaged and excess proteins with molecules called ubiquitin. Ubiquitin serves as a signal to move unneeded proteins into specialized cell structures known as proteasomes, where the proteins are degraded. The ubiquitin-proteasome system acts as the cell's quality control system by disposing of damaged, misshapen, and excess proteins. This system also regulates the availability of proteins that are involved in several critical cell activities, such as the timing of cell division and growth. Because of its activity in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, parkin belongs to a group of proteins called E3 ubiquitin ligases.Parkin appears to be involved in the maintenance of mitochondria, the energy-producing centers in cells. However, little is known about its role in mitochondrial function. Research suggests that parkin may help trigger the destruction of mitochondria that are not working properly.Studies of the structure and activity of parkin have led researchers to propose several additional activities for this protein. Parkin may act as a tumor suppressor protein, which means it prevents cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Parkin may also regulate the supply and release of sacs called synaptic vesicles from nerve cells. Synaptic vesicles contain chemical messengers that transmit signals from one nerve cell to another.","Parkinson disease Researchers have identified more than 200 PRKN gene mutations that cause Parkinson disease, a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement and balance. Mutations in this gene are associated with the juvenile form of Parkinson disease, which appears before age 20, and some cases of the more common, late-onset form that begins after age 50.Some PRKN gene mutations lead to an abnormally small parkin protein that is nonfunctional and is rapidly broken down (degraded) within cells. Other mutations insert, delete, or change DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the PRKN gene, leading to a defective version of the parkin protein or preventing the production of this protein. The PRKN gene mutations associated with Parkinson disease usually lead to a loss of parkin activity.It is unclear how PRKN gene mutations cause Parkinson disease. The loss of parkin activity probably disturbs the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which allows unneeded proteins to accumulate. A buildup of these proteins could disrupt normal cell activities such as the supply and release of synaptic vesicles, particularly those that contain a chemical messenger called dopamine. As parkin is normally abundant in the brain, its loss could lead to the impairment or death of nerve cells, including those that produce dopamine. Loss of dopamine-producing nerve cells is a characteristic feature of Parkinson disease.Mutations in the PRKN gene may also disrupt the regulation of mitochondria. Researchers speculate that mitochondrial dysfunction in dopamine-producing nerve cells may play an important role in causing the signs and symptoms of Parkinson disease. "
1064,PRKRA ,protein activator of interferon induced protein kinase EIF2AK2,"The PRKRA gene provides instructions for making a protein called PACT. This protein plays a role in the cell's response to stress, such as exposure to viruses, damaging molecules called free radicals, or other toxic substances. When a cell is under stress, the PACT protein turns on (activates) another protein called PKR, which then turns off (inactivates) the eIF2 alpha (eIF2α) protein. Inactivation of eIF2α lowers protein production, which helps protect cells from damage. The signals triggered by PACT can ultimately lead to self-destruction (apoptosis) of the cell if it remains under stress.The signals sent by the PACT protein are also important for a process in the brain called synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity is the ability of the connections between brain cells (synapses) to change and adapt over time in response to experience. This process is critical for learning and memory.","Dystonia 16 At least eight mutations in the PRKRA gene have been identified in people with dystonia 16. This condition is one of many forms of dystonia, which is a group of conditions characterized by involuntary movements, twisting (torsion) and tensing of various muscles, and unusual positioning of affected body parts.Most of the PRKRA gene mutations that cause dystonia 16 change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the PACT protein. Studies suggest that these changes alter the timing of signals sent by the PACT protein in response to stress. The abnormal signaling increases the rate at which cell death occurs. It is likely that the excessive loss of cells in certain regions of the brain impairs the brain's ability to control muscles and movement, resulting in the features of dystonia 16. It is unclear why brain cells are particularly affected by PRKRA gene mutations. "
1065,PRNP ,prion protein,"The PRNP gene provides instructions for making a protein called prion protein (PrP), which is active in the brain and several other tissues. Although the precise function of this protein is unknown, researchers have proposed roles in several important processes. These include the transport of copper into cells and protection of brain cells (neurons) from injury (neuroprotection). Studies have also suggested a role for PrP in the formation of synapses, which are the junctions between nerve cells (neurons) where cell-to-cell communication occurs.Different forms of PrP have been identified. The normal version is often designated PrPC to distinguish it from abnormal forms of the protein, which are generally designated PrPSc.","Huntington disease-like syndrome A particular type of mutation in the PRNP gene has been found to cause signs and symptoms that resemble those of Huntington disease, including uncontrolled movements, emotional problems, and loss of thinking ability. Researchers have proposed that this condition be called Huntington disease-like 1 (HDL1).The PRNP mutations associated with HDL1 involve a segment of DNA called an octapeptide repeat. This segment provides instructions for making eight protein building blocks (amino acids) that are linked to form a protein fragment called a peptide. The octapeptide repeat is normally repeated five times in the PRNP gene. In people with HDL1, this segment is repeated eleven or thirteen times. An increase in the size of the octapeptide repeat leads to the production of an abnormally long version of PrP. It is unclear how the abnormal protein damages and ultimately destroys neurons, leading to the characteristic features of HDL1. "
1066,PROC ,"protein C, inactivator of coagulation factors Va and VIIIa","The PROC gene provides instructions for making a protein called protein C that is important for controlling blood clotting. Protein C blocks the activity of two proteins that promote the formation of blood clots, called factor Va and factor VIIIa. Protein C is also involved in controlling inflammation. Inflammation is a normal body response to infection, irritation, or other injury.Protein C is made in the liver and then released into the bloodstream. The protein remains turned off (inactive) until it attaches to a protein called thrombin, which converts it to activated protein C (APC). APC cuts (cleaves) the factor Va protein at specific sites, which partially or completely inactivates factor Va. (The inactive form is called factor V.) APC then works with factor V to inactivate factor VIIIa.","Protein C deficiency At least 270 mutations in the PROC gene have been found to cause protein C deficiency. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in protein C, which disrupts its ability to control blood clotting. Protein C deficiency can be divided into type I and type II based on the mutation in the PROC gene.Protein C deficiency type I is caused by PROC gene mutations that result in reduced levels of protein C. Affected individuals do not have enough protein C to control blood clotting, which causes the increased risk for abnormal blood clots in protein C deficiency.Mutations that cause protein C deficiency type II result in the production of an altered protein C with reduced activity. Individuals with this form of the condition have normal levels of protein C, but the protein is not able to interact with other molecules involved in blood clotting. If protein C cannot control blood clotting, abnormal blood clots may form. "
1067,PRODH ,proline dehydrogenase 1,"The PRODH gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme proline oxidase (also known as proline dehydrogenase), which is found primarily in the brain, liver, and kidney. Within cells of these organs, this enzyme functions in energy-producing structures called mitochondria.Proline oxidase begins the process of breaking down the protein building block (amino acid) proline by starting the reaction that converts it to pyrroline-5-carboxylate. A subsequent step converts this intermediate product to the amino acid glutamate. The conversion between proline and glutamate is important in maintaining a supply of the amino acids needed for protein production, and for energy transfer within the cell.","Hyperprolinemia At least 15 mutations in the PRODH gene have been found to reduce the activity of the proline oxidase enzyme. These mutations substitute one amino acid for another amino acid in the enzyme, causing it to perform its function in proline breakdown (degradation) less efficiently. A reduction in proline oxidase function results in a buildup of proline in the body, and in severe cases of hyperprolinemia can cause seizures, intellectual disability, or other neurological or psychiatric problems. "
1068,PROK2 ,prokineticin 2,"The PROK2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called prokineticin 2. This protein interacts with another protein called prokineticin receptor 2 (produced from the PROKR2 gene). On the cell surface, prokineticin 2 attaches (binds) to the receptor like a key in a lock. When the two proteins are connected, they trigger a series of chemical signals within the cell that regulate various cell functions. Prokineticin 2 and its receptor are produced in many organs and tissues, including the small intestine, certain regions of the brain, and several hormone-producing (endocrine) tissues.Prokineticin 2 and its receptor play a role in the development of a group of nerve cells that are specialized to process smells (olfactory neurons). These neurons move (migrate) from the developing nose to a structure in the front of the brain called the olfactory bulb, which is critical for the perception of odors. Prokineticin 2 and its receptor are also involved in the migration of nerve cells that produce gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH controls the production of several hormones that direct sexual development before birth and during puberty. These hormones are also important for the normal function of the ovaries in women and the testes in men.Several additional functions of prokineticin 2 and its receptor have been discovered. These proteins help stimulate the movement of food through the intestine and are likely involved in the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). They also play a role in coordinating daily (circadian) rhythms, such as the sleep-wake cycle and regular changes in body temperature. Prokineticin 2 and its receptor are active in a region of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which acts as an internal clock that controls circadian rhythms.","Kallmann syndrome At least 16 mutations in the PROK2 gene have been identified in people with Kallmann syndrome, a disorder characterized by the combination of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (a condition affecting the production of hormones that direct sexual development) and an impaired sense of smell. Researchers estimate that mutations in the PROK2 and PROKR2 genes together account for about 9 percent of all cases of Kallmann syndrome.Most of the PROK2 gene mutations that cause Kallmann syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in prokineticin 2. These mutations disrupt the protein's activity, affecting its ability to bind to its receptor to send signals normally. Studies suggest that a loss of this signaling disrupts the migration and survival of olfactory neurons and GnRH-producing neurons in the developing brain. If olfactory nerve cells do not extend to the olfactory bulb, a person's sense of smell will be impaired or absent. Misplacement or premature loss of GnRH-producing neurons prevents the production of sex hormones, which interferes with normal sexual development and causes puberty to be delayed or absent.Because the features and severity of Kallmann syndrome vary among individuals, researchers believe that additional genetic and environmental factors may be involved. Some affected individuals have mutations in one of several other genes in addition to PROK2, and these genetic changes may contribute to the varied features of the condition. "
1069,PROKR2 ,prokineticin receptor 2,"The PROKR2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called prokineticin receptor 2. This receptor interacts with a protein called prokineticin 2 (produced from the PROK2 gene). On the cell surface, prokineticin 2 attaches to the receptor like a key in a lock. When the two proteins are connected, they trigger a series of chemical signals within the cell that regulate various cell functions. Prokineticin 2 and its receptor are produced in many organs and tissues, including the small intestine, certain regions of the brain, and several hormone-producing (endocrine) tissues.Prokineticin 2 and its receptor play a role in the development of a group of nerve cells that are specialized to process smells (olfactory neurons).

These proteins help stimulate the movement of food through the intestine and are likely involved in the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). They also play a role in coordinating daily (circadian) rhythms, such as the sleep-wake cycle and regular changes in body temperature. Prokineticin 2 and its receptor are active in a region of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which acts as an internal clock that controls circadian rhythms.","Kallmann syndrome At least 30 mutations in the PROKR2 gene can cause Kallmann syndrome, a disorder characterized by the combination of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (a condition affecting the production of hormones that direct sexual development) and an impaired sense of smell. Researchers estimate that mutations in the PROKR2 and PROK2 genes together account for about 9 percent of all cases of Kallmann syndrome.Most of the PROKR2 gene mutations that cause Kallmann syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in prokineticin receptor 2. These mutations disrupt the function of the receptor, affecting its ability to trigger chemical signals within cells. A loss of this signaling disrupts the migration and survival of olfactory neurons and GnRH-producing neurons in the developing brain. If olfactory nerve cells do not extend to the olfactory bulb, a person's sense of smell will be impaired or absent. Misplacement or premature loss of GnRH-producing neurons prevents the production of sex hormones, which interferes with normal sexual development and causes puberty to be delayed or absent.Because the features and severity of Kallmann syndrome vary among individuals, researchers believe that additional genetic and environmental factors may be involved. Some affected individuals have mutations in one of several other genes in addition to PROKR2, and these genetic changes may contribute to the varied features of the condition. "
1070,PROP1 ,PROP paired-like homeobox 1,"The PROP1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control the activity of many other genes. On the basis of this action, the PROP1 protein is known as a transcription factor. This protein is found only in the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain. The pituitary gland releases hormones needed for growth, reproduction, and other critical body functions. The PROP1 protein helps in the specialization (differentiation) of cell types within the pituitary gland.","Combined pituitary hormone deficiency At least 25 mutations in the PROP1 gene have been found to cause combined pituitary hormone deficiency. The most common mutation deletes two DNA building blocks in the PROP1 gene (written as 301-302delAG). This deletion leads to the production of an abnormally short protein that cannot function properly. The shortened protein is less able to control the activity of other genes, which reduces pituitary cell differentiation and prevents the release of hormones from the pituitary gland. A lack of these hormones can cause short stature, delayed or absent puberty, and other signs and symptoms of combined pituitary hormone deficiency. "
1071,PROS1 ,protein S,"The PROS1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called protein S that is important for controlling blood clotting. By itself, protein S cannot carry out the chemical reactions necessary for regulating the formation of blood clots. Instead, protein S attaches to certain enzymes and enhances their function. On the basis of this action, protein S is called a cofactor.Protein S is made chiefly by cells in the liver. The protein circulates in the bloodstream in two forms; it is either attached (bound) to a specific protein or occurs by itself in a free form. Both forms of proteins S can act as cofactors; however, bound protein S is less effective than the free form. Protein S is a cofactor for an enzyme called activated protein C (APC). APC turns off (inactivates) the blood clotting proteins known as factor Va and factor VIIIa. Protein S also helps an enzyme known as tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) block the activity of another clotting protein, factor Xa.","Protein S deficiency More than 220 mutations in the PROS1 gene have been found to cause protein S deficiency. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in protein S, which disrupts its ability to act as a cofactor. Protein S deficiency can be divided into three types based on the mutation in the PROS1 gene.Protein S deficiency type I is caused by PROS1 gene mutations that result in reduced levels of protein S. Affected individuals do not have enough protein S to control blood clotting, which causes the increased risk for abnormal blood clots in protein S deficiency.Mutations that cause protein S deficiency type II result in the production of an altered protein S with reduced activity. Individuals with this form of the condition have normal levels of protein S, but the protein is not able to interact with other molecules involved in blood clotting. If protein S does not function properly, abnormal blood clots may form.Protein S deficiency type III occurs when there is a low amount of free protein S, but the overall amount of protein S is normal. Because free protein S is a more effective cofactor than bound protein S, reduced levels of free protein S can disrupt the inactivation of blood clotting proteins. "
1072,PRPH2 ,peripherin 2,"The PRPH2 gene (also known as RDS) provides instructions for making a protein called peripherin 2. This protein plays an important role in normal vision. Peripherin 2 is found in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. This protein is essential for the normal function of specialized cells called photoreceptors that detect light and color. Within these cells, peripherin 2 is involved in the formation and stability of structures that contain light-sensing pigments.","Vitelliform macular dystrophy Mutations in the PRPH2 gene are responsible for some cases of adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy. Several mutations have been identified in people with this disorder, most of which change a single protein building block (amino acid) in peripherin 2. These mutations alter the protein's structure or lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the protein. When peripherin 2 is altered or missing, photoreceptors break down (degenerate) over time. This loss of photoreceptors underlies the retinal abnormalities and progressive vision loss characteristic of vitelliform macular dystrophy. It is unclear why PRPH2 mutations affect only central vision in people with this disorder. "
1073,PRPS1 ,phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1,"The PRPS1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1, or PRPP synthetase 1. This enzyme helps produce a molecule called phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP). PRPP is involved in making purine and pyrimidine nucleotides. These nucleotides are building blocks of DNA, its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as ATP and GTP that serve as energy sources in the cell.Purines and pyrimidines may be manufactured from smaller molecules, or they can be recycled from the breakdown of DNA and RNA in a series of reactions called the salvage pathway. Manufacturing purines and pyrimidines uses much more energy and takes more time than recycling them, which makes recycling these molecules more efficient. The salvage pathway ensures that cells have a plentiful supply of purines and pyrimidines.PRPP synthetase 1 and PRPP are involved in the manufacture of new purines and pyrimidines, and are also essential for the purine salvage pathway.","Arts syndrome At least three PRPS1 gene mutations have been identified in people with Arts syndrome, a disorder that causes serious neurological problems in males. Females can also be affected by this condition, but they typically have much milder symptoms.The PRPS1 gene mutations that cause Arts syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the PRPP synthetase 1 enzyme. The mutations are believed to result in the production of an unstable enzyme with little or no activity. The lack of functional PRPP synthetase 1 enzyme disrupts both the manufacture and recycling of purines. The manufacture of pyrimidines is also affected, but not the pyrimidine salvage pathway. The disruption of purine production, and to a lesser extent pyrimidine production, may impair energy storage and transport in cells. Impairment of these processes may have a particularly severe effect on tissues that require a large amount of energy, such as the nervous system, resulting in the neurological problems characteristic of Arts syndrome. "
1074,PRRT2 ,proline rich transmembrane protein 2,"The PRRT2 gene provides instructions for making the proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2). The function of this protein is unknown, although it is thought to be involved in signaling in the brain. Studies show that it interacts with another protein called SNAP25, which is involved in signaling between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. SNAP25 helps control the release of neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that relay signals from one neuron to another.","Familial hemiplegic migraine At least two mutations in the PRRT2 gene have been identified in people with familial hemiplegic migraine. This condition is characterized by migraine headaches with a pattern of neurological symptoms known as aura. In familial hemiplegic migraine, the aura includes temporary numbness or weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis).One PRRT2 gene mutation that is found in multiple people with familial hemiplegic migraine inserts an extra DNA building block (nucleotide) in the gene. (This change is written as 649dupC.) Both known mutations alter the blueprint used for making the protein and lead to production of an abnormally short PRRT2 protein that is quickly broken down. As a result, affected individuals have a shortage of PRRT2 protein. Researchers speculate that this shortage affects the function of the SNAP25 protein, leading to abnormal signaling between neurons, although the mechanism that causes familial hemiplegic migraine is unknown. It is thought that the changes in signaling in the brain lead to development of the severe headaches characteristic of the disorder. "
1075,PRSS1 ,serine protease 1,"The PRSS1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called cationic trypsinogen. This enzyme is a serine peptidase, which is a type of enzyme that cuts (cleaves) other proteins into smaller pieces. Cationic trypsinogen is produced in the pancreas and helps with the digestion of food. Cationic trypsinogen is secreted by the pancreas and transported to the small intestine, where it is cleaved to form trypsinogen. When the enzyme is needed, trypsinogen is cleaved again into its working (active) form called trypsin. Trypsin aids in digestion by cutting protein chains at the protein building blocks (amino acids) arginine or lysine, which breaks down the protein. Trypsin also turns on (activates) other digestive enzymes that are produced in the pancreas to further facilitate digestion.A particular region of trypsin is attached (bound) to a calcium molecule. As long as trypsin is bound to calcium, the enzyme is protected from being broken down. When digestion is complete and trypsin is no longer needed, the calcium molecule is removed from the enzyme, which allows trypsin to be broken down.","Hereditary pancreatitis More than 40 mutations in the PRSS1 gene have been found to cause hereditary pancreatitis, a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), which can lead to a loss of pancreatic function. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in cationic trypsinogen. Some PRSS1 gene mutations result in the production of a cationic trypsinogen enzyme that is prematurely converted to trypsin while it is still in the pancreas. Other mutations prevent trypsin from being broken down. The most common PRSS1 gene mutation that causes hereditary pancreatitis replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid histidine at position 122 in the enzyme (written Arg122His or R122H). As a result of this mutation, the enzyme is not able to be broken down, even when it is no longer bound to calcium.Trypsin activity in the pancreas can damage pancreatic tissue and can also trigger an immune response, causing inflammation in the pancreas and leading to episodes of pancreatitis. "
1076,PSAP ,prosaposin,"The PSAP gene provides instructions for making a protein called prosaposin. This protein is involved in a number of biological functions, including the development of the nervous system and the reproductive system. Prosaposin is the precursor of four smaller proteins called saposin A, B, C, and D, which are produced when prosaposin is broken up (cleaved).The individual saposins are found in cellular structures called lysosomes, which are the cell's recycling centers. The saposins help lysosomal enzymes break down fatty substances called sphingolipids.The saposin B protein works with several enzymes to break down sphingolipids. Its most critical biological role seems to be associated with the enzyme arylsulfatase A. This enzyme is involved in breaking down a subgroup of sphingolipids called sulfatides, especially in the nervous system's white matter, which consists of nerve fibers covered by myelin. Myelin is a substance that insulates and protects nerves. Saposin B may also play a role in transporting lipids to the outer surface of the cell so they can be recognized by the immune system.The saposin C protein works with the enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase to break down another sphingolipid called glucocerebroside. Saposins A and D are also involved in processing sphingolipids.","Metachromatic leukodystrophy In a small number of individuals with metachromatic leukodystrophy, a disorder that causes deterioration of nervous system functions, researchers have identified PSAP gene mutations that result in a shortage (deficiency) of the saposin B protein. This deficiency interferes with the breakdown of sulfatides. As a result, these substances can accumulate to toxic levels in the nervous system.The buildup of sulfatides gradually destroys myelin, the covering that protects nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. Destruction of myelin leads to a loss of white matter (leukodystrophy) and impairment of nervous system function, resulting in the signs and symptoms of metachromatic leukodystrophy. "
1077,PSEN1 ,presenilin 1,"The PSEN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called presenilin 1. This protein is one part (subunit) of a complex called gamma- (γ-) secretase. Presenilin 1 carries out the major function of the complex, which is to cut apart (cleave) other proteins into smaller pieces called peptides. This process is called proteolysis, and presenilin 1 is described as the proteolytic subunit of γ-secretase.The γ-secretase complex is located in the membrane that surrounds cells, where it cleaves many different proteins that span the cell membrane (transmembrane proteins). This cleavage is an important step in several chemical signaling pathways that transmit signals from outside the cell into the nucleus. One of these pathways, known as Notch signaling, is essential for the normal maturation and division of hair follicle cells and other types of skin cells. Notch signaling is also involved in normal immune system function.The γ-secretase complex may be best known for its role in processing amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is made in the brain and other tissues. γ-secretase cuts APP into smaller peptides, including soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) and several versions of amyloid-beta (β) peptide. Evidence suggests that sAPP has growth-promoting properties and may play a role in the formation of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain both before and after birth. Other functions of sAPP and amyloid-β peptide are under investigation.","Alzheimer disease More than 150 PSEN1 gene mutations have been identified in patients with early-onset Alzheimer disease, a degenerative brain condition that begins before age 65. Mutations in the PSEN1 gene are the most common cause of early-onset Alzheimer disease, accounting for up to 70 percent of cases.Almost all PSEN1 gene mutations change single building blocks of DNA (nucleotides) in a particular segment of the PSEN1 gene. These mutations result in the production of an abnormal presenilin 1 protein. Defective presenilin 1 interferes with the function of the γ-secretase complex, which alters the processing of APP and leads to the overproduction of a longer, toxic version of amyloid-β peptide. Copies of this protein fragment stick together and build up in the brain, forming clumps called amyloid plaques that are a characteristic feature of Alzheimer disease. A buildup of toxic amyloid-β peptide and the formation of amyloid plaques likely lead to the death of neurons and the progressive signs and symptoms of this disorder. "
1078,PSEN2 ,presenilin 2,"The PSEN2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called presenilin 2. Presenilin 2 helps process proteins that transmit chemical signals from the cell membrane into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, these signals turn on (activate) genes that are important for cell growth and maturation.Presenilin 2 is best known for its role in processing amyloid precursor protein, which is found in the brain and other tissues. Research suggests that presenilin 2 works together with other enzymes to cut amyloid precursor protein into smaller segments (peptides). One of these peptides is called soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP), and another is called amyloid beta peptide. Recent evidence suggests that sAPP has growth-promoting properties and may play a role in the formation of neurons in the brain both before and after birth. Other functions of sAPP and amyloid beta peptide are under investigation.","Alzheimer disease At least 11 mutations in the PSEN2 gene have been shown to cause early-onset Alzheimer disease. Mutations in this gene account for less than 5 percent of all early-onset cases of the disorder.Two of the most common PSEN2 mutations that cause early-onset Alzheimer disease change single protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make presenilin 2. One mutation replaces the amino acid asparagine with the amino acid isoleucine at position 141 (written as Asn141Ile or N141I). The other mutation changes the amino acid methionine to the amino acid valine at position 239 (written as Met239Val or M239V). These mutations appear to disrupt the processing of amyloid precursor protein, leading to the overproduction of amyloid beta peptide. This protein fragment can build up in the brain and form clumps called amyloid plaques that are characteristic of Alzheimer disease. A buildup of toxic amyloid beta peptide and amyloid plaques may lead to the death of neurons and the progressive signs and symptoms of this disorder. "
1079,PSENEN ,"presenilin enhancer, gamma-secretase subunit","The PSENEN gene provides instructions for making a protein called presenilin enhancer 2 or PEN-2. This protein is one part (subunit) of a complex called gamma- (γ-) secretase. PEN-2 processes another subunit of the complex, presenilin 1, which is produced from the PSEN1 gene. This step is necessary for the γ-secretase complex to be functional.The γ-secretase complex is located in the membrane that surrounds cells, where it cuts apart (cleaves) many different proteins that span the cell membrane (transmembrane proteins). This cleavage is an important step in several chemical signaling pathways that transmit signals from outside the cell into the nucleus. One of these pathways, known as Notch signaling, is essential for the normal maturation and division of hair follicle cells and other types of skin cells. Notch signaling is also involved in normal immune system function.","Hidradenitis suppurativa At least three mutations in the PSENEN gene have been found to cause hidradenitis suppurativa, a chronic skin disease characterized by recurrent boil-like lumps (nodules) under the skin that develop in hair follicles. The nodules tend to become inflamed and painful, and they produce significant scarring as they heal.PSENEN gene mutations reduce the amount of functional PEN-2 produced in cells, so less of this protein is available to act as part of the γ-secretase complex. The resulting shortage of normal γ-secretase impairs cell signaling pathways, including Notch signaling. Although little is known about the mechanism, studies suggest that abnormal Notch signaling may promote the development of recurrent nodules in hair follicles and trigger inflammation in the skin. "
1080,PSMB8 ,proteasome subunit beta 8,"The PSMB8 gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of cell structures called immunoproteasomes. Immunoproteasomes are specialized versions of proteasomes, which are large complexes that recognize and break down (degrade) unneeded, excess, or abnormal proteins within cells. This activity is necessary for many essential cell functions. While proteasomes are found in many types of cells, immunoproteasomes are located primarily in immune system cells. These structures play an important role in regulating the immune system's response to foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria. One of the primary functions of immunoproteasomes is to help the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders, so the immune system can respond appropriately to infection.Immunoproteasomes may also have other functions in immune system cells and possibly in other types of cells. They appear to be involved in some of the same fundamental cell activities as regular proteasomes, such as regulating the amount of various proteins in cells (protein homeostasis), cell growth and division, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), chemical signaling within cells, and the activity of genes. Studies suggest that, through unknown mechanisms, the subunit produced from the PSMB8 gene in particular may be involved in the maturation of fat cells (adipocytes).","Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome At least one mutation in the PSMB8 gene has been found to cause Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome, a condition that has been described only in the Japanese population. The identified mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the protein produced from the PSMB8 gene, replacing the amino acid glycine with the amino acid valine at protein position 201 (written as Gly201Val or G201V). This mutation greatly reduces the production of this protein, which impairs the normal assembly of immunoproteasomes and causes the immune system to malfunction. For unknown reasons, the malfunctioning immune system triggers abnormal inflammation that can damage tissues throughout the body.Abnormal inflammation likely underlies many of the signs and symptoms of Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome, including the development of red, swollen lumps (nodular erythema) on the skin, recurrent fevers, joint problems, and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). It is less clear how mutations in the PSMB8 gene lead to other characteristic features of the condition, including muscle weakness and wasting and a loss of fatty tissue (lipodystrophy), mainly in the upper body. Because the protein produced from the PSMB8 gene may be involved in the maturation of adipocytes, studies suggest that a shortage of this protein may interfere with the normal development and function of these cells. "
1081,PTCH1 ,patched 1,"The PTCH1 gene provides instructions for producing the patched-1 protein, which functions as a receptor. Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. A protein called Sonic Hedgehog is the ligand for the patched-1 receptor. Together, ligands and their receptors trigger signals that affect cell development and function.Patched-1 and Sonic Hedgehog function in a pathway that is essential for early development. This pathway plays a role in cell growth, cell specialization, and determining the shape (patterning) of many different parts of the developing body. When Sonic Hedgehog is not present, patched-1 prevents cells from growing and dividing (proliferating). When Sonic Hedgehog is attached, patched-1 stops suppressing cell proliferation. Based on its role in preventing cells from proliferating in an uncontrolled way, PTCH1 is called a tumor suppressor gene.","Gorlin syndrome More than 225 mutations in the PTCH1 gene have been found to cause Gorlin syndrome (also known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome), a condition that affects many areas of the body and increases the risk of developing various cancerous and noncancerous tumors. Mutations in this gene prevent the production of patched-1 or lead to the production of an abnormal version of the receptor. An altered or missing patched-1 receptor cannot effectively suppress cell growth and division. As a result, cells proliferate uncontrollably to form the tumors that are characteristic of Gorlin syndrome. It is less clear how PTCH1 gene mutations cause the other signs and symptoms related to this condition, including small depressions (pits) in the skin of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, an unusually large head size (macrocephaly), and skeletal abnormalities. "
1082,PTEN ,phosphatase and tensin homolog,"The PTEN gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found in almost all tissues in the body. The enzyme acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it helps regulate cell division by keeping cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. The PTEN enzyme modifies other proteins and fats (lipids) by removing phosphate groups, each of which consists of three oxygen atoms and one phosphorus atom. Enzymes with this function are called phosphatases.The PTEN enzyme is part of a chemical pathway that signals cells to stop dividing and triggers cells to self-destruct through a process called apoptosis. Evidence suggests that this enzyme also helps control cell movement (migration), the sticking (adhesion) of cells to surrounding tissues, and the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). Additionally, it likely plays a role in maintaining the stability of a cell's genetic information. All of these functions help prevent uncontrolled cell growth that can lead to the formation of tumors.","Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome More than 30 mutations in the PTEN gene have been found to cause Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome. Common features of this condition include a large head size (macrocephaly), multiple noncancerous tumors and tumor-like growths called hamartomas, and dark freckles on the penis in males. Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome is one of several related conditions that are often considered together as PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (described below).Some of the mutations that cause Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome change single DNA building blocks (base pairs) in the PTEN gene or insert or delete a small number of base pairs. Other mutations result in an abnormally short enzyme or reduce the amount of enzyme that is produced. In about 10 percent of cases, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome results from the deletion of a large amount of genetic material that includes part or all of the PTEN gene. All of these genetic changes prevent the PTEN enzyme from regulating cell proliferation effectively, which can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and the formation of hamartomas and other types of tumors. It is unclear how PTEN gene mutations cause macrocephaly and the other features of Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome. "
1083,PTPN11 ,"protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 11","The PTPN11 gene provides instructions for making a protein called SHP-2. This protein helps regulate the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. This pathway is involved in several important cell functions, including the growth and division of cells (proliferation), the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (migration), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). During embryonic development, the SHP-2 protein is critical in the development of the heart, blood cells, bones, and several other tissues.The PTPN11 gene belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous.","Noonan syndrome More than 90 mutations causing Noonan syndrome have been identified in the PTPN11 gene. This condition is characterized by mildly unusual facial characteristics, short stature, heart defects, bleeding problems, skeletal malformations, and many other signs and symptoms. Most of the PTPN11 gene mutations replace single amino acids used to make the SHP-2 protein. The resulting protein is either continuously turned on (active) or has prolonged activation, rather than promptly switching on and off in response to other cellular proteins. This increase in protein activity disrupts the regulation of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway that controls cell functions such as proliferation. This misregulation can result in the heart defects, growth problems, skeletal abnormalities, and other features of Noonan syndrome.Rarely, a person with Noonan syndrome caused by PTPN11 gene mutations will also develop juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, which is a type of blood cancer that typically affects children or adolescents. "
1084,PTPN22 ,"protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22","The PTPN22 gene provides instructions for making a protein that belongs to the PTP (protein tyrosine phosphatases) family. PTP proteins play a role in regulating a process called signal transduction. In signal transduction, the protein relays signals from outside the cell to the cell nucleus. These signals instruct the cell to grow and divide or to mature and take on specialized functions.The PTPN22 protein is involved in signaling that helps control the activity of immune system cells called T cells. T cells identify foreign substances and defend the body against infection.","Vitiligo Studies have associated the R620W variation in the PTPN22 gene with an increased risk of vitiligo, an autoimmune condition that results in patchy changes in skin coloring (pigmentation).As with other autoimmune disorders, this variation likely affects the activity of the PTPN22 protein, making it more difficult for the body to control the immune system and prevent it from attacking its own tissues. While the pigment loss associated with vitiligo results from the immune system attacking pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) in the skin, it is unclear what specific circumstances trigger the immune system to do so. The condition probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, most of which have not been identified. "
1085,PTS ,6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase,"The PTS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase. This enzyme is involved in the second of three steps in the production of a molecule called tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Other enzymes help carry out the first and third steps in this process.Tetrahydrobiopterin plays a critical role in processing several protein building blocks (amino acids) in the body. For example, it works with the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase to convert an amino acid called phenylalanine into another amino acid, tyrosine. Tetrahydrobiopterin is also involved in reactions that produce chemicals called neurotransmitters, which transmit signals between nerve cells in the brain. Because it helps enzymes carry out chemical reactions, tetrahydrobiopterin is known as a cofactor.","Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency More than 45 mutations in the PTS gene have been found to cause tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency. When this condition is caused by PTS gene mutations, it is known as 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTS) deficiency. PTS deficiency accounts for more than half of all cases of tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency.Most PTS gene mutations change single amino acids in 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase, although some mutations insert or delete small amounts of DNA in the PTS gene or disrupt the way the gene's instructions are used to make the enzyme. Changes in 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase greatly reduce or eliminate the enzyme's activity. Without enough of this enzyme, little or no tetrahydrobiopterin is produced. As a result, this cofactor is not available to participate in chemical reactions such as the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. If phenylalanine is not converted to tyrosine, it can build up to toxic levels in the blood and other tissues. Nerve cells in the brain are particularly sensitive to phenylalanine levels, which is why excessive amounts of this substance can cause brain damage.Additionally, a reduction in 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase activity disrupts the production of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. Because neurotransmitters are necessary for normal brain function, changes in the levels of these chemicals contribute to intellectual disability in people with PTS deficiency. "
1086,PURA ,purine rich element binding protein A,"The PURA gene provides instructions for making a protein called Pur-alpha (Purα), which is able to attach (bind) to DNA and RNA (a molecular cousin of DNA). This protein has multiple roles in cells, including controlling the activity of genes (gene transcription) and aiding in the copying (replication) of DNA.The Purα protein is important for normal brain development. The protein helps direct the growth and division of nerve cells (neurons). It may also be involved in the formation or maturation of myelin, the protective substance that covers nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses.","5q31.3 microdeletion syndrome 5q31.3 microdeletion syndrome is caused by a chromosomal change in which a small piece of chromosome 5 is deleted in each cell. This rare condition is characterized by severely delayed or impaired development of speech and walking, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), breathing problems, recurrent seizures (epilepsy) or seizure-like episodes, and distinctive facial features. The deletion that causes this condition occurs on the long (q) arm of the chromosome at a position designated q31.3. The size of the deletion can range from several thousand to several million DNA building blocks (base pairs). The deleted region typically contains at least three genes, one of which is PURA.A loss of one copy of the PURA gene is thought to alter normal brain development and impair the function of neurons, leading to developmental delay, hypotonia, and other neurological problems in people with 5q31.3 microdeletion syndrome. Some studies suggest that loss of another nearby gene called NRG2 increases the severity of the signs and symptoms. It is unclear how the loss of other genes in the deleted region contributes to development of 5q31.3 microdeletion syndrome. "
1087,PYGL ,glycogen phosphorylase L,"The PYGL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called liver glycogen phosphorylase. This enzyme breaks down a complex sugar called glycogen. Liver glycogen phosphorylase is one of three related enzymes that break down glycogen in cells; the other glycogen phosphorylases are found in the brain and in muscles. Liver glycogen phosphorylase is found only in liver cells, where it breaks down glycogen into a type of sugar called glucose-1-phosphate. Additional steps convert glucose-1-phosphate into glucose, a simple sugar that is the main energy source for most cells in the body.","Glycogen storage disease type VI At least 17 mutations in the PYGL gene have been found to cause glycogen storage disease type VI (GSDVI). Most mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in liver glycogen phosphorylase, affecting the normal function of the enzyme. In the Old Order Mennonite population, a common mutation (written as 1620+1G>A) disrupts the way the PYGL gene's instructions are used to make the enzyme. A defective liver glycogen phosphorylase enzyme impairs the normal breakdown of glycogen. As a result, liver cells cannot use glycogen for energy, so liver function becomes impaired. A lack of glycogen breakdown within liver cells leads to the major features of GSDVI. "
1088,PYGM ,"glycogen phosphorylase, muscle associated","The PYGM gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called myophosphorylase. This enzyme breaks down a complex sugar called glycogen. Myophosphorylase is one of three related enzymes called glycogen phosphorylases that break down glycogen in cells. Myophosphorylase is found only in muscle cells, where it breaks down glycogen into a simpler sugar called glucose-1-phosphate. Additional steps convert glucose-1-phosphate into glucose, a simple sugar that is the main energy source for most cells.","Glycogen storage disease type V Approximately 130 mutations in the PYGM gene have been found to cause glycogen storage disease type V (GSDV). One mutation that is common in North American and European populations is written as Arg50Ter or R50X. This mutation creates a premature stop signal in the instructions for making myophosphorylase, which decreases the production of the enzyme. A shortage of myophosphorylase impairs the normal breakdown of glycogen. Other mutations that cause GSDV may severely reduce enzyme activity or change the way the enzyme folds into a 3-dimensional shape. The defective enzyme is unable to break down glycogen. As a result, muscle cells cannot produce enough energy, so muscles become easily fatigued. Reduced energy production in muscle cells leads to the major features of GSDV. "
1089,QDPR ,quinoid dihydropteridine reductase,"The QDPR gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called quinoid dihydropteridine reductase. This enzyme helps carry out one step in the chemical pathway that recycles a molecule called tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4).Tetrahydrobiopterin plays a critical role in processing several protein building blocks (amino acids) in the body. For example, it works with the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase to convert an amino acid called phenylalanine into another amino acid, tyrosine. Tetrahydrobiopterin is also involved in reactions that produce chemicals called neurotransmitters, which transmit signals between nerve cells in the brain. Because it helps enzymes carry out chemical reactions, tetrahydrobiopterin is known as a cofactor.When tetrahydrobiopterin interacts with enzymes during chemical reactions, the cofactor is altered and must be recycled to a usable form. Quinoid dihydropteridine reductase is one of two enzymes that help recycle tetrahydrobiopterin in the body.","Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency More than 30 mutations in the QDPR gene have been found to cause tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency. When this condition results from QDPR gene mutations, it is known as dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) deficiency. DHPR deficiency accounts for about one-third of all cases of tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency.Most QDPR gene mutations change single amino acids in quinoid dihydropteridine reductase, although some mutations insert small amounts of DNA into the QDPR gene or disrupt the way the gene's instructions are used to make the enzyme. Changes in quinoid dihydropteridine reductase greatly reduce or eliminate the enzyme's activity. Without enough of this enzyme, tetrahydrobiopterin is not recycled properly. As a result, this cofactor is not available to participate in chemical reactions such as the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. If phenylalanine is not converted to tyrosine, it can build up to toxic levels in the blood and other tissues. Nerve cells in the brain are particularly sensitive to phenylalanine levels, which is why excessive amounts of this substance can cause brain damage.Additionally, a reduction in quinoid dihydropteridine reductase activity disrupts the production of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. Because neurotransmitters are necessary for normal brain function, changes in the levels of these brain chemicals contribute to intellectual disability in people with DHPR deficiency. "
1090,RAB3GAP1 ,RAB3 GTPase activating protein catalytic subunit 1,"The RAB3GAP1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps regulate the activity of specialized proteins called GTPases, which control a variety of functions in cells. To perform its function, the RAB3GAP1 protein interacts with another protein called RAB3GAP2 (produced from the RAB3GAP2 gene) to form the RAB3GAP complex.Often referred to as molecular switches, GTPases can be turned on and off. They are turned on (active) when they are attached (bound) to a molecule called GTP and are turned off (inactive) when they are bound to another molecule called GDP. The RAB3GAP complex turns on a GTPase known as RAB18 by exchanging GTP for the attached GDP. When active, RAB18 is involved in a process called vesicle trafficking, which moves proteins and other molecules within cells in sac-like structures called vesicles. RAB18 regulates the movement of substances between compartments in cells and the storage and release of fats (lipids) by structures called lipid droplets. The protein also appears to play a role in a process called autophagy, which helps clear unneeded materials from cells. RAB18 is important for the organization of a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein processing and transport.The RAB3GAP complex is also thought to inactivate another GTPase known as RAB3 by stimulating a reaction that turns the attached GTP into GDP. RAB3 plays a role in the release of hormones and brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) from cells.","RAB18 deficiency More than 60 RAB3GAP1 gene mutations have been found to cause RAB18 deficiency, resulting in conditions that affect the eyes, brain, and reproductive system. The two conditions caused by this deficiency are Warburg micro syndrome at the severe end of the spectrum and Martsolf syndrome at the mild end. RAB3GAP1 gene mutations are the most common cause of Warburg micro syndrome and are rare in Martsolf syndrome.Warburg micro syndrome is caused by RAB3GAP1 gene mutations that prevent the production of any RAB3GAP1 protein or completely eliminate its function. Martsolf syndrome occurs when a small amount of functional RAB3GAP1 protein is produced from the mutated gene. Reduction or loss of this protein likely impairs the formation or function of the RAB3GAP complex, leading to a shortage (deficiency) of RAB18 activity. It is unclear why the loss of RAB18 function leads to eye problems, brain abnormalities, and other features of these two conditions.Because Warburg micro syndrome and Martsolf syndrome can be caused by mutations in other genes that disrupt normal RAB18 activity, loss of control of this GTPase is thought to underlie the conditions. It is unclear if impaired regulation of RAB3 activity contributes to the features of Warburg micro syndrome or Martsolf syndrome. "
1091,RAB3GAP2 ,RAB3 GTPase activating non-catalytic protein subunit 2,"The RAB3GAP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps regulate the activity of specialized proteins called GTPases, which control a variety of functions in cells. To perform its function, the RAB3GAP2 protein interacts with another protein called RAB3GAP1 (produced from the RAB3GAP1 gene) to form the RAB3GAP complex.Often referred to as molecular switches, GTPases can be turned on and off.

The two conditions caused by this deficiency are Warburg micro syndrome at the severe end of the spectrum and Martsolf syndrome at the mild end. RAB3GAP2 gene mutations are the most common cause of Martsolf syndrome and can also cause Warburg micro syndrome.Martsolf syndrome is caused by RAB3GAP2 gene mutations that reduce the amount of functional RAB3GAP2 protein. Warburg micro syndrome occurs when the gene mutations prevent the production of any RAB3GAP2 protein or completely eliminate its function. Reduction or loss of this protein likely impairs the formation or function of the RAB3GAP complex, leading to a shortage (deficiency) of RAB18 activity.

It is unclear if impaired regulation of RAB3 activity contributes to the features of Warburg micro syndrome or Martsolf syndrome. "
1092,RAB18 ,"RAB18, member RAS oncogene family","The RAB18 gene provides instructions for producing the RAB18 protein, which functions as a GTPase. Often referred to as molecular switches, GTPases can be turned on and off.

Warburg micro syndrome is characterized by multiple eye abnormalities, vision impairment, severe intellectual disability, and a reduction of the hormones that direct sexual development (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism).The RAB18 gene mutations that cause Warburg micro syndrome eliminate the function of the RAB18 protein. It is unclear how a shortage (deficiency) of RAB18 activity leads to eye problems, brain abnormalities, and other features of Warburg micro syndrome. "
1093,RAB23 ,"RAB23, member RAS oncogene family","The RAB23 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in a process called vesicle trafficking, which moves proteins and other molecules within cells in sac-like structures called vesicles. A vesicle forms when the cell membrane folds around a substance outside the cell (such as a protein). The vesicle is drawn into the cell, pinched off from the cell membrane (a process called endocytosis), and attached to the Rab23 protein. Once inside the cell, the vesicle is guided by the Rab23 protein to its proper destination. Vesicle trafficking is important for the transport of materials that are needed to trigger signaling during development.Through the transport of certain proteins, the Rab23 protein regulates a specific developmental pathway called the hedgehog signaling pathway that is critical in cell growth (proliferation), cell specialization, and the normal shaping (patterning) of many parts of the body during embryonic development.","Carpenter syndrome More than a dozen mutations in the RAB23 gene have been found to cause Carpenter syndrome, a condition characterized by irregular skull formation, finger and toe abnormalities, and many other features. One mutation that is frequently seen in individuals with Carpenter syndrome who are of northern European ancestry replaces the protein building block (amino acid) leucine with a premature stop signal at protein position 145 (written as Leu145Term or L145X). This mutation results in an abnormally short, unstable protein that is quickly broken down. Other RAB23 gene mutations that cause Carpenter syndrome reduce or eliminate function of the Rab23 protein. It is not clear how these mutations result in the specific features of Carpenter syndrome; however, it is likely that impaired transport of proteins involved in the hedgehog signaling pathway contributes to the development of this disorder. "
1094,RAB27A ,"RAB27A, member RAS oncogene family","The RAB27A gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in a process called vesicle trafficking, which moves proteins and other molecules within cells in sac-like structures called vesicles. Although the Rab27a protein is found in cells and tissues throughout the body, it appears to be most critical in pigment-producing cells called melanocytes and in certain immune system cells.In melanocytes, the Rab27a protein helps transport structures called melanosomes. These structures produce a pigment called melanin, which is the substance that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color (pigmentation). Rab27a interacts with proteins produced from the MLPH and MYO5A genes to form a complex that transports melanosomes to the outer edges of melanocytes. From there, the melanosomes are transferred to other types of cells, where they provide the pigment needed for normal hair, skin, and eye coloring.The Rab27a protein also plays an important role in immune system cells called T-lymphocytes. These cells recognize and attack foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, to prevent infection and illness. Specifically, Rab27a is involved in cytotoxic granule exostosis, which is the process by which T-lymphocytes release cell-killing (cytotoxic) compounds to destroy foreign invaders.","Griscelli syndrome At least 24 mutations in the RAB27A gene have been found in people with Griscelli syndrome. These mutations cause a form of the condition designated type 2, which is characterized by unusually light (hypopigmented) skin, silvery-gray hair, and immune system abnormalities. The known mutations either prevent the production of any Rab27a protein or lead to the production of an abnormal or unstable protein that cannot form a complex with the proteins produced from the MLPH and MYO5A genes. A shortage of functional Rab27a protein impairs the normal transport of melanosomes to the edges of melanocytes. Instead, these structures clump near the center of melanocytes, trapping melanin within these cells and preventing normal pigmentation of skin and hair. A loss of Rab27a function in T-lymphocytes impairs cytotoxic granule exocytosis, making people with Griscelli syndrome type 2 prone to recurrent infections.Through mechanisms that are not well understood, a shortage of Rab27a in immune system cells also leads to a condition called hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) in people with Griscelli syndrome type 2. This condition triggers the immune system to produce too many activated T-lymphocytes and other immune cells called macrophages (histiocytes). Overactivity of these cells can damage organs and tissues throughout the body, causing life-threatening complications if the condition is untreated. "
1095,RAD21 ,RAD21 cohesin complex component,"The RAD21 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in regulating the structure and organization of chromosomes during cell division.Before cells divide, they must copy all of their chromosomes. The copied DNA from each chromosome is arranged into two identical structures, called sister chromatids, which are attached to one another during the early stages of cell division. The RAD21 protein is part of a protein group called the cohesin complex that holds the sister chromatids together.Researchers believe that the RAD21 protein, as a structural component of the cohesin complex, also plays important roles in stabilizing cells' genetic information, repairing damaged DNA, and regulating the activity of certain genes that are essential for normal development.","Cornelia de Lange syndrome At least eight mutations in the RAD21 gene have been identified in people with Cornelia de Lange syndrome, a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body. Mutations in this gene appear to be an uncommon cause of this condition.Some cases of Cornelia de Lange syndrome have resulted from a deletion that removes a segment of DNA on chromosome 8 including the RAD21 gene. In these cases, the entire gene is missing from one copy of the chromosome in each cell, so cells produce a reduced amount of RAD21 protein. In other cases, the condition is caused by mutations within the RAD21 gene that impair or eliminate the function of the RAD21 protein. A defective or missing RAD21 protein likely alters the activity of the cohesin complex, impairing its ability to regulate genes that are critical for normal development. Although researchers do not fully understand how these changes cause Cornelia de Lange syndrome, they suspect that altered gene regulation probably underlies many of the developmental problems characteristic of the condition.Studies suggest that mutations in the RAD21 gene cause a form of Cornelia de Lange syndrome with relatively mild features. Compared to mutations in the NIPBL gene, which are the most common known cause of the disorder, RAD21 gene mutations cause less significant delays in development and growth and are less likely to cause major birth defects.

1096,RAD51 ,RAD51 recombinase,"The RAD51 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is essential for repairing damaged DNA. Breaks in DNA can be caused by natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, and also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material in preparation for cell division. The RAD51 protein binds to the DNA at the site of a break and encases it in a protein sheath, which is an essential first step in the repair process.In the nucleus of many types of normal cells, the RAD51 protein interacts with many other proteins, including BRCA1 and BRCA2, to fix damaged DNA. The BRCA2 protein regulates the activity of the RAD51 protein by transporting it to sites of DNA damage in the nucleus. The interaction between the BRCA1 protein and the RAD51 protein is less clear, although research suggests that BRCA1 may also activate RAD51 in response to DNA damage. By helping repair DNA, these three proteins play a role in maintaining the stability of a cell's genetic information.The RAD51 protein is also thought to be involved in the development of nervous system functions that control movement, but its role in this development is unclear.","Congenital mirror movement disorder At least four RAD51 gene mutations have been identified in people with congenital mirror movement disorder, a condition in which intentional movements of one side of the body are mirrored by involuntary movements of the other side. These mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the RAD51 protein sequence, or introduce a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the protein, resulting in an impaired or missing protein. It is unknown how this shortage of functional RAD51 protein affects nervous system development and results in the signs and symptoms of congenital mirror movement disorder. "
1097,RAF1 ,"Raf-1 proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase","The RAF1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of a signaling pathway called the RAS/MAPK pathway, which transmits chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. RAS/MAPK signaling helps control the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (migration), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).The RAF1 gene belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous.","Noonan syndrome More than 25 mutations causing Noonan syndrome have been identified in the RAF1 gene. Noonan syndrome is characterized by mildly unusual facial characteristics, short stature, heart defects, bleeding problems, skeletal malformations, and many other signs and symptoms. The RAF1 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the RAF1 protein. These changes increase protein activity and disrupt the regulation of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway causing problems with cell division, apoptosis, cell differentiation, and cell migration. Researchers believe that this disruption in normal cell processes plays a role in the signs and symptoms of Noonan syndrome, specifically cardiac abnormalities. It has been noted that people with Noonan syndrome caused by a RAF1 gene mutation have a greater incidence of heart defects than other people with Noonan syndrome, specifically a condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a thickening of the heart muscle that forces the heart to work harder to pump blood. "
1098,RAG1 ,recombination activating 1,"The RAG1 gene provides instructions for making a member of a group of proteins called the RAG complex. This complex is active in immune system cells (lymphocytes) called B cells and T cells. These cells have special proteins on their surface that recognize foreign invaders and help protect the body from infection. These proteins need to be diverse to be able to recognize a wide variety of substances. The genes from which these proteins are made contain segments known as variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments. During protein production within lymphocytes, these gene segments are rearranged in different combinations to increase variability of the resulting proteins. The RAG complex is involved in this process, which is known as V(D)J recombination.During V(D)J recombination, the RAG complex attaches (binds) to a section of DNA called a recombination signal sequence (RSS), which is next to a V, D, or J segment. The RAG complex makes small cuts in the DNA between the segment and the RSS so the segment can be separated and moved to a different area in the gene. This process of DNA rearrangement within B cells and T cells is repeated multiple times in different areas so that the V, D, and J segments are arranged in various combinations. The variety of proteins produced throughout life following V(D)J recombination provides greater recognition of foreign invaders and allows the body to fight infection efficiently.","Omenn syndrome At least 70 mutations in the RAG1 gene have been found to cause an immune system disorder called Omenn syndrome. This condition is a type of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which is a group of disorders characterized by an almost total lack of immune protection from foreign invaders such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Omenn syndrome is characterized by a reduced ability to fight infections and autoimmunity, in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. Without treatment, Omenn syndrome is often fatal in infancy.Most of the RAG1 gene mutations that cause Omenn syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the RAG1 protein. These changes can impair RAG complex formation and function, including its ability to bind to DNA. As a result, V(D)J recombination is diminished and the diversity of proteins on the surface of B cells and T cell is severely limited, impairing the cells' ability to recognize foreign invaders and fight infections. The abnormal B and T cells result in the frequent, life-threatening infections of Omenn syndrome. The decrease in lymphocyte function leads to a reduction in the numbers of B cells, but the number of T cells is typically normal. The abnormal T cells attack the body's own cells and tissues, accounting for the autoimmune features of Omenn syndrome. "
1099,RAG2 ,recombination activating 2,"The RAG2 gene provides instructions for making a member of a group of proteins called the RAG complex. This complex is active in immune system cells (lymphocytes) called B cells and T cells. These cells have special proteins on their surface that recognize foreign invaders and help protect the body from infection.

The variety of proteins produced throughout life following V(D)J recombination provides greater recognition of foreign invaders and allows the body to fight infection efficiently.","Omenn syndrome More than 20 mutations in the RAG2 gene have been found to cause an immune system disorder called Omenn syndrome. This condition is a type of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which is a group of disorders characterized by an almost total lack of immune protection from foreign invaders such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Omenn syndrome is characterized by a reduced ability to fight infections and autoimmunity, in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs.

1100,RAI1 ,retinoic acid induced 1,"The RAI1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is active in cells throughout the body, particularly nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. Located in the nucleus of the cell, the RAI1 protein helps control the activity (expression) of certain genes. Most of the genes regulated by RAI1 have not been identified. However, studies suggest that this protein controls the expression of several genes involved in daily (circadian) rhythms, such as the sleep-wake cycle. The RAI1 protein also appears to play a role in development of the brain and of bones in the head and face (craniofacial bones).","Potocki-Lupski syndrome Having an extra copy of the RAI1 gene in each cell is thought to underlie many of the major features of Potocki-Lupski syndrome. This condition is characterized by delayed development, mild to moderate intellectual disability, behavioral problems including autism spectrum disorder (which affects social interaction and communication), sleep disturbances, and other health problems. The condition results from abnormal copying (duplication) of a small piece of the short (p) arm of chromosome 17 at position p11.2. In about two-thirds of affected individuals, the duplicated segment includes approximately 3.7 million DNA building blocks (base pairs), also written as 3.7 megabases (Mb). (A deletion of this segment causes Smith-Magenis syndrome, described below.) In the remaining one-third of cases, the duplication is larger or smaller, ranging from less than 1 Mb to almost 20 Mb. All of these duplications affect one of the two copies of chromosome 17 in each cell.All of the duplications known to cause Potocki-Lupski syndrome contain the RAI1 gene. Studies suggest that the duplication increases the amount of RAI1 protein, which disrupts the expression of genes that influence circadian rhythms. These changes may account for the sleep disturbances that occur with Potocki-Lupski syndrome. Too much RAI1 protein may also disrupt brain development, which could account for delayed development, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and other neurological features of this condition. Development of the bones in the head and face may also be affected, leading to subtle facial differences in people with Potocki-Lupski syndrome. "
1101,RANBP2 ,RAN binding protein 2,"The RANBP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that typically associates with a protein complex known as the nuclear pore. The nuclear pore is embedded within the membrane that surrounds the cell's nucleus (called the nuclear envelope), forming a channel that allows transport of molecules in and out of the nucleus. The RANBP2 protein is attached to the nuclear pore outside of the nucleus, where it helps regulate the transport of proteins and other molecules through the nuclear pore and also helps modify proteins coming into or out of the nucleus.When found elsewhere in the cell, the RANBP2 protein plays multiple roles during cell division, including breaking down and forming the nuclear envelope and dividing chromosomes. The RANBP2 protein is thought to associate with cell structures called microtubules, which form scaffolding within the cell to help cells maintain their shape. In conjunction with microtubules, the RANBP2 protein helps transport materials within cells.In nerve cells in the brain, the RANBP2 protein is likely involved in the regulation of energy and the maintenance of the protective barrier that allows only certain substances to pass between blood vessels and the brain (the blood-brain barrier).","Acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 At least three mutations in the RANBP2 gene have been found to increase the risk of developing acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1. This condition, also known as susceptibility to infection-induced acute encephalopathy 3 or IIAE3, is a rare type of brain disease (encephalopathy) that occurs following a viral infection such as the flu. These mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the RANBP2 protein, resulting in the production of a protein that cannot function normally either due to altered shape or because it cannot get to the nuclear pore where it is needed.These RANBP2 gene mutations do not cause health problems on their own; it is unclear how they are involved in the process by which a viral infection triggers neurological damage. While individuals with acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 frequently have damage to and often lose their blood-brain barrier, the influence of RANBP2 gene mutations is unknown. Researchers suspect that individuals who develop acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1 produce too many immune system proteins called cytokines in response to the infection. The excess cytokines lead to prolonged inflammation, although the role of the altered RANBP2 protein in this process is unknown. Inflammation is a normal immune system response to injury and foreign invaders (such as viruses). However, excessive inflammation can damage many of the body's tissues. Additionally, certain cytokines can be toxic to nerve cells when present in large amounts. It is suspected that the combination of the altered RANBP2 protein and the abnormal immune response play a role in individuals' susceptibility to recurrent episodes of acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1. In people with acute necrotizing encephalopathy type 1, the virus is not found in nerve cells in the brain or spinal cord (central nervous system), so it is likely that the immune reaction, rather than the infection itself, accounts for the neurological signs and symptoms. "
1102,RAPSN ,receptor associated protein of the synapse,The RAPSN gene provides instructions for making a protein called rapsyn that attaches (binds) to the different parts (subunits) of a protein found in the muscle cell membrane called acetylcholine receptor (AChR). This binding helps keep the receptor subunits together and anchors the AChR protein in the muscle cell membrane. The AChR protein plays a critical role in the normal function of the neuromuscular junction. The neuromuscular junction is the area between the ends of nerve cells and muscle cells where signals are relayed to trigger muscle movement.,"Congenital myasthenic syndrome At least 45 mutations in the RAPSN gene have been found to cause congenital myasthenic syndrome. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the rapsyn protein. A common mutation replaces the amino acid asparagine with the amino acid lysine at position 88 in the rapsyn protein (written as Asn88Lys or N88K). Most mutations in the RAPSN gene result in a reduction in functional rapsyn protein. The lack of rapsyn protein results in decreased binding between rapsyn and the AChR protein, which leads to disorganization of the receptor protein in the muscle cell membrane and a reduction in the number of receptors. As a result, signaling at the neuromuscular junction is decreased, which leads to decreased muscle movement and the muscle weakness characteristic of congenital myasthenic syndrome. "
1103,RARA ,retinoic acid receptor alpha,"The RARA gene provides instructions for making a transcription factor called the retinoic acid receptor, alpha (RARα). A transcription factor is a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. The RARα protein controls the activity (transcription) of genes that are important for the maturation (differentiation) of immature white blood cells beyond a particular stage called the promyelocyte.The RARα protein binds to specific regions of DNA and attracts other proteins that help block (repress) gene transcription, the first step in protein production. In response to a specific signal, the repressive proteins are removed and other proteins that induce gene transcription bind to the RARα protein, allowing gene transcription and cell differentiation.","Acute promyelocytic leukemia Gene mutations can be acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. These mutations are called somatic mutations, and they are not inherited. A somatic mutation involving the RARA gene causes acute promyelocytic leukemia, a cancer of the blood forming tissue (bone marrow). Acute promyelocytic leukemia is characterized by an accumulation of promyelocytes in the bone marrow. A rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 15 and 17, written as t(15;17), fuses part of the RARA gene on chromosome 17 with part of another gene on chromosome 15 called PML. The protein produced from this fused gene, the PML-RARα protein, functions differently than the protein products of the normal PML and RARA genes.The PML-RARα protein binds to DNA and represses gene transcription, like the normal RARα protein. However, the PML-RARα protein does not respond to the signal to induce transcription of genes, so the genes remain repressed.Additionally, the function of the PML protein, the product of the PML gene, is disrupted. The PML protein blocks cell growth and division (proliferation) and induces self-destruction (apoptosis) in combination with other proteins. However, the PML-RARα protein does not block proliferation or induce apoptosis.The PML-RARα protein blocks the differentiation of blood cells at the promyelocyte stage and allows abnormal cell proliferation. As a result, excess promyelocytes accumulate in the bone marrow and normal white blood cells cannot form, leading to acute promyelocytic leukemia. "
1104,RARS2 ,"arginyl-tRNA synthetase 2, mitochondrial","The RARS2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called mitochondrial arginyl-tRNA synthetase. This enzyme is active in cell structures called mitochondria. Each cell contains hundreds or thousands of mitochondria, which convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use.Mitochondrial arginyl-tRNA synthetase interacts with a molecule called transfer RNA (tRNA). This molecule, which is a chemical cousin of DNA, helps assemble protein building blocks called amino acids into functioning proteins. To build new proteins, tRNA must collect different amino acids and then attach them to one another in the correct order. Mitochondrial arginyl-tRNA synthetase is one of several enzymes that link amino acids to tRNA. Specifically, this enzyme links the amino acid arginine to the tRNA molecule, which then incorporates it into new proteins in mitochondria.","Pontocerebellar hypoplasia At least 13 mutations in the RARS2 gene have been identified in people with a disorder of brain development called pontocerebellar hypoplasia. The major features of this condition include delayed development, problems with movement, and intellectual disability. Most of the known RARS2 gene mutations cause a form of the disorder designated pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 6 (PCH6). One mutation has been found in an individual with the characteristic features of another form of the condition, pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1 (PCH1).The RARS2 gene mutations that cause pontocerebellar hypoplasia significantly reduce or eliminate the function of mitochondrial arginyl-tRNA synthetase. A loss of this enzyme's function likely disrupts the production of new proteins in mitochondria. However, it is unknown how these changes lead to abnormal brain development in people with pontocerebellar hypoplasia. "
1105,RASA1 ,RAS p21 protein activator 1,"The RASA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called p120-RasGAP. This protein helps regulate the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, which transmits signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. The RAS/MAPK signaling pathway helps direct several important cell functions, including the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), and cell movement. The p120-RasGAP protein is a negative regulator of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, which means it is involved in turning off these signals when they are not needed.The exact role of p120-RasGAP is not fully understood. However, it appears to be essential for the normal development of the vascular system, which is the complex network of arteries, veins, and capillaries that carry blood to and from the heart.","Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome Several dozen mutations in the RASA1 gene have been found to cause capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome (CM-AVM), which is a condition characterized by abnormalities of the vascular system. Most of the mutations responsible for CM-AVM prevent the production of functional p120-RasGAP protein. As a result, this protein is unavailable to control RAS/MAPK signaling. It is unclear how changes in this tightly regulated signaling pathway lead to the specific vascular abnormalities seen in people with CM-AVM. "
1106,RB1 ,RB transcriptional corepressor 1,"The RB1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called pRB. This protein acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it regulates cell growth and keeps cells from dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way. Under certain conditions, pRB stops other proteins from triggering DNA replication, the process by which DNA makes a copy of itself. Because DNA replication must occur before a cell can divide, tight regulation of this process controls cell division and helps prevent the growth of tumors. Additionally, pRB interacts with other proteins to influence cell survival, the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis), and the process by which cells mature to carry out special functions (differentiation).","Retinoblastoma Hundreds of mutations in the RB1 gene have been identified in people with retinoblastoma, a rare type of eye cancer that typically affects young children. This cancer develops in the retina, which is the specialized light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. Researchers estimate that 40 percent of all retinoblastomas are germinal, which means that RB1 mutations occur in all of the body's cells and can be passed to the next generation. The other 60 percent are non-germinal, which means that RB1 mutations occur only in the eye and cannot be passed to the next generation.In germinal retinoblastoma, an RB1 mutation is present in all of the body's cells. For retinoblastoma to develop, the other copy of the RB1 gene also must be mutated or lost. This second mutation typically occurs early in life in retinal cells. Cells with two altered copies of the RB1 gene produce no functional pRB and are unable to regulate cell division effectively. As a result, retinal cells lacking functional pRB can divide uncontrollably to form cancerous tumors. Some studies suggest that additional genetic changes can influence the development of retinoblastoma; these changes may help explain variations in the development and growth of tumors in different people.In people with germinal retinoblastoma, RB1 mutations increase the risk of several other cancers outside the eye. Specifically, these people are more likely to develop a cancer of the pineal gland in the brain (pinealoma), a type of bone cancer known as osteosarcoma, cancers of soft tissues such as muscle, and an aggressive form of skin cancer called melanoma.Non-germinal retinoblastoma occurs in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Affected individuals are born with two normal copies of the RB1 gene. Then, usually in early childhood, both copies of the gene in retinal cells acquire mutations or are lost. These genetic changes prevent the cells from producing any functional pRB. The loss of this protein allows retinal cells to grow and divide without control or order, leading to the development of a cancerous tumor. "
1107,RBM8A ,RNA binding motif protein 8A,"The RBM8A gene provides instructions for making a protein called RNA-binding motif protein 8A. This protein is believed to be involved in several important cellular functions involving protein production. These functions include helping to transport molecules called messenger RNA (mRNA), which serve as the genetic blueprint for making proteins. RNA-binding motif protein 8A likely carries mRNA molecules from the nucleus to areas of the cell where proteins are assembled. It may also be involved in controlling how the instructions in mRNA molecules are used to build proteins and in destroying mRNA that is defective or not needed.","Thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome Mutations in the RBM8A gene cause thrombocytopenia-absent radius (TAR) syndrome. This disorder is characterized by the absence of a bone called the radius in each forearm and a shortage (deficiency) of blood cells involved in clotting (platelets).Most people with TAR syndrome have a mutation in one copy of the RBM8A gene and a deletion of genetic material from chromosome 1 that includes the other copy of the RBM8A gene in each cell. A small number of affected individuals have mutations in both copies of the RBM8A gene in each cell and do not have a deletion on chromosome 1. RBM8A gene mutations that cause TAR syndrome reduce the amount of RNA-binding motif protein 8A in cells. The deletions involved in TAR syndrome eliminate at least 200,000 DNA building blocks (200 kilobases, or 200 kb) from the long (q) arm of chromosome 1 in a region called 1q21.1. The deletion eliminates one copy of the RBM8A gene in each cell and the RNA-binding motif protein 8A that would have been produced from it.People with either an RBM8A gene mutation and a chromosome 1 deletion or with two gene mutations have a decreased amount of RNA-binding motif protein 8A. This reduction is thought to cause problems in the development of certain tissues, but it is unknown how it causes the specific signs and symptoms of TAR syndrome. No cases have been reported in which a deletion that includes the RBM8A gene occurs on both copies of chromosome 1; studies indicate that the complete loss of RNA-binding motif protein 8A is not compatible with life. "
1108,RBPJ ,recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region,"The RBPJ gene provides instructions for making a protein called RBP-J, which is an integral part of a signaling pathway known as the Notch pathway. Notch signaling controls how certain types of cells develop in the growing embryo, including those that form the bones, heart, muscles, nerves, and blood. Signaling through the Notch pathway stimulates the RBP-J protein to attach (bind) to specific regions of DNA and control the activity of genes that play a role in cellular development.","Adams-Oliver syndrome Mutations in the RBPJ gene lead to Adams-Oliver syndrome, a condition characterized by areas of missing skin (aplasia cutis congenita), usually on the scalp, and malformations of the hands and feet. These mutations change single protein building blocks in the RBP-J protein, altering the region of the protein that normally binds to DNA. The altered proteins are unable to bind to DNA, preventing the activation of particular genes. These changes in gene activity impair the proper development of the skin on the top of the head and the bones in the hands and feet. It is unclear why impaired development primarily affects these tissues. "
1109,RDH5 ,retinol dehydrogenase 5,"The RDH5 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase 5, which is necessary for normal vision, especially in low-light conditions (night vision). This enzyme is found in a thin layer of cells at the back of the eye called the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). This cell layer supports and nourishes the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue in the inner lining of the back of the eye (the fundus).11-cis retinol dehydrogenase 5 is involved in a multi-step process called the visual cycle, by which light entering the eye is converted into electrical signals that are interpreted as vision. An integral operation of the visual cycle is the recycling of a molecule called 11-cis retinal, which is a form of vitamin A that is needed for the conversion of light to electrical signals. The retinol dehydrogenase 5 enzyme converts a molecule called 11-cis retinol to 11-cis retinal. In light-sensing cells in the retina known as photoreceptors, 11-cis retinal combines with a protein called an opsin to form a photosensitive pigment. When light hits this pigment, 11-cis retinal is altered, forming another molecule called all-trans retinal. This conversion triggers a series of chemical reactions that create electrical signals. 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase 5 then helps convert all-trans retinal back to 11-cis retinal so the visual cycle can begin again.The eyes contain two types of photoreceptors, rods and cones. Rods are needed for vision in low light, while cones are needed for vision in bright light, including color vision. Rods primarily use 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase 5 to generate 11-cis retinal. Cones also use 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase 5, but they are thought to have additional pathways to produce 11-cis retinal.","Fundus albipunctatus At least 48 mutations in the RDH5 gene have been found to cause fundus albipunctatus, a condition characterized by impaired night vision and whitish-yellow flecks in the retina. The RDH5 gene mutations are thought to reduce or eliminate the function of the 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase 5 enzyme, which results in a shortage of 11-cis retinal. Without this important molecule in photoreceptors, electrical signals integral for vision are not stimulated, and vision is impaired. Because rods rely on 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase 5 for 11-cis retinal production, vision in low light is particularly affected by impairment of this enzyme's function. Researchers speculate that impairment of 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase 5 also leads to the accumulation of 11-cis retinol and related molecules, forming the flecks characteristic of fundus albipunctatus. "
1110,RECQL4 ,RecQ like helicase 4,"The RECQL4 gene provides instructions for making one member of a protein family called RecQ helicases. Helicases are enzymes that bind to DNA and temporarily unwind the two spiral strands (double helix) of the DNA molecule. This unwinding is necessary for copying (replicating) DNA in preparation for cell division, and for repairing damaged DNA. Because RecQ helicases maintain the structure and integrity of DNA, they are known as the ""caretakers of the genome.""The RECQL4 protein is active in several types of cells before and after birth. Researchers believe that this protein is particularly important in cells of the developing bones and skin. It has also been found in enterocytes, which are cells that line the intestine and absorb nutrients.","Baller-Gerold syndrome Several mutations in the RECQL4 gene have been identified in people with Baller-Gerold syndrome. Most of these mutations prevent the production of any RECQL4 protein or change the way the protein is pieced together, which disrupts its usual function. A shortage of this protein may prevent normal DNA replication and repair, causing widespread damage to a person's genetic information over time. It is unclear how these changes result in the varied signs and symptoms of Baller-Gerold syndrome, including the abnormal fusion of certain skull bones (craniosynostosis), small stature, missing thumbs or bones in the forearm (radial ray malformations), and a skin rash. "
1111,REEP1 ,receptor accessory protein 1,"The REEP1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called receptor expression-enhancing protein 1 (REEP1), which is found in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and spinal cord. The REEP1 protein is located within cell compartments called mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers in cells, and the endoplasmic reticulum, which helps with protein processing and transport.The REEP1 protein plays a role in forming the network of tubules that make up the structure of the endoplasmic reticulum, regulating its size and determining how many proteins it can process. As part of its role in the endoplasmic reticulum, the REEP1 protein enhances the activity of certain other proteins called G protein-coupled receptors. These receptor proteins are eventually embedded within the outer membrane of cells, where they relay chemical signals from outside the cell to the interior of the cell.The function of the REEP1 protein in the mitochondria is unknown.","Distal hereditary motor neuropathy, type V Genetics Home Reference provides information about distal hereditary motor neuropathy, type V. "
1112,RELN ,reelin,"The RELN gene provides instructions for making a protein called reelin. This protein is produced in the brain both before and after birth. Reelin is released by certain brain cells; then it attaches (binds) to specific receptor proteins. In the developing brain, this binding turns on (activates) a signaling pathway that triggers nerve cells (neurons) to migrate to their proper locations.After birth, reelin likely plays a role in many brain processes, including the extension of axons and dendrites, which are specialized outgrowths from nerve cells that are essential for the transmission of nerve impulses. Reelin may also regulate synaptic plasticity, which is the ability of connections between neurons (synapses) to change and adapt over time in response to experience. Additionally, reelin controls the release of chemicals that relay signals in the nervous system (neurotransmitters).","Lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia At least six mutations in the RELN gene have been found to cause lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia (LCH). This condition affects brain development, resulting in the brain having a smooth appearance (lissencephaly) instead of its normal folds and grooves. In addition, the brain region involved in coordinating movements is unusually small and underdeveloped (cerebellar hypoplasia). The RELN gene mutations that cause LCH lead to a complete lack of reelin. As a result, the signaling pathway that triggers neuronal migration is not activated. Without reelin, neurons are disorganized, the normal folds and grooves of the brain do not form, and brain structures do not develop properly. This impairment of brain development leads to intellectual disability, delayed overall development, movement problems, and other signs and symptoms of LCH. "
1113,REN ,renin,"The REN gene provides instructions for making a protein called renin, which is produced in the kidneys. This protein is part of the renin-angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure and the balance of fluids and salts in the body. In the first step of this process, renin converts a protein called angiotensinogen into angiotensin I. Through an additional step, angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to narrow (constrict), which results in increased blood pressure. Angiotensin II also stimulates production of the hormone aldosterone, which triggers the absorption of water and salt by the kidneys. The increased amount of fluid in the body also increases blood pressure. Proper blood pressure during fetal growth, which delivers oxygen to the developing tissues, is required for normal development of the kidneys, particularly of structures called the proximal tubules, and other tissues. In addition, angiotensin II may play a more direct role in kidney development, perhaps by affecting growth factors involved in development of kidney structures.","REN-related kidney disease At least four mutations in the REN gene have been found to cause REN-related kidney disease, a condition in which the kidneys become less able to filter fluids and waste products from the body, resulting in kidney failure. Individuals with this condition have one mutated copy and one normal copy of the REN gene in each cell. The mutations involved in REN-related kidney disease either change or remove a protein building block (amino acid) in the renin protein. These changes occur in a region of the protein known as the signal sequence, and they impair normal processing of renin. The abnormal protein is toxic to the kidney cells that normally produce renin. The renin-producing cells gradually die off, which disrupts the renin-angiotensin system and causes progressive kidney disease. "
1114,RERE ,arginine-glutamic acid dipeptide repeats,"The RERE gene provides instructions for making a protein that is critical for normal development before birth. This protein interacts with other proteins called transcription factors, which control the activity (transcription) of particular genes. The RERE protein helps these transcription factors turn on (activate) and turn off (repress) a number of genes important for early development, ensuring that the genes are activated (expressed) at the right time and place for proper tissue formation. Research indicates that the RERE protein plays a role in the development of the brain, eyes, inner ear, heart, and kidneys.","Neurodevelopmental disorder with or without anomalies of the brain, eye, or heart More than 15 mutations in the RERE gene have been found to cause a condition called neurodevelopmental disorder with or without anomalies of the brain, eye, or heart (NEDBEH). This condition primarily affects brain development, causing intellectual disability, delayed development, or autism spectrum disorder, which is a condition that affects communication and social interaction. Abnormalities of other body systems, including the eyes, heart, inner ear, or kidneys, can also occur.Many of the RERE gene mutations that cause NEDBEH change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides). Other mutations add or remove nucleotides. Researchers suspect that these genetic changes reduce or eliminate the function of the RERE protein. A shortage of RERE protein function likely alters the activity of many genes involved in development before birth. These changes prevent the normal development of tissues in the brain, eyes, heart, and other organs. Researchers are working to identify which genes are affected and how changes in their activity lead to the signs and symptoms of NEDBEH.It is unknown why some people with NEDBEH have only neurological problems and others also have structural abnormalities. Researchers suspect that the severity of the condition may be related to the location and type of mutation in the RERE gene. Additional genetic factors that have not been identified, including variations in other genes, may also help determine which body systems are affected. "
1115,RET ,ret proto-oncogene,"The RET gene provides instructions for producing a protein that is involved in signaling within cells. This protein appears to be essential for the normal development of several kinds of nerve cells, including nerves in the intestine (enteric neurons) and the portion of the nervous system that controls involuntary body functions such as heart rate (the autonomic nervous system). The RET protein is also necessary for normal kidney development and the production of sperm (spermatogenesis).The RET protein spans the cell membrane, so that one end of the protein remains inside the cell and the other end projects from the outer surface of the cell. This positioning of the protein allows it to interact with specific factors outside the cell and to receive signals that help the cell respond to its environment. When molecules that stimulate growth and development (growth factors) attach to the RET protein, a complex cascade of chemical reactions inside the cell is triggered. These reactions instruct the cell to undergo certain changes, such as dividing or maturing to take on specialized functions.","Hirschsprung disease Mutations in the RET gene are the most common genetic cause of Hirschsprung disease, a disorder that causes severe constipation or blockage of the intestine. More than 200 RET gene mutations are known to cause this condition. These genetic changes result in a nonfunctional version of the RET protein that cannot interact with growth factors or transmit signals within cells. Without RET protein signaling, enteric nerves do not develop properly. These nerves control contractions that move stool through the intestine, and their absence leads to the intestinal problems characteristic of Hirschsprung disease. "
1116,RETREG1 ,reticulophagy regulator 1,"The RETREG1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in a cellular process called autophagy. Cells use this process to recycle worn-out or unnecessary cell parts and break down certain proteins when they are no longer needed. In particular, the RETREG1 protein helps direct autophagy of a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is important in protein processing and transport. Autophagy may be a way for the cell to remove parts of the endoplasmic reticulum when they are no longer needed or to break down excess or abnormal proteins that are being processed within the structure.The RETREG1 protein also appears to be important in the organization of another cell structure called the Golgi apparatus, which is important for distribution of proteins within the cell.The RETREG1 protein is found in sensory and autonomic nerve cells (neurons). Sensory neurons transmit pain, touch, and temperature sensations. Autonomic neurons help control involuntary functions of the body such as heart rate and blood pressure.","Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type II Mutations in the RETREG1 gene are responsible for one type of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type II (HSAN2) called HSAN2B; at least five mutations have been identified in affected individuals. People with HSAN2B lose the ability to feel pain or sense hot and cold. The RETREG1 gene mutations may lead to an abnormally short and nonfunctional protein. The resulting lack of functioning RETREG1 protein impairs autophagy of the endoplasmic reticulum and alters the structure of the Golgi apparatus in sensory and autonomic neurons.Researchers suspect that an inability to break down parts of the endoplasmic reticulum when they are no longer needed, and the subsequent accumulation of these structures and other proteins in cells, leads to cell death. The loss of sensory and autonomic neurons due to impaired autophagy results in the signs and symptoms of HSAN2B. It is unclear what role abnormalities of the Golgi apparatus play in the condition. "
1117,RFX5 ,regulatory factor X5,"The RFX5 gene provides instructions for making a protein that primarily helps control the activity (transcription) of genes called major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes. Transcription is the first step in the production of proteins, and RFX5 is critical for the production of specialized immune proteins called MHC class II proteins from these genes.The RFX5 protein is part of a group of proteins called the regulatory factor X (RFX) complex. This complex attaches to a specific region of DNA involved in the regulation of MHC class II gene activity. The RFX5 protein helps the complex attach to the correct region of DNA. The RFX complex attracts other necessary proteins to this region and helps turn on MHC class II gene transcription, allowing production of MHC class II proteins.MHC class II proteins are found on the surface of several types of immune cells, including white blood cells (lymphocytes) that are involved in immune reactions. These proteins play an important role in the body's immune response to foreign invaders, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. To help the body recognize and fight infections, MHC class II proteins bind to fragments of proteins (peptides) from foreign invaders so that other specialized immune system cells can interact with them. When these immune system cells recognize the peptides as harmful, they trigger the lymphocytes and other immune cells to launch immune responses to get rid of the foreign invaders.The RFX complex also appears to play a role in the transcription of MHC class I genes, which provide instructions for making immune system proteins called MHC class I proteins. Like MHC class II proteins, MHC class I proteins attach to peptides from foreign invaders and present them to specific immune system cells. These cells then attack the foreign invaders to rid them from the body. While the RFX complex is able to help control MHC class I gene activity, it is not the primary regulator of these genes. Other proteins play a more prominent role in their transcription.","Bare lymphocyte syndrome type II At least seven mutations in the RFX5 gene have been found to cause an immune system disorder called bare lymphocyte syndrome type II (BLS II). BLS II is a type of combined immunodeficiency (CID), in which affected individuals have virtually no immune protection from foreign invaders. Consequently, individuals with BLS II have persistent infections in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary tracts, which can be life-threatening.Mutations in the RFX5 gene lead to production of an abnormally short RFX5 protein that likely does not function properly. These changes impair binding of the RFX complex to DNA, which prevents transcription of MHC class II proteins. Consequently, lymphocytes lack any MHC class II proteins on their surface, and the body has difficulty getting rid of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, leading to the persistent infections characteristic of BLS II. "
1118,RFXANK ,regulatory factor X associated ankyrin containing protein,"The RFXANK gene provides instructions for making a protein that primarily helps control the activity (transcription) of genes called major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes. Transcription is the first step in the production of proteins, and RFXANK is critical for the production of specialized immune proteins called MHC class II proteins from these genes.The RFXANK protein is part of a group of proteins called the regulatory factor X (RFX) complex.

Other proteins play a more prominent role in their transcription.","Bare lymphocyte syndrome type II Mutations in the RFXANK gene are the most common genetic cause of an immune system disorder known as bare lymphocyte syndrome type II (BLS II). More than 40 mutations in this gene have been identified in affected individuals. BLS II is a type of combined immunodeficiency (CID), in which affected individuals have virtually no immune protection from foreign invaders. Consequently, individuals with BLS II have persistent infections in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary tracts, which can be life-threatening.Mutations in the RFXANK gene lead to production of an altered protein that likely does not function properly. These changes impair binding of the RFX complex to DNA, which prevents transcription of MHC class II proteins. Consequently, lymphocytes lack any MHC class II proteins on their surface, and the body has difficulty getting rid of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, leading to the persistent infections characteristic of BLS II. "
1119,RFXAP ,regulatory factor X associated protein,"The RFXAP gene provides instructions for making a protein called RFX associated protein (RFXAP). It primarily helps control the activity (transcription) of genes called major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes. Transcription is the first step in the production of proteins, and RFXAP is critical for the production of specialized immune proteins called MHC class II proteins from these genes.The RFXAP protein is part of a group of proteins called the regulatory factor X (RFX) complex.

These changes impair binding of the RFX complex to DNA, which prevents transcription of MHC class II proteins. Consequently, lymphocytes lack any MHC class II proteins on their surface, and the body has difficulty getting rid of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, leading to the persistent infections characteristic of BLS II. "
1120,RGS9 ,regulator of G protein signaling 9,"The RGS9 gene provides instructions for making two versions (isoforms) of the RGS9 protein, known as RGS9-1 and RGS9-2. They are found in different parts of the nervous system and have very different functions.RGS9-1 is produced in the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. Within the retina, RGS9-1 is associated with light-detecting cells called photoreceptors. When light enters the eye, it stimulates specialized pigments in these cells. This stimulation triggers a series of chemical reactions that produce an electrical signal, which is interpreted by the brain as vision. (This process is known as phototransduction.) Once photoreceptors have been stimulated by light, they must return to their resting state before they can be stimulated again. RGS9-1 is involved in a chemical reaction that helps return photoreceptors to their resting state quickly after light exposure.RGS9-2 is found primarily in an area deep within the brain called the striatum. Although its exact role is unknown, RGS9-2 appears to be part of signaling pathways involving a chemical messenger (neurotransmitter) called dopamine. These pathways are important for planning and coordinating movement. Studies suggest that RGS9-2 also plays a role in the brain's response to opioid drugs, such as morphine and cocaine.","Bradyopsia At least two mutations in the RGS9 gene have been found to cause bradyopsia, a rare condition that affects vision. In people with bradyopsia, the eyes adapt more slowly than usual to changing light conditions (for example, walking out of a darkened movie theater into daylight or driving into a dark tunnel on a sunny day). Some affected individuals also have difficulty seeing small moving objects, such as a tennis ball.The RGS9 gene mutations that cause bradyopsia greatly reduce or eliminate the function of RGS9-1 in photoreceptors. (These mutations do not appear to affect the function of RGS9-2 in the brain.) A loss of RGS9-1 function prevents photoreceptors from recovering quickly after responding to light. Normally they return to their resting state in a fraction of a second, but in people with RGS9 gene mutations, it can take ten seconds or longer. During that time, the photoreceptors cannot respond to light. This delay causes temporary blindness in response to changing light conditions and may interfere with seeing small objects when they are in motion. "
1121,RGS9BP ,regulator of G protein signaling 9 binding protein,"The RGS9BP gene (which is also known as R9AP) provides instructions for making a protein called RGS9 binding protein. This protein is found in the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. Within the retina, the protein is associated with light-detecting cells called photoreceptors. As its name suggests, RGS9 binding protein interacts with a protein called RGS9 (which is produced from the RGS9 gene). It anchors the RGS9 protein to photoreceptors and stimulates RGS9's activity.When light enters the eye, it stimulates specialized pigments in photoreceptor cells. This stimulation triggers a series of chemical reactions that produce an electrical signal, which is interpreted by the brain as vision. (This process is known as phototransduction.) Once photoreceptors have been stimulated by light, they must return to their resting state before they can be stimulated again. RGS9 and RGS9 binding protein are involved in a chemical reaction that helps return photoreceptors to their resting state quickly after light exposure.","Bradyopsia At least six mutations in the RGS9BP gene have been found to cause bradyopsia, a rare condition that affects vision. In people with bradyopsia, the eyes adapt more slowly than usual to changing light conditions (for example, walking out of a darkened movie theater into daylight or driving into a dark tunnel on a sunny day). Some affected individuals also have difficulty seeing small moving objects, such as a tennis ball.The RGS9BP gene mutations that cause bradyopsia prevent RGS9 binding protein from anchoring the RGS9 protein to photoreceptor cells. The resulting loss of RGS9 protein function prevents photoreceptors from recovering quickly after responding to light. Normally they return to their resting state in a fraction of a second, but in people with RGS9BP gene mutations, it can take ten seconds or longer. During that time, the photoreceptors cannot respond to light. This delay causes temporary blindness in response to changing light conditions and may interfere with seeing small objects when they are in motion. "
1122,RHO ,rhodopsin,"The RHO gene provides instructions for making a protein called rhodopsin. This protein is necessary for normal vision, particularly in low-light conditions. Rhodopsin is found in specialized light receptor cells called rods. As part of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina), rods provide vision in low light. Other light receptor cells in the retina, called cones, are responsible for vision in bright light.The rhodopsin protein is attached (bound) to a molecule called 11-cis retinal, which is a form of vitamin A. When light hits this molecule, it activates rhodopsin and sets off a series of chemical reactions that create electrical signals. These signals are transmitted to the brain, where they are interpreted as vision.","Autosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness At least four mutations in the RHO gene have been found to cause autosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness, which is characterized by a loss of vision in low light that remains stable (stationary) over time. Unlike retinitis pigmentosa (described below), autosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness does not affect daytime vision.The RHO gene mutations responsible for autosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness cause the rhodopsin protein to be constantly turned on (constitutively active). Because the protein no longer needs light to be activated, the signals that rod cells send to the brain are constantly occurring, even in bright light. Visual information from rod cells is then perceived by the brain as not meaningful, resulting in night blindness.Researchers are uncertain why some constitutively activating mutations in the RHO gene cause congenital stationary night blindness and others result in the more severe vision loss associated with retinitis pigmentosa. "
1123,RIT1 ,Ras like without CAAX 1,"The RIT1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps cells survive during periods of cellular stress, such as unusually high energy demands. As part of a signaling pathway known as the RAS/MAPK pathway, the RIT1 protein relays signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. These signals instruct the cell to grow and divide (proliferate) or to mature and take on specialized functions (differentiate). The RIT1 protein is a GTPase, which means it converts a molecule called GTP into another molecule called GDP. To transmit signals during periods of cellular stress, the RIT1 protein is turned on by attaching (binding) to a molecule of GTP. The RIT1 protein is turned off (inactivated) when it converts the GTP to GDP. When the protein is bound to GDP, it does not relay signals to the cell's nucleus.The RIT1 gene belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous. The RIT1 gene is in the Ras family of oncogenes, which also includes three other genes: KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS. These proteins play important roles in cell division, cell differentiation, and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).","Noonan syndrome At least 14 mutations in the RIT1 gene have been found to cause Noonan syndrome. This condition is characterized by mildly unusual facial characteristics, short stature, heart defects, bleeding problems, skeletal malformations, and many other signs and symptoms. People with Noonan syndrome caused by RIT1 gene mutations often have swelling caused by a buildup of fluid (lymphedema). Rarely, people with Noonan syndrome caused by a RIT1 gene mutation develop cancer, including a blood cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukemia.The RIT1 gene mutations associated with Noonan syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the RIT1 protein. The mutations lead to the production of an altered RIT1 protein that is either continuously turned on (active) or has prolonged activation, rather than promptly switching on and off in response to other cellular proteins. The abnormally active protein alters normal RAS/MAPK signaling and leads to abnormal cell proliferation, which disrupts the development of organs and tissues throughout the body, resulting in the signs and symptoms of Noonan syndrome. "
1124,RMRP ,RNA component of mitochondrial RNA processing endoribonuclease,"Unlike many genes, the RMRP gene does not contain instructions for making a protein. Instead, a molecule called a noncoding RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA, is produced from the RMRP gene. Several proteins attach (bind) to this RNA molecule, forming an enzyme called mitochondrial RNA-processing endoribonuclease, or RNase MRP.The RNase MRP enzyme is thought to be involved in several important processes in the cell. For example, it likely helps copy (replicate) the DNA found in the energy-producing centers of cells (mitochondria). The RNase MRP enzyme also processes ribosomal RNA, which is required for assembling protein building blocks (amino acids) into functioning proteins. In addition, this enzyme helps control the cell cycle, which is the cell's way of replicating itself in an organized, step-by-step fashion.","Anauxetic dysplasia At least four RMRP gene mutations have been identified in people with anauxetic dysplasia, a disorder characterized by severe short stature (dwarfism) and other skeletal abnormalities. The RMRP gene mutations that cause anauxetic dysplasia alter the noncoding RNA produced from the gene, and the RNase MRP enzyme containing the altered noncoding RNA is impaired in its ribosomal RNA processing function. Although the specific mechanism is unknown, impairment of this function likely disrupts skeletal development, leading to the signs and symptoms of anauxetic dysplasia. "
1125,RNASEH2A ,ribonuclease H2 subunit A,"The RNASEH2A gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of a group of proteins called the RNase H2 complex. This complex is a ribonuclease, which means it is an enzyme that helps break down molecules containing RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. In particular, the RNase H2 complex normally helps break down molecules in which one strand of RNA is combined with one strand of DNA (RNA-DNA hybrids) when these molecules are no longer needed. RNA-DNA hybrids are formed during DNA copying (replication) and are found in all cells.The RNase H2 complex is also thought to be involved in DNA replication, error repair, and other cellular processes, including helping to prevent inappropriate immune system activation.","Aicardi-Goutières syndrome At least 42 mutations in the RNASEH2A gene have been identified in people with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, a disorder that involves severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), skin lesions, and other health problems associated with abnormal immune system activation. The RNASEH2A gene mutations that cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome likely result in a dysfunctional RNase H2 complex. Abnormal functioning of this complex may disrupt transcription, DNA replication, DNA repair, cell death (apoptosis), or other processes. Such disruptions are thought to lead to the accumulation of unneeded DNA and RNA in cells. These DNA and RNA fragments may be mistaken for the genetic material of viral invaders, triggering immune system reactions in multiple body systems that cause severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), skin lesions, and other signs and symptoms of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. "
1126,RNASEH2B ,ribonuclease H2 subunit B,"The RNASEH2B gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of a group of proteins called the RNase H2 complex. This complex is a ribonuclease, which means it is an enzyme that helps break down molecules containing RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. In particular, the RNase H2 complex normally helps break down molecules in which one strand of RNA is combined with one strand of DNA (RNA-DNA hybrids) when these molecules are no longer needed. RNA-DNA hybrids are formed during DNA copying (replication) and are found in all cells.The RNase H2 complex is also thought to be involved in DNA replication, error repair, and other cellular processes, including helping to prevent inappropriate immune system activation.","Aicardi-Goutières syndrome At least 76 mutations in the RNASEH2B gene have been identified in people with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, a disorder that involves severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), skin lesions, and other health problems associated with abnormal immune system activation. The RNASEH2B gene mutations that cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome likely result in a dysfunctional RNase H2 complex. Abnormal functioning of this complex may disrupt transcription, DNA replication, DNA repair, cell death (apoptosis), or other processes. Such disruptions are thought to lead to the accumulation of unneeded DNA and RNA in cells. These DNA and RNA fragments may be mistaken for the genetic material of viral invaders, triggering immune system reactions in multiple body systems that cause severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), skin lesions, and other signs and symptoms of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. "
1127,RNASEH2C ,ribonuclease H2 subunit C,"The RNASEH2C gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of a group of proteins called the RNase H2 complex. This complex is a ribonuclease, which means it is an enzyme that helps break down molecules containing RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. In particular, the RNase H2 complex normally helps break down molecules in which one strand of RNA is combined with one strand of DNA (RNA-DNA hybrids) when these molecules are no longer needed. RNA-DNA hybrids are formed during DNA copying (replication) and are found in all cells.The RNase H2 complex is also thought to be involved in DNA replication, error repair, and other cellular processes, including helping to prevent inappropriate immune system activation.","Aicardi-Goutières syndrome At least 26 mutations in the RNASEH2C gene have been identified in people with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, a disorder that involves severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), skin lesions, and other health problems associated with abnormal immune system activation. The RNASEH2C gene mutations that cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome likely result in a dysfunctional RNase H2 complex. Abnormal functioning of this complex may disrupt transcription, DNA replication, DNA repair, cell death (apoptosis), or other processes. Such disruptions are thought to lead to the accumulation of unneeded DNA and RNA in cells. These DNA and RNA fragments may be mistaken for the genetic material of viral invaders, triggering immune system reactions in multiple body systems that cause severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), skin lesions, and other signs and symptoms of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. "
1128,RNASET2 ,ribonuclease T2,"The RNASET2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ribonuclease T2 (RNAse T2), which is abundant in the brain. Ribonucleases help break down RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. Studies suggest that ribonuclease T2 may also be involved in other functions within cells, such as controlling the development of blood vessels (angiogenesis) and helping to prevent the growth of cancerous tumors. These potential roles of the protein are not well understood.","RNAse T2-deficient leukoencephalopathy At least 10 RNASET2 gene mutations have been identified in people with RNAse T2-deficient leukoencephalopathy. This disorder involves brain abnormalities leading to neurological problems that become apparent during infancy, affecting intellectual ability and the development of motor skills such as sitting and crawling.The RNASET2 gene mutations that cause RNAse T2-deficient leukoencephalopathy result in loss of ribonuclease T2 protein function. It is unknown how loss of this protein results in the brain abnormalities and neurological problems characteristic of RNAse T2-deficient leukoencephalopathy. Researchers have noted that the signs and symptoms of RNAse T2-deficient leukoencephalopathy are similar to those resulting from infection by a particular virus, called cytomegalovirus (CMV), when it is transmitted to a fetus during pregnancy (congenital CMV). They are seeking to understand how the viral infection, or the body's response to it, and the loss of ribonuclease T2 function could have similar effects on the developing brain. It is thought that both may be related to changes in angiogenesis or an immune system response to RNA that has not been properly broken down. "
1129,RNF213 ,ring finger protein 213,"The RNF213 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose role is unknown. The RNF213 protein, which is found in tissues throughout the body, contains specific regions (domains) that hint at possible functions. One domain, known as a RING finger, is found in proteins that have an enzyme activity known as E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. Proteins with this activity target other proteins to be broken down (degraded) within cells. Protein degradation is a normal process that removes damaged or unnecessary proteins and helps maintain the normal functions of cells. Proteins with a RING finger domain are involved in many different cellular functions, including cell growth and division, the transmission of chemical signals (signal transduction), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).The RNF213 protein also contains two regions called AAA+ ATPase domains. Proteins with these domains typically regulate mechanical processes in the cell, such as protein unfolding, DNA unwinding, or transporting molecules.Although the function of the RNF213 protein is unknown, studies suggest that it plays a role in the proper development of blood vessels.",Migraine Genetics Home Reference provides information about migraine. 
1130,RNF216 ,ring finger protein 216,"The RNF216 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unwanted proteins. Specifically, this protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. E3 ubiquitin ligases form part of a protein complex that tags damaged or excess proteins with molecules called ubiquitin. Ubiquitin serves as a signal to specialized cell structures known as proteasomes, which attach (bind) to the tagged proteins and degrade them.The RNF216 protein tags proteins involved in an early immune response called inflammation to help control the response. RNF216 also regulates the amount of a protein in nerve cells (neurons) called Arc, which plays a role in a process called synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity is the ability of the connections between neurons (synapses) to change and adapt over time in response to experience. This process is critical for learning and memory. It is likely that the RNF216 protein also regulates proteins involved in other body processes, although these proteins have not been identified.","Gordon Holmes syndrome At least eight RNF216 gene mutations have been found to cause Gordon Holmes syndrome, a rare condition characterized by reduced production of hormones that direct sexual development (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) and difficulty coordinating movements (cerebellar ataxia). Many people with Gordon Holmes syndrome caused by RNF216 gene mutations experience a decline in intellectual function (dementia). These mutations impair the ability of the RNF216 protein to tag unneeded proteins to be broken down. Impaired breakdown of Arc disrupts normal synaptic connections and plasticity, which likely contributes to dementia in people with Gordon Holmes syndrome. It is unclear how a lack of RNF216 protein function causes hypogonadotropic hypogonadism or cerebellar ataxia. "
1131,ROBO3 ,roundabout guidance receptor 3,"The ROBO3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is critical for the normal development of the nervous system. The protein is active in the developing spinal cord and in the brainstem, a region that connects the upper parts of the brain with the spinal cord. In the brainstem, the ROBO3 protein helps direct nerve cells (neurons) to their proper positions in a process called neuronal migration. The protein also helps guide the growth of axons, which are specialized extensions of neurons that transmit nerve impulses throughout the nervous system. Some axons are very long, connecting neurons in the brain with those in the spinal cord and elsewhere in the body.For the brain and body to communicate effectively, certain bundles of axons must cross from one side of the body to the other in the brainstem. These include axons of motor neurons, which transmit information about voluntary muscle movement, and axons of sensory neurons, which transmit information about sensory input (such as touch, pain, and temperature). The ROBO3 protein plays a critical role in ensuring that this crossing over occurs during brain development.","Horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis At least 19 different mutations in the ROBO3 gene have been identified in people with horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS). These mutations change the structure of the ROBO3 protein in different ways; however, all of the mutations appear to result in a nonfunctional protein. A lack of functional ROBO3 protein disrupts normal brainstem development.In people with HGPPS, the axons of motor and sensory neurons do not cross over in the brainstem, but stay on the same side of the body. Researchers believe that this miswiring is the underlying cause of the eye movement abnormalities associated with the disorder. The cause of progressive scoliosis in HGPPS is unclear. Researchers are working to determine why the effects of ROBO3 mutations appear to be limited to horizontal eye movement and scoliosis. "
1132,ROR2 ,receptor tyrosine kinase like orphan receptor 2,"The ROR2 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not well understood. The ROR2 protein is part of a family of proteins known as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which play a role in chemical signaling within cells. RTKs are involved in many cell functions, including cell growth and division (proliferation), the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell survival, and cell movement (motility).Researchers believe that the ROR2 protein plays an essential role in development starting before birth. It is involved in chemical signaling pathways called Wnt signaling, which affect many aspects of development. These pathways control the activity of genes needed at specific times, and they regulate the interactions between cells as organs and tissues are forming. In particular, the ROR2 protein appears to be critical for the normal formation of the skeleton, heart, and genitals.","Robinow syndrome At least 20 mutations in the ROR2 gene have been found to cause the autosomal recessive form of Robinow syndrome, a condition that affects the development of many parts of the body, particularly the bones. Autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. Some of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ROR2 protein, while others lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the protein. Because these genetic changes prevent any functional ROR2 protein from being made, they are described as ""loss-of-function"" mutations. Loss of ROR2 protein function impairs chemical signaling pathways that are important for normal development, particularly the formation of bones in the face, spine, and limbs. These changes lead to the skeletal abnormalities characteristic of Robinow syndrome. A lack of this protein during early development also underlies the other features of Robinow syndrome, including genital abnormalities and heart defects. "
1133,RP2 ,"RP2, ARL3 GTPase activating protein","The RP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is essential for normal vision. The RP2 protein is active in cells throughout the body, including cells that make up the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). However, the function of the RP2 protein is not well understood. Studies suggest that it may be involved in transporting proteins within the retina's specialized light receptor cells (photoreceptors). Its role in other types of cells is unknown.","Retinitis pigmentosa More than 70 mutations in the RP2 gene have been identified in people with the X-linked form of retinitis pigmentosa. This condition primarily affects males, causing night blindness in early childhood followed by progressive daytime vision loss. RP2 gene mutations account for 10 to 15 percent of all cases of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa.Most mutations in the RP2 gene lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the RP2 protein. A few mutations change single building blocks (amino acids) in the RP2 protein. These changes alter the structure and function of the protein, which probably disrupts the stability or maintenance of photoreceptor cells. A gradual loss of photoreceptors underlies the progressive vision loss characteristic of retinitis pigmentosa. "
1134,RPE65 ,"RPE65, retinoid isomerohydrolase","The RPE65 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is essential for normal vision. The RPE65 protein is produced in a thin layer of cells at the back of the eye called the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). This cell layer supports and nourishes the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye.The RPE65 protein is involved in a multi-step process called the visual cycle, which converts light entering the eye into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain. When light hits photosensitive pigments in the retina, it changes a molecule called 11-cis retinal (a form of vitamin A) to another molecule called all-trans retinal. This conversion triggers a series of chemical reactions that create electrical signals. The RPE65 protein then helps convert all-trans retinal back to 11-cis retinal so the visual cycle can begin again.","Leber congenital amaurosis More than 30 mutations in the RPE65 gene have been found to cause Leber congenital amaurosis. Mutations in this gene account for 6 to 16 percent of all cases of this condition.RPE65 gene mutations lead to a partial or total loss of RPE65 protein function. As a result, all-trans retinal cannot be converted back to 11-cis retinal, and excess all-trans retinal builds up in the retinal pigment epithelium. These abnormalities block the visual cycle, which leads to severe visual impairment beginning very early in life. "
1135,RPGR ,retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator,"The RPGR gene provides instructions for making a protein that is essential for normal vision. Although the protein's function is not well understood, studies suggest that it plays an important role in cell structures called cilia. Cilia are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of many types of cells. They are involved in cell movement and many different chemical signaling pathways. Cilia are also necessary for the perception of sensory input, including hearing, smell, and vision.Several different versions (isoforms) of the RPGR protein are produced from the RPGR gene. One version contains a segment known as the ORF15 exon. This version of the RPGR protein is active (expressed) predominantly in the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. Specifically, the ORF15-containing isoform is found in the retina's specialized light receptor cells (photoreceptors). Researchers suspect that this isoform may help maintain photoreceptors by regulating the function of cilia. Other isoforms of the RPGR protein are expressed in other parts of the body, where they are probably also involved in cilia function.","Retinitis pigmentosa More than 300 mutations in the RPGR gene have been found to cause the X-linked form of retinitis pigmentosa. This condition primarily affects males, causing night blindness in early childhood followed by progressive daytime vision loss. RPGR gene mutations account for about 70 percent of all cases of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa.Most of the mutations responsible for X-linked retinitis pigmentosa occur in the ORF15 exon of the RPGR protein. These mutations usually result in an abnormally short, malfunctioning protein. Changes in the structure of the RPGR protein likely disrupt the normal function of cilia in photoreceptor cells. However, it is unclear how these changes lead to the gradual loss of photoreceptors and resulting vision problems that are characteristic of retinitis pigmentosa. "
1136,RPL5 ,ribosomal protein L5,"The RPL5 gene provides instructions for making one of approximately 80 different ribosomal proteins, which are components of cellular structures called ribosomes. Ribosomes process the cell's genetic instructions to create proteins.Each ribosome is made up of two parts (subunits) called the large and small subunits. The protein produced from the RPL5 gene is among those found in the large subunit.The specific functions of the RPL5 protein and the other ribosomal proteins within these subunits are unclear. Some ribosomal proteins are involved in the assembly or stability of ribosomes. Others help carry out the ribosome's main function of building new proteins. Studies suggest that some ribosomal proteins may have other functions, such as participating in chemical signaling pathways within the cell, regulating cell division, and controlling the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).Research suggests that the protein produced from the RPL5 gene also normally has tumor suppressor function, which means that it helps keep cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.","Diamond-Blackfan anemia More than 70 RPL5 gene mutations have been identified in individuals with Diamond-Blackfan anemia. This disorder primarily affects the bone marrow, which produces new blood cells. People with this condition often also have physical abnormalities affecting various parts of the body.The RPL5 gene mutations that cause Diamond-Blackfan anemia are either inherited or occur early in development before birth, and occur in every cell in the body. The mutations are believed to cause problems with ribosomal function. Studies indicate that a shortage of functioning ribosomes may increase apoptosis of blood-forming cells in the bone marrow, resulting in a low number of red blood cells (anemia). Abnormal regulation of cell division or inappropriate triggering of apoptosis may contribute to the other health problems and unusual physical features that affect some people with Diamond-Blackfan anemia.

"
1139,RPS6KA3 ,ribosomal protein S6 kinase A3,"The RPS6KA3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of a family called ribosomal S6 kinases (RSKs). These proteins help regulate the activity of certain genes and are involved in signaling within cells. RSK proteins are thought to play a role in several important cellular processes including cell growth and division (proliferation), cell specialization (differentiation), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).The protein made by the RPS6KA3 gene appears to play an important role in the brain. The protein is involved in cell signaling pathways that are required for learning, the formation of long-term memories, and the survival of nerve cells.","Coffin-Lowry syndrome More than 125 mutations in the RPS6KA3 gene have been identified in people with Coffin-Lowry syndrome, a condition associated with intellectual disability and skeletal abnormalities. All of these mutations severely reduce or eliminate the activity of the RPS6KA3 protein. Some mutations insert or delete genetic material in the gene or change how the gene's instructions are used to build the protein. Other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the RPS6KA3 protein.Researchers do not fully understand how mutations in the RPS6KA3 gene lead to the signs and symptoms of Coffin-Lowry syndrome. A functional RPS6KA3 protein appears to be important for learning and memory, but its role in the skeleton is unknown. "

Studies suggest that some ribosomal proteins may have other functions, such as participating in chemical signaling pathways within the cell, regulating cell division, and controlling the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).","5q minus syndrome The RPS14 gene is involved in a condition called 5q minus (5q-) syndrome. This condition is a type of bone marrow disorder called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with 5q- syndrome often have a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) and abnormalities in blood cells called megakaryocytes, which produce platelets, the cells involved in blood clotting. Affected individuals also have an increased risk of developing a fast-growing blood cancer known as acute myeloid leukemia (AML).5q- syndrome is caused by deletion of a region of DNA from the long (q) arm of chromosome 5. This deletion occurs in immature blood cells during a person's lifetime and affects one copy of chromosome 5 in each cell. Most people with 5q- syndrome are missing a sequence of about 1.5 million DNA building blocks (base pairs), also written as 1.5 megabases (Mb). This region of DNA contains 40 genes, including RPS14. Loss of one copy of the RPS14 gene reduces the amount of RPS14 protein that is made. Studies indicate that a shortage of functioning ribosomal proteins increases the self-destruction of blood-forming cells in the bone marrow, resulting in anemia. Research suggests that the other features of the condition are associated with other genes in the deleted segment of DNA. "

"
1146,RPSA ,ribosomal protein SA,"The RPSA gene provides instructions for making a protein called ribosomal protein SA, which is one of approximately 80 different ribosomal proteins. These proteins come together to form structures called ribosomes. Ribosomes process the cell's genetic instructions to create proteins.Each ribosome is made up of two parts (subunits) called the large subunit and the small subunit. Ribosomal protein SA is part of the small subunit.The specific roles of each of the ribosomal proteins within the ribosome are not entirely understood. Some ribosomal proteins are involved in the assembly or stability of ribosomes. Others help carry out the ribosome's main function of building new proteins. Research suggests that ribosomal protein SA helps the ribosome control the production of certain proteins, many of which are likely important for development before birth.","Isolated congenital asplenia At least 20 RPSA gene mutations have been identified in individuals with isolated congenital asplenia. People with this condition do not have a spleen but have no other developmental abnormalities. The spleen plays an important role in the immune system. Without this organ, affected individuals are highly susceptible to bacterial infections, which can be life-threatening.RPSA gene mutations are thought to reduce the amount of functional ribosomal protein SA. A shortage of the normal protein likely impairs the assembly of ribosomes, but the specific effects of the mutations are not known. It is unclear why RPSA gene mutations solely affect the development of the spleen. "
1147,RRM2B ,ribonucleotide reductase regulatory TP53 inducible subunit M2B,"The RRM2B gene provides instructions for making one piece, called the p53 inducible small subunit (p53R2), of a protein called ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). Two copies of the p53R2 subunit are attached to two copies of another protein called R1 to form RNR. (R1 can also attach to another small subunit, called R2, to make another form of RNR). Whether made with p53R2 or R2, RNR helps produce DNA building blocks (nucleotides), which are joined to one another in a particular order to form DNA.RNRs containing p53R2 make nucleotides that are used for the formation of DNA in specialized cell structures called mitochondria. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the cell's nucleus (nuclear DNA), mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA (mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA). Mitochondria are the energy-producing centers in cells, and the DNA in these structures contains genes essential for the process of energy production (called oxidative phosphorylation). The production of nucleotides by p53R2 also helps maintain a normal amount of mtDNA in cells.","Progressive external ophthalmoplegia At least 17 mutations in the RRM2B gene have been identified in people with an eye condition called progressive external ophthalmoplegia. This disorder weakens the muscles that control eye movement and causes the eyelids to droop (ptosis). Some affected individuals have additional signs and symptoms, such as weakness of other muscles, extreme tiredness (fatigue), hearing loss caused by problems with the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss), and digestive problems.Typically, mutations that cause progressive external ophthalmoplegia occur in one copy of the RRM2B gene, although rarely both copies of the gene are altered. RRM2B gene mutations associated with progressive external ophthalmoplegia lead to impaired RNR activity. These mutations result in large deletions of genetic material from mtDNA in muscle tissue, possibly because impairment of RNR activity leads to a shortage of nucleotides, although the mechanism is unclear. Researchers have not determined how deletions of mtDNA lead to the specific signs and symptoms of progressive external ophthalmoplegia, although the features of the condition may be related to impaired oxidative phosphorylation. It has been suggested that eye muscles are commonly affected by mitochondrial defects because they are especially dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for energy. "
1148,RS1 ,retinoschisin 1,"The RS1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called retinoschisin, which is found in the retina. The retina is a specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. Retinoschisin attaches (binds) to the surface of specialized cells within the retina that detect light and color (photoreceptor cells). The protein also binds to bipolar cells, which relay light signals from photoreceptor cells to other retinal cells. Studies suggest that retinoschisin plays a role in the development and maintenance of the retina and its specialized cells. Retinoschisin is likely involved in the organization of cells in the retina by attaching cells together (cell adhesion).","X-linked juvenile retinoschisis More than 220 mutations in the RS1 gene have been found to cause X-linked juvenile retinoschisis. This disorder causes tiny splits (schisis) or tears to form in the retina, which results in progressive vision loss in males. Most of the RS1 gene mutations change one protein building block (amino acid) in the retinoschisin protein, although many different types of mutations have been identified. Research suggests that the various mutations in the RS1 gene can alter the 3-dimensional structure of the protein, impair the protein's ability to attach cells together (cell adhesion), cause misplacement of the protein within retinal cells, or prevent protein production. Changes in the retinoschisin protein function or production disrupt its role in the maintenance and organization of the retina. As a result, splitting or tearing of the retina can occur, causing the vision problems associated with X-linked juvenile retinoschisis. "
1149,RSPO4 ,R-spondin 4,"The RSPO4 gene provides instructions for making a protein called R-spondin-4. R-spondin-4 plays a role in the Wnt signaling pathway, a series of steps that affect the way cells and tissues develop. Wnt signaling is important for cell division, attachment of cells to one another (adhesion), cell movement (migration), and many other cellular activities. The role of R-spondin-4 is to increase Wnt signaling.During early development, Wnt signaling plays a critical role in the growth and development of nails. R-spondin-4 is active in the skeleton and contributes to limb formation, particularly at the ends of the fingers and toes, where nail development occurs.Different regions (domains) of R-spondin-4 have different functions; two regions known as furin-like domains are required for turning on (activating) and stabilizing proteins that play integral roles in the Wnt pathway.","Anonychia congenita At least 17 mutations in the RSPO4 gene have been found to cause anonychia congenita. This condition is characterized by the absence of fingernails and toenails (anonychia) from birth. Nearly all of the RSPO4 gene mutations that cause this condition affect the furin-like domains, impairing protein function. Some mutations disrupt the structure of the furin-like domains, and others lead to the production of an abnormally short protein that does not contain these domains. As a result, R-spondin-4 cannot participate in the Wnt signaling pathway and nails develop improperly or not at all. "
1150,RUNX1 ,runt related transcription factor 1,"The RUNX1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1). Like other transcription factors, the RUNX1 protein attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. This protein interacts with another protein called core binding factor beta or CBFβ (produced from the CBFB gene), which helps RUNX1 bind to DNA and prevents it from being broken down. Together, these proteins form one version of a complex known as core binding factor (CBF). The RUNX1 protein turns on (activates) genes that help control the development of blood cells (hematopoiesis). In particular, it plays an important role in development of hematopoietic stem cells, early blood cells that have the potential to develop into all types of mature blood cells such as white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.","Core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia A rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material involving the RUNX1 gene is found in approximately 7 percent of individuals with a form of blood cancer known as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The translocation, written as t(8;21), combines genetic information from chromosome 21 and chromosome 8, fusing the RUNX1 gene on chromosome 21 with a gene on chromosome 8 called RUNX1T1 (also known as ETO). Because this genetic change affects CBF, the condition is classified as core binding factor AML (CBF-AML).The resulting fusion protein, RUNX1-ETO, is able to form CBF and attach to DNA, like the normal RUNX1 protein; however, instead of turning genes on, it turns them off. This change in gene activity blocks the maturation (differentiation) of blood cells and leads to the production of abnormal, immature white blood cells called myeloid blasts. While t(8;21) is important for leukemia development, a mutation in one or more additional genes is typically needed for the myeloid blasts to develop into cancerous leukemia cells. "
1151,RUNX1T1 ,RUNX1 translocation partner 1,"The RUNX1T1 gene provides instructions for making a protein commonly referred to as ETO, which helps regulate the activity of genes. ETO is considered a transcriptional corepressor because it turns off (represses) gene activity. It performs this function by attaching (binding) to proteins that normally turn genes on and blocking their activity. It also interacts with other corepressors to help keep genes turned off.","Core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia A rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material involving the RUNX1T1 gene is found in approximately 7 percent of individuals with a form of blood cancer known as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This translocation, written as t(8;21), combines genetic information from chromosome 8 and chromosome 21, fusing a gene called RUNX1 on chromosome 21 with the RUNX1T1 gene on chromosome 8. When associated with this translocation, the condition is classified as core binding factor AML (CBF-AML).The protein produced from the normal RUNX1 gene is part of a protein complex known as core binding factor (CBF). As part of CBF, the RUNX1 protein attaches to specific areas of DNA and turns on (activates) genes that are involved in the development of blood cells. Like RUNX1, the fusion protein produced from the t(8;21) translocation, called RUNX1-ETO, attaches to DNA; however, because ETO is involved, the fusion protein turns off genes related to blood cell development instead of turning them on. This change in gene activity blocks the maturation (differentiation) of blood cells and leads to the production of abnormal, immature white blood cells called myeloid blasts. While t(8;21) is important for leukemia development, one or more additional genetic changes are typically needed for the myeloid blasts to develop into cancerous leukemia cells. "
1152,RUNX2 ,runt related transcription factor 2,"The RUNX2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development and maintenance of the teeth, bones, and cartilage. Cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone (a process called ossification), except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose, airways, and external ears.The RUNX2 protein is a transcription factor, which means it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. Researchers believe that the RUNX2 protein acts as a ""master switch,"" regulating a number of other genes involved in the development of cells that build bones (osteoblasts) and in the development of teeth.","Cleidocranial dysplasia About 200 mutations in the RUNX2 gene have been identified in individuals with cleidocranial dysplasia, a condition that primarily affects development of the bones and teeth. Some mutations change one protein building block (amino acid) in the RUNX2 protein. Other mutations introduce a premature stop signal that results in an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein. Occasionally, the entire gene is missing.These genetic changes reduce or eliminate the activity of the protein produced from one copy of the RUNX2 gene in each cell, decreasing the total amount of functional RUNX2 protein. This shortage of functional RUNX2 protein interferes with the normal development of bones, cartilage, and teeth, resulting in the signs and symptoms of cleidocranial dysplasia. In rare cases, individuals with a deletion of genetic material that includes RUNX2 and other nearby genes may experience additional features, such as developmental delay, resulting from the loss of these genes. "
1153,RYR1 ,ryanodine receptor 1,"The RYR1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ryanodine receptor 1. This protein is part of a family of ryanodine receptors, which form channels that transport positively charged calcium atoms (ions) within cells. Channels made with the ryanodine receptor 1 protein play a critical role in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles).For the body to move normally, skeletal muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. Muscle contractions are triggered by the flow of positively charged ions, including calcium, into muscle cells.When muscles are at rest, calcium ions are stored in a cellular structure called the sarcoplasmic reticulum inside each muscle cell. In response to certain signals, the RYR1 channel releases calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the surrounding cell fluid (cytoplasm). The resulting increase in calcium ion concentration stimulates muscle fibers to contract, allowing the body to move. The process by which certain chemical signals trigger muscle contraction is called excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling.","Central core disease More than 90 mutations in the RYR1 gene have been identified in people with central core disease (CCD). Most of these mutations affect single protein building blocks (amino acids) in critical regions of the ryanodine receptor 1 protein. These mutations change the structure of the RYR1 channel, which alters the normal flow of stored calcium ions within muscle cells. A disruption in calcium ion release prevents muscles from contracting normally, leading to the muscle weakness characteristic of central core disease.Researchers have proposed two mechanisms to explain how RYR1 gene mutations underlie muscle weakness in people with central core disease. Some genetic changes cause the RYR1 channel to be ""leaky,"" allowing calcium ions to flow slowly but continually out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The leaky channels greatly reduce the amount of stored calcium ions. As a result, not enough calcium ions are available in the sarcoplasmic reticulum to trigger muscle contractions. Muscle weakness results from the inability of skeletal muscles to contract appropriately.Other RYR1 gene mutations change the structure of the RYR1 channel in a way that impedes the normal flow of calcium ions. Although the sarcoplasmic reticulum stores plenty of these ions, the receptor cannot release them in response to the usual signals. Without enough calcium ions flowing out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum at the appropriate time, muscles cannot contract normally and muscle weakness results. This mechanism is known as E-C uncoupling. "
1154,RYR2 ,ryanodine receptor 2,"The RYR2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ryanodine receptor 2. This protein is part of a family of ryanodine receptors, which form channels that transport positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) within cells.Channels made with the ryanodine receptor 2 protein are found in heart (cardiac) muscle cells called myocytes. These channels are embedded in the outer membrane of a cell structure called the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which acts as a storage center for calcium ions. The RYR2 channel controls the flow of calcium ions out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.For the heart to beat normally, the cardiac muscle must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. This cycle of muscle contraction and relaxation results from the precise control of calcium ions within myocytes. In response to certain signals, the RYR2 channel releases calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the surrounding cell fluid (the cytoplasm). The resulting increase in calcium ion concentration triggers the cardiac muscle to contract, which pumps blood out of the heart. Calcium ions are then transported back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and the cardiac muscle relaxes. In this way, the release and reuptake of calcium ions in myocytes produces a regular heart rhythm.","Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia More than 70 mutations in the RYR2 gene have been found to cause catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). Almost all of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ryanodine receptor 2 protein. These mutations alter the structure and function of the RYR2 channel.Researchers are uncertain how RYR2 gene mutations lead to ventricular tachycardia, the abnormally fast and irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia) that is characteristic of CPVT. Some studies have suggested that mutations interfere with the regulation of the RYR2 channel. Other studies have found that the altered RYR2 channel stays open abnormally, allowing calcium ions to ""leak"" out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It is clear that changes in the structure and function of the RYR2 channel disrupt the careful control of calcium ion flow in myocytes, which can trigger an abnormal heart rhythm in people with CPVT. "
1155,SAA1 ,serum amyloid A1,"The SAA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called serum amyloid A1. This protein is made primarily in the liver and circulates in low levels in the blood. Although its function is not fully understood, serum amyloid A1 appears to play a role in the immune system. Serum amyloid A1 may help repair damaged tissues, act as an antibacterial agent, and signal the migration of germ-fighting cells to sites of infection.Levels of this protein increase in the blood and other tissues under conditions of inflammation. Inflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair. When this has been accomplished, the body stops the inflammatory response to prevent damage to its own cells and tissues.There are three versions of the serum amyloid A1 protein, known as alpha, beta, and gamma, which differ by one or two protein building blocks (amino acids). The frequency of these variants differs across populations. In white populations, the alpha version predominates and gamma is rare. In the Japanese population, however, the three versions appear almost equally.","Familial Mediterranean fever Several studies of people with familial Mediterranean fever indicate that having the alpha version of the serum amyloid A1 protein increases the risk of a serious complication called amyloidosis. Amyloidosis involves the buildup of protein deposits that can lead to kidney failure if left untreated. Studies indicate that individuals with familial Mediterranean fever who also have the alpha version of the protein are two to seven times more likely to develop amyloidosis than are people with the beta or gamma version.More serum amyloid A1 is produced in the body during episodes of inflammation such as those that occur in familial Mediterranean fever. This protein and related compounds may form abnormal clumps in the body's organs and tissues. It remains unclear, however, how the alpha version of serum amyloid A1 increases the susceptibility to amyloidosis (or alternatively, how the beta and gamma versions may protect against this complication) in people with this disorder. "
1156,SACS ,sacsin molecular chaperone,"The SACS gene provides instructions for producing a protein called sacsin. Sacsin is found in the brain, skin cells, muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles), and at low levels in the pancreas, but the specific function of the protein is unknown. Research suggests that sacsin plays a role in organizing proteins into bundles called intermediate filaments. Intermediate filaments provide support and strength to cells. In nerve cells (neurons), specialized intermediate filaments called neurofilaments comprise the structural framework that establishes the size and shape of nerve cell extensions called axons, which are essential for transmission of nerve impulses to other neurons and to muscle cells.","Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay About 200 mutations in the SACS gene have been found to cause autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay, commonly called ARSACS. ARSACS is a condition affecting muscle movement that is characterized by abnormal tensing of the muscles (spasticity), problems with balance and coordination (cerebellar ataxia), and reduced sensation and weakness in the arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy).Two SACS gene mutations have been found frequently in people with ARSACS from the Charlevoix-Saguenay region of Quebec, Canada. One of these mutations deletes a DNA building block (nucleotide) called thymine at position 6594 in the SACS gene (written as 6594delT). This mutation is found in more than 90 percent of people with ARSACS in Quebec. The other mutation replaces the nucleotide cytosine with the nucleotide thymine at position 5254 in the SACS gene (written as C5254T). Both of these mutations lead to production of a sacsin protein that is abnormally short and nonfunctional.Mutations causing ARSACS in people outside of Quebec are varied and usually unique to that person or family. Most of these mutations either delete one or more nucleotides or replace one nucleotide with another nucleotide in the SACS gene. Mutations in the SACS gene result in the production of an unstable sacsin protein that does not function normally. It is unclear how the abnormal sacsin protein affects the brain and skeletal muscles but it likely impairs normal organization of intermediate filaments in cells, particularly neurofilaments, and disrupts neuron function. This decreased neuronal signaling may result in the signs and symptoms of ARSACS. "
1157,SALL1 ,spalt like transcription factor 1,"The SALL1 gene is part of a group of genes called the SALL family. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are involved in the formation of tissues and organs during embryonic development. SALL proteins are transcription factors, which means they attach (bind) to specific regions of DNA and help control the activity of particular genes.The exact function of the SALL1 protein is unclear. This protein is made in many tissues, including the kidneys, liver, and fetal and adult brain. Based on the effects of SALL1 mutations, researchers infer that this protein plays an important role in development of the hands (particularly the thumbs), ears, anus, kidneys, and other parts of the body before birth.","Townes-Brocks Syndrome More than 55 mutations in the SALL1 gene have been identified in people with Townes-Brocks syndrome. Researchers originally believed that all of these mutations prevented one copy of the gene in each cell from making any protein, resulting in a shortage of SALL1 protein during development. More recently, they found that some mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small version of the SALL1 protein that malfunctions within cells. The malfunctioning protein interferes with normal copies of the SALL1 protein, preventing them from entering the nucleus to regulate gene activity. Scientists suspect that this type of genetic change likely underlies the more severe cases of Townes-Brocks syndrome. Mutations that reduce the amount of SALL1 protein are probably responsible for milder cases of this condition.The SALL1 gene appears to be necessary for the normal development of many different organs and tissues before birth, which helps explain why mutations in this gene can cause the varied birth defects associated with Townes-Brocks syndrome. It is uncertain, however, how SALL1 mutations result in the specific features of this condition including an obstruction of the anal opening (imperforate anus), abnormally shaped ears, and hand malformations. "
1158,SALL4 ,spalt like transcription factor 4,"The SALL4 gene is part of a group of genes called the SALL family. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are involved in the formation of tissues and organs during embryonic development. SALL proteins are transcription factors, which means they attach (bind) to specific regions of DNA and help control the activity of particular genes.The exact function of the SALL4 protein remains unclear. Based on the functions of similar proteins in other organisms (such as zebrafish and mice), the SALL4 protein appears to play a critical role in the developing limbs. This protein may also be important for the development of nerves that control eye movement and for the formation of the walls (septa) that divide the heart into separate chambers.","Duane-radial ray syndrome More than 25 mutations in the SALL4 gene have been identified in people with Duane-radial ray syndrome (also known as Okihiro syndrome) or a very similar condition called acro-renal-ocular syndrome. Researchers suspect that Duane-radial ray syndrome and acro-renal-ocular syndrome are part of an overlapping set of syndromes with many possible signs and symptoms.Most SALL4 gene mutations create a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the SALL4 protein. As a result, cells do not produce any functional protein from one copy of this gene. Researchers are investigating how a reduction in the amount of the SALL4 protein disrupts eye, heart, and limb development in people with Duane-radial ray syndrome and acro-renal-ocular syndrome. "
1159,SAMD9L ,sterile alpha motif domain containing 9 like,"The SAMD9L gene provides instructions for making a protein that is active in cells throughout the body. The protein is involved in regulating the growth and division (proliferation) and maturation (differentiation) of cells, particularly cells in the bone marrow that give rise to blood cells. Studies suggest that the SAMD9L protein acts as a tumor suppressor, keeping cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. The SAMD9L protein also appears to play an important role in the brain, particularly the part of the brain that coordinates movement (the cerebellum), although less is known about the protein's function there.","Ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome At least four inherited mutations in the SAMD9L gene have been found to cause ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome, a rare condition that affects the cerebellum and blood-forming cells in the bone marrow. This condition causes neurological problems such as ataxia, which is difficulty with balance and coordination. It is also associated with pancytopenia, which is a reduced number of blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. People with ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome have an increased risk of certain cancerous conditions of the blood, particularly myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia.The mutations that cause ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome are present in essentially all of the body's cells. They are described as ""gain-of-function."" They increase the SAMD9L protein's ability to block cell growth and division. In the bone marrow, the resulting reduction in cell proliferation leads to a shortage of blood cells. It is unclear how the effects of these mutations are related to ataxia and the other neurological problems associated with ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome.It seems paradoxical that gain-of-function mutations in the SAMD9L gene, which enhance the protein's tumor suppressor function, could increase the risk of developing cancerous conditions such as myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. It appears that certain cells in the bone marrow with an inherited gain-of-function SAMD9L gene mutation can develop additional genetic changes that are associated with milder pancytopenia but an increased cancer risk. These changes include mutations that disable the SAMD9L gene (""loss-of-function"" mutations) or a deletion of part of the long (q) arm of chromosome 7 that contains the SAMD9L gene. These additional changes compensate for the effects of the gain-of-function mutation in bone marrow cells. They prevent an overactive SAMD9L protein from excessively restricting cell proliferation, which reduces the severity of pancytopenia in affected individuals. However, a loss of the SAMD9L gene and other genes on the long arm of chromosome 7 may allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably, leading to cancer. A deletion of the long arm of chromosome 7 is a well-known risk factor for myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia. "
1160,SAMHD1 ,SAM and HD domain containing deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase 1,"The SAMHD1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that helps cut (cleave) molecules called deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) into their deoxynucleoside and triphosphate components. The dNTP molecules are needed for the replication and maintenance of the genetic material (DNA) in the body's cells, and the amount of available dNTPs must be tightly controlled for these functions to proceed normally. Invading viruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) also need dNTPs in order to replicate themselves. The SAMHD1 enzyme helps regulate the amount of available dNTPs to both meet the needs of the body's cells and control viral infections.","Aicardi-Goutières syndrome At least 78 mutations in the SAMHD1 gene have been identified in people with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, a disorder that involves severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), skin lesions, and other health problems. Research suggests that mutations in this gene may lead to production of a SAMHD1 protein that does not properly regulate the amount of available dNTPs. As a result, DNA maintenance is impaired, allowing DNA damage to accumulate in cells. Research suggests that this DNA damage may lead to cell signaling that inappropriately activates an immune response. As a result, the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs, causing inflammatory damage to the brain, skin, and other body systems that lead to the characteristic features of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. "
1161,SAR1B ,secretion associated Ras related GTPase 1B,"The SAR1B gene provides instructions for making a protein that is produced in a variety of tissues. Most research involving the SAR1B protein has studied its role in the digestive tract.The SAR1B protein is needed for the transport of molecules called chylomicrons. During digestion, chylomicrons are formed within cells called enterocytes that line the small intestine and absorb nutrients. Chylomicrons are needed to absorb fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins K, E, and D) and carry fats and cholesterol from the small intestine into the bloodstream.Within enterocytes, SAR1B proteins help transport immature chylomicrons from a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum to another cell structure called the Golgi apparatus. Immature chylomicrons are processed within the Golgi apparatus, resulting in mature chylomicrons. These mature chylomicrons are then released from enterocytes into the bloodstream so the body can use the fats and fat-soluble vitamins they carry. Sufficient levels of fats, cholesterol, and vitamins are necessary for normal growth and development.In other tissues, such as the heart and other muscles, the SAR1B protein is likely involved in transporting calcium within cells.","Chylomicron retention disease More than 20 mutations in the SAR1B gene have been found to cause chylomicron retention disease. This is an inherited disorder that impairs the normal absorption of fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins from food. Most of the mutations change one protein building block (amino acid) in the SAR1B protein. Other mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small version of the protein that cannot function properly.SAR1B gene mutations disrupt the SAR1B protein's ability to transport immature chylomicrons from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. As a result, mature chylomicrons are not released into the bloodstream. Impaired chylomicron transport causes severely decreased absorption (malabsorption) of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins, leading to nutritional and developmental problems in people with chylomicron retention disease. "
1162,SATB2 ,SATB homeobox 2,"The SATB2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control the development of certain body systems. The SATB2 protein attaches to special regions of DNA called matrix attachment regions (MARs). These regions help determine the structure of chromatin, which is the complex of DNA and proteins that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin is one way that gene expression is regulated during development.By organizing chromatin structure, the SATB2 protein coordinates the activity of multiple genes involved in the development of certain body systems. In particular, the SATB2 protein promotes the maturation of cells that build bones (osteoblasts) and directs development of structures in the head and face. The protein also plays roles in the maturation and function of different types of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain.","SATB2-associated syndrome Mutations in the SATB2 gene have been found to cause SATB2-associated syndrome. Individuals with this condition have intellectual disability and severe speech problems. They may also have an opening in the roof of the mouth, dental abnormalities, or other abnormalities of the head and face (craniofacial anomalies). Some of these mutations are deletions of large pieces of DNA that remove several genes, including SATB2. Other mutations add, remove, or rearrange smaller pieces of DNA within the SATB2 gene. Still other mutations change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the SATB2 gene. It is likely that these genetic changes reduce the amount of functional SATB2 protein. Reduction of SATB2 function is thought to impair normal development of the brain and craniofacial structures, leading to intellectual disability, delayed speech, craniofacial anomalies, and other features of SATB2-associated syndrome.The signs and symptoms of SATB2-associated syndrome are usually similar, regardless of the type of mutation that causes it. However, some individuals with large deletions that include additional genes have uncommon features of the condition, such as problems with the heart, genitals and urinary tract (genitourinary tract), skin, or hair. These features are thought to be related to loss of other genes near SATB2. "
1163,SBDS ,"SBDS, ribosome maturation factor","The SBDS gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. Because mutations in this gene cause health problems affecting many body systems, researchers believe that the SBDS protein has an essential function in cells throughout the body.Studies suggest that the SBDS protein may play a role in processing RNA, a molecule that is a chemical cousin of DNA. This protein may also be involved in building ribosomes, which are cellular structures that use the instructions encoded by RNA to create proteins. More research is needed to clarify the protein's role in these processes.","Shwachman-Diamond syndrome At least 20 mutations in the SBDS gene have been identified in people with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. Most of these mutations result from an exchange of genetic material between the SBDS gene and a very similar, but nonfunctional, piece of DNA called a pseudogene, which is located very close to the SBDS gene on chromosome 7. This type of DNA exchange is called a gene conversion. The genetic material from the pseudogene contains errors that, when introduced into the SBDS gene, disrupt the way the gene's instructions are used to make a protein.The two most common mutations in people with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome result from exchanges between the SBDS gene and the nearby pseudogene. One of these mutations, written as 258+2T>C, changes a single DNA building block (nucleotide) in a region of the gene known as intron 2. This mutation, which is called a splice-site mutation, prevents the production of any functional SBDS protein. The other common mutation, written as 183-184TA>CT, changes two nucleotides in the SBDS gene. This genetic change introduces a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the SBDS protein. It is unclear whether this mutation results in an abnormally shortened protein or prevents any protein from being made.The features of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome result when mutations impair the normal function of the SBDS protein. Because the protein's function is unknown, researchers have not determined how these mutations underlie the bone marrow abnormalities, increased cancer risk, and other signs and symptoms of this condition. "
1164,SCARB2 ,scavenger receptor class B member 2,"The SCARB2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called lysosomal integral membrane protein-2 (LIMP-2). As its name suggests, this protein is primarily found in the membrane of cellular structures called lysosomes, which are specialized compartments that digest and recycle materials. Before moving to the lysosome, the LIMP-2 protein is processed in a cellular structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. There, LIMP-2 attaches to an enzyme called beta-glucocerebrosidase and transports it to the lysosome. In lysosomes, beta-glucocerebrosidase breaks down a fatty substance called glucocerebroside. The LIMP-2 protein remains in the lysosomal membrane after transporting beta-glucocerebrosidase and is important for the stability of these structures.The LIMP-2 protein has additional functions outside the lysosome. In the heart, the protein is found in regions known as intercalated discs, which connect individual heart muscle cells together to form strong fibers. The LIMP-2 protein appears to play a role when the heart muscle is abnormally enlarged and has to work harder than normal, although its exact function is not clear.The LIMP-2 protein is sometimes found in the outer membrane that surrounds the cell. Certain viruses can attach to LIMP-2, which allows them to enter and infect the cell. In particular, enterovirus 71 and certain strains of coxsackievirus (A7, A14, and A16), which cause a viral infection known as hand, foot, and mouth disease, use the LIMP-2 protein.","Action myoclonus–renal failure syndrome At least 20 mutations in the SCARB2 gene have been associated with action myoclonus–renal failure (AMRF) syndrome. This rare condition causes episodes of involuntary muscle jerking or twitching, particularly when trying to make intentional movements (action myoclonus). Another common feature of AMRF syndrome is kidney (renal) disease; despite being referenced in the condition name, kidney function is not affected in every person with the condition.SCARB2 gene mutations associated with AMRF syndrome lead to production of an altered LIMP-2 protein that is stuck in the endoplasmic reticulum and cannot get to the lysosome. As a result, the movement of beta-glucocerebrosidase to lysosomes is impaired. It is thought that a shortage of beta-glucocerebrosidase in these structures contributes to the signs and symptoms of AMRF syndrome, although the mechanism is unclear. Researchers are working to understand why some people with SCARB2 gene mutations have kidney problems and others do not. "
1165,SCN1A ,sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 1,"The SCN1A gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making sodium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged sodium atoms (sodium ions) into cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.The SCN1A gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha subunit) of a sodium channel called NaV1.1. These channels are primarily found in the brain, where they control the flow of sodium ions into cells. NaV1.1 channels are involved in transmitting signals from one nerve cell (neuron) to another. Communication between neurons depends on chemicals called neurotransmitters, which are released from one neuron and taken up by neighboring neurons. The flow of sodium ions through NaV1.1 channels helps determine when neurotransmitters will be released.","Familial hemiplegic migraine At least seven mutations in the SCN1A gene have been identified in people with familial hemiplegic migraine type 3 (FHM3), a form of migraine headache that runs in families. Each of these mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the NaV1.1 channel, which alters the channel's structure. The abnormal channels stay open longer than usual, which increases the flow of sodium ions into neurons. This increase triggers the cell to release more neurotransmitters. The resulting changes in signaling between neurons make people with FHM3 more susceptible to developing these severe headaches. "
1166,SCN4A ,sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 4,"The SCN4A gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making sodium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged sodium atoms (sodium ions) into cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.The SCN4A gene provides instructions for making a critical part (the alpha subunit) of sodium channels that are abundant in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For the body to move normally, these muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. One of the changes that helps trigger muscle contractions is the flow of positively charged atoms (ions), including sodium, into muscle cells. Channels made with the SCN4A protein control the flow of sodium ions into these cells.","Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis More than 10 mutations in the SCN4A gene have been found to cause hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, a condition that causes episodes of extreme muscle weakness that are often associated with high levels of potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia).The mutations change single building blocks (amino acids) in the SCN4A protein, which alters the structure and function of sodium channels in skeletal muscle cells. These changes delay the closing of channels made with the SCN4A protein or prevent the channels from staying closed. As a result, sodium ions continue flowing into muscle cells abnormally. This increase in sodium ions triggers the release of potassium from muscle cells, which causes more sodium channels to open and stimulates the flow of even more sodium ions into these cells. These changes in ion transport reduce the ability of skeletal muscles to contract, leading to episodes of muscle weakness or paralysis. "
1167,SCN5A ,sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 5,"The SCN5A gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making sodium channels. These channels open and close at specific times to control the flow of positively charged sodium atoms (sodium ions) into cells. The sodium channels containing proteins produced from the SCN5A gene are abundant in heart (cardiac) muscle cells and play key roles in these cells' ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. These channels play a major role in signaling the start of each heartbeat, coordinating the contractions of the upper and lower chambers of the heart, and maintaining a normal heart rhythm.","Brugada syndrome More than 400 mutations in the SCN5A gene have been identified in people with Brugada syndrome, which is a heart condition characterized by an irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia). SCN5A gene mutations also cause sudden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome (SUNDS), which was originally described in Southeast Asian populations. Researchers have since determined that SUNDS and Brugada syndrome are the same disorder.Some SCN5A gene mutations associated with Brugada syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SCN5A protein. These mutations alter the structure of ion channels made with the SCN5A protein and disrupt the flow of sodium ions into cardiac muscle cells. Other mutations prevent the SCN5A gene from producing any functional ion channels, which also reduces the inward flow of sodium ions. A disruption in ion transport changes the way the heart beats, leading to the arrhythmia often found in Brugada syndrome and SUNDS. "
1168,SCN8A ,sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 8,"The SCN8A gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making sodium channels. These channels allow positively charged sodium (Na) atoms (sodium ions) to pass into cells; they play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.The SCN8A gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha subunit) of a sodium channel called Nav1.6. The alpha subunit forms the hole (pore) in the cell membrane through which sodium ions flow. Nav1.6 channels are primarily found in the nerve cells (neurons) of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) and neurons that connect the central nervous system to muscles and sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and sound (the peripheral nervous system). Nav1.6 channels control the flow of sodium ions into cells, which makes it possible for neurons to communicate by generating and transmitting electrical signals.","SCN8A-related epilepsy with encephalopathy More than 100 mutations in the SCN8A gene have been found to cause SCN8A-related epilepsy with encephalopathy. This condition is characterized by recurrent seizures (epilepsy), abnormal brain function (encephalopathy), and intellectual disability. The signs and symptoms of this condition typically begin in infancy.Most of these SCN8A gene mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the Nav1.6 channel. The mutations that cause SCN8A-related epilepsy with encephalopathy result in altered channels that stay open longer than usual, which increases the flow of sodium ions into neurons. The persistently open channels abnormally increase electrical signals, which can lead to excess activation (excitation) of neurons in the brain. This increased neuronal activity leads to seizures in people with SCN8A-related epilepsy with encephalopathy.It is unknown how SCN8A gene mutations lead to intellectual disability, movement problems, and the other features of SCN8A-related epilepsy with encephalopathy. Because some affected children experience the loss of previously acquired skills (developmental regression) after the onset of seizures, it has been suggested that the seizures may impair brain function, but it is unclear if that is the case. "
1169,SCN9A ,sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 9,"The SCN9A gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making sodium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged sodium atoms (sodium ions) into cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.The SCN9A gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha subunit) of a sodium channel called NaV1.7. NaV1.7 sodium channels are found in nerve cells called nociceptors that transmit pain signals. Nociceptors are part of the peripheral nervous system, which connects the brain and spinal cord to cells that detect sensations such as touch, smell, and pain. Nociceptors are primarily involved in transmitting pain signals. The centers of nociceptors, known as the cell bodies, are located in a part of the spinal cord called the dorsal root ganglion. Fibers called axons extend from the cell bodies, reaching throughout the body to receive sensory information. Axons transmit the information back to the dorsal root ganglion, which then sends it to the brain. NaV1.7 sodium channels are also found in olfactory sensory neurons, which are nerve cells in the nasal cavity that transmit smell-related signals to the brain.","Congenital insensitivity to pain At least 13 mutations in the SCN9A gene have been found to cause congenital insensitivity to pain, a condition that inhibits the ability to perceive physical pain. The SCN9A gene mutations that cause congenital insensitivity to pain create a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the alpha subunit of the NaV1.7 sodium channel. As a result, a shortened, nonfunctional subunit is produced which cannot be incorporated into the channel, leading to a loss of functional NaV1.7 sodium channels. The loss of these channels impairs the transmission of pain signals from the site of injury to the brain, causing those affected to be insensitive to pain. Loss of this channel in olfactory sensory neurons likely impairs the transmission of smell-related signals to the brain, leading to a complete loss of the sense of smell (anosmia). "
1170,SCN10A ,sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 10,"The SCN10A gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making sodium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged sodium atoms (sodium ions) into cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.The SCN10A gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha subunit) of a sodium channel called NaV1.8. NaV1.8 sodium channels are found in nerve cells called nociceptors that transmit pain signals. Nociceptors are part of the peripheral nervous system, which connects the brain and spinal cord to cells that detect sensations such as touch, smell, and pain. Nociceptors are primarily involved in transmitting pain signals. The centers of nociceptors, known as the cell bodies, are located in a part of the spinal cord called the dorsal root ganglion. Fibers called axons extend from the cell bodies, reaching throughout the body to receive sensory information. In addition to nociceptors, NaV1.8 sodium channels have also been found in heart muscle cells where, by controlling the flow of sodium ions, they likely play a role in maintaining a normal heart rhythm.","Small fiber neuropathy Mutations in the SCN10A gene account for approximately 5 percent of cases of small fiber neuropathy, a condition characterized by severe pain attacks and a reduced ability to differentiate between hot and cold. The mutations that cause this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the alpha subunit of the NaV1.8 sodium channel. Many of the mutations result in NaV1.8 sodium channels that open more easily than usual, increasing the flow of sodium ions that produce nerve impulses within nociceptors. This increase in sodium ions enhances transmission of pain signals, causing individuals to be more sensitive to stimulation that might otherwise not cause pain. In this condition, the small fibers that extend from the nociceptors and transmit pain signals (axons) degenerate over time. The cause of this degeneration is unknown, but it likely accounts for signs and symptoms such as the loss of temperature differentiation. "
1171,SCNN1A ,sodium channel epithelial 1 alpha subunit,"The SCNN1A gene provides instructions for making one piece, the alpha subunit, of a protein complex called the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). The channel is composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, each of which is produced from a different gene. These channels are found at the surface of certain cells called epithelial cells in many tissues of the body, including the kidneys, lungs, and sweat glands. The ENaC channel transports sodium into cells.In the kidney, ENaC channels take sodium into cells in response to signals that sodium levels in the body are too low. From the kidney cells, this sodium is returned to the bloodstream rather than being removed from the body (a process called reabsorption). In addition to regulating the amount of sodium in the body, the flow of sodium ions helps control the movement of water in tissues. For example, ENaC channels in lung cells help regulate the amount of fluid in the lungs.","Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 At least a dozen mutations in the SCNN1A gene cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1). This condition typically begins in infancy and is characterized by low levels of sodium (hyponatremia) and high levels of potassium (hyperkalemia) in the blood and severe dehydration. In particular, SCNN1A gene mutations are involved in autosomal recessive PHA1, a severe form of the condition that does not improve with age.Most mutations in the SCNN1A gene result in a shortened alpha subunit protein of the ENaC channel. Other mutations delete a small piece of DNA or change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the alpha subunit protein. SCNN1A gene mutations lead to reduced or absent ENaC channel activity. As a result, sodium reabsorption is impaired, leading to hyponatremia and other signs and symptoms of autosomal recessive PHA1. The reduced function of ENaC channels in lung epithelial cells leads to excess fluid in the lungs and recurrent lung infections. "
1172,SCNN1B ,sodium channel epithelial 1 beta subunit,"The SCNN1B gene provides instructions for making one piece, the beta subunit, of a protein complex called the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). The channel is composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, each of which is produced from a different gene. These channels are found at the surface of certain cells called epithelial cells in many tissues of the body, including the kidneys, lungs, colon, and sweat glands. The ENaC channel transports sodium into cells.In the kidney, ENaC channels open in response to signals that sodium levels in the blood are too low, which allows sodium to flow into cells. From the kidney cells, this sodium is returned to the bloodstream (a process called reabsorption) rather than being removed from the body in urine. In addition to regulating the amount of sodium in the body, the flow of sodium ions helps control the movement of water in tissues. For example, ENaC channels in lung cells help regulate the amount of fluid in the lungs.","Liddle syndrome At least 16 mutations in the SCNN1B gene can cause a condition known as Liddle syndrome. People with Liddle syndrome have high blood pressure (hypertension) and low levels of potassium in their blood (hypokalemia), often beginning in childhood. Mutations in the SCNN1B gene associated with Liddle syndrome lead to the production of an abnormally short beta subunit protein or result in the replacement of a single protein building block (amino acid) in the protein. These changes affect an important region of the protein involved in signaling for its breakdown (degradation). As a result of the mutations, the protein is not degraded, and more ENaC channels remain at the cell surface. The increase in channels at the cell surface abnormally increases the reabsorption of sodium (followed by water), which leads to hypertension. Reabsorption of sodium into the blood is linked with removal of potassium from the blood, so excess sodium reabsorption leads to hypokalemia. "
1173,SCNN1G ,sodium channel epithelial 1 gamma subunit,"The SCNN1G gene provides instructions for making one piece, the gamma subunit, of a protein complex called the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC).

People with Liddle syndrome have high blood pressure (hypertension) and low levels of potassium in their blood (hypokalemia), often beginning in childhood. Mutations in the SCNN1G gene associated with Liddle syndrome lead to the production of an abnormally short gamma subunit protein.

1174,SDHA ,succinate dehydrogenase complex flavoprotein subunit A,"The SDHA gene provides instructions for making one of four parts (subunits) of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) enzyme. The SDH enzyme plays a critical role in mitochondria, which are structures inside cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use.Within mitochondria, the SDH enzyme links two important pathways in energy conversion: the citric acid cycle (or Krebs cycle) and oxidative phosphorylation. As part of the citric acid cycle, the SDH enzyme converts a compound called succinate to another compound called fumarate. Negatively charged particles called electrons are released during this reaction. The SDHA protein is the active subunit of the enzyme that performs the conversion of succinate, and it also helps transfer electrons to the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. In oxidative phosphorylation, the electrons help create an electrical charge that provides energy for the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source.Succinate, the compound on which the SDH enzyme acts, is an oxygen sensor in the cell and can help turn on specific pathways that stimulate cells to grow in a low-oxygen environment (hypoxia). In particular, succinate stabilizes a protein called hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) by preventing a reaction that would allow HIF to be broken down. HIF controls several important genes involved in cell division and the formation of new blood vessels in a hypoxic environment.The SDHA gene is a tumor suppressor gene, which means it prevents cells from growing and dividing in an uncontrolled way.","Nonsyndromic paraganglioma At least three mutations in the SDHA gene have been identified in people with paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma (a type of paraganglioma), which are noncancerous (benign) tumors associated with the nervous system. SDHA gene mutations are seen most commonly in people with paraganglioma, but they have been found in people with pheochromocytoma. Specifically, SDHA gene mutations are associated with nonsyndromic paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma, which means the tumors are not part of an inherited syndrome.A single mutation in the SDHA gene increases the risk that an individual will develop the condition. However, an additional mutation that deletes the normal copy of the gene is needed to cause tumor formation. This second mutation, called a somatic mutation, is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in tumor cells.The SDHA gene mutations associated with nonsyndromic paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SDHA protein sequence or result in a shortened protein. As a result, there is little or no SDH enzyme activity. Because the mutated SDH enzyme cannot convert succinate to fumarate, succinate accumulates in the cell. The excess succinate abnormally stabilizes HIF, which also builds up in cells. Excess HIF stimulates cells to divide and triggers the production of blood vessels when they are not needed. Rapid and uncontrolled cell division, along with the formation of new blood vessels, can lead to the development of tumors. "
1175,SDHAF2 ,succinate dehydrogenase complex assembly factor 2,"The SDHAF2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that interacts with the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) enzyme. The SDHAF2 protein helps a molecule called FAD attach to the SDH enzyme. FAD is called a cofactor because it helps the enzyme carry out its function. The FAD cofactor is required for SDH enzyme activity.The SDH enzyme plays a critical role in mitochondria, which are structures inside cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Within mitochondria, the SDH enzyme links two important pathways in energy conversion: the citric acid cycle (or Krebs cycle) and oxidative phosphorylation.

HIF controls several important genes involved in cell division and the formation of new blood vessels in a hypoxic environment.The SDHAF2 gene is a tumor suppressor, which means it prevents cells from growing and dividing in an uncontrolled way.","Hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma At least one mutation in the SDHAF2 gene has been identified in people with hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma type 2. People with this condition have paragangliomas, pheochromocytomas, or both. These noncancerous (benign) tumors are associated with the nervous system. The mutation replaces a protein building block (amino acid) in the SDHAF2 protein. Specifically, the amino acid glycine is replaced with the amino acid arginine at position 78 (written as Gly78Arg or G78R). The interaction between the mutated SDHAF2 protein and the SDH complex is impaired, and attachment of the FAD cofactor is decreased. As a result, the SDH enzyme is nonfunctional. Because the mutated SDH enzyme cannot convert succinate to fumarate, succinate accumulates in the cell. Excess succinate abnormally stabilizes HIF, which also builds up in cells. Excess HIF stimulates cells to divide and triggers the production of blood vessels when they are not needed. Rapid and uncontrolled cell division, along with the formation of new blood vessels, can lead to the development of tumors in people with hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma. "

People with this condition have paragangliomas, pheochromocytomas, or both. Paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas (a type of paraganglioma) are noncancerous tumors associated with the nervous system. An inherited SDHB gene mutation predisposes an individual to the condition, and a somatic mutation that deletes the normal copy of the gene is needed to cause hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma type 4.Most of the inherited SDHB gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SDHB protein sequence or result in a shortened protein. As a result, there is little or no SDH enzyme activity. Because the mutated SDH enzyme cannot convert succinate to fumarate, succinate accumulates in the cell.

1177,SDHC ,succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit C,"The SDHC gene provides instructions for making one of four subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) enzyme. The SDH enzyme plays a critical role in mitochondria, which are structures inside cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. The SDHC protein helps anchor the SDH enzyme in the mitochondrial membrane.Within mitochondria, the SDH enzyme links two important cellular pathways in energy conversion: the citric acid cycle (or Krebs cycle) and oxidative phosphorylation.

People with this condition have paragangliomas, pheochromocytomas, or both. An inherited SDHC gene mutation predisposes an individual to the condition, and a somatic mutation that deletes the normal copy of the SDHC gene is needed to cause hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma type 3.Most of the inherited SDHC gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SDHC protein sequence or result in a shortened protein.

1179,SEC23B ,"Sec23 homolog B, coat complex II component","The SEC23B gene provides instructions for making one component of a large group of interacting proteins called coat protein complex II (COPII). COPII is involved in the formation of vesicles, which are small sac-like structures that transport proteins and other materials within cells. Specifically, COPII triggers the formation of vesicles in a cellular structure called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is involved in protein processing and transport. These COPII vesicles carry proteins that are destined to be exported out of cells (secreted).The SEC23B protein is very similar to the protein produced from a related gene, SEC23A. These proteins are both components of COPII, and they appear to have overlapping functions. In most types of cells, if one of these proteins is missing, the other may be able to compensate for the loss. However, research indicates that the SEC23B protein may have a unique function in developing red blood cells (erythroblasts).","Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia At least 20 mutations in the SEC23B gene have been identified in people with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) type II. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SEC23B protein. Other mutations delete genetic material from the SEC23B gene or alter the way the gene's instructions are used to make the SEC23B protein. The mutations responsible for CDA type II likely disrupt the function of the SEC23B protein. However, researchers suspect that these mutations do not completely eliminate the function of the protein, which appears to be essential for life.It is unclear how SEC23B mutations cause the characteristic features of CDA type II. The abnormal SEC23B protein leads to the production of erythroblasts that are unusually shaped and may have extra nuclei. These defective erythroblasts cannot develop into functional mature red blood cells. The resulting shortage of healthy red blood cells leads to the characteristic signs and symptoms of anemia, as well as complications including an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) and an abnormal buildup of iron that can damage the body's organs. "
1180,SELENON ,selenoprotein N,"The SELENON gene (also called SEPN1) provides instructions for making a protein called selenoprotein N. This protein is part of a family of selenoproteins, which have several critical functions within the body. Selenoproteins are primarily involved in chemical reactions called oxidation-reduction reactions, which are essential for protecting cells from damage caused by unstable oxygen-containing molecules. Although the exact function of selenoprotein N is unknown, it is likely involved in protecting cells against oxidative stress. Oxidative stress occurs when unstable molecules called free radicals accumulate to levels that damage or kill cells.Selenoprotein N is highly active in many tissues before birth and may be involved in the formation of muscle tissue (myogenesis). The protein may also be important for normal muscle function after birth, although it is active at much lower levels in adult tissues. This protein contains a region that likely allows it to interact with calcium. This region is of interest because calcium plays an important role in triggering muscle contractions.","Multiminicore disease At least 17 mutations in the SELENON gene have been identified in people with the classic form of multiminicore disease. This condition is named for a distinctive abnormality in the muscle fibers called minicores (which can only be seen with a microscope). In addition, affected individuals have muscle weakness, particularly in the muscles of the torso and neck (the axial muscles); a rigid neck and back; abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis); and serious breathing problems. Many of the genetic changes that cause classic multiminicore disease lead to the production of an abnormally short version of selenoprotein N. Other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in critical regions of the protein. The effects of changes in the structure and function of selenoprotein N are unknown, and researchers are working to determine how these changes lead to muscle weakness and the other characteristic features of classic multiminicore disease. "
1181,SEPSECS ,Sep (O-phosphoserine) tRNA:Sec (selenocysteine) tRNA synthase,"The SEPSECS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme known as SepSecS. This enzyme is involved in the formation of a molecule called a transfer RNA (tRNA), which is a chemical cousin of DNA that is needed for building proteins. This particular tRNA plays a critical role in the production of a protein building block (amino acid) called selenocysteine (Sec). Selenocysteine contains the chemical element selenium, which is an essential nutrient obtained from the diet.Proteins that contain selenocysteine are called selenoproteins. Researchers have identified about 25 human selenoproteins with diverse functions. For example, these proteins are involved in antioxidant reactions, which protect cells against compounds called reactive oxygen species that can damage DNA, proteins, and cell membranes. Selenoproteins also play a role in turning on (activating) thyroid hormones and are involved in immune system function and the production of sperm cells. Additionally, studies suggest that selenoproteins are critical for normal brain development and for the function of nerve cells (neurons).","Pontocerebellar hypoplasia At least three mutations in the SEPSECS gene have been identified in people with a disorder of brain development called pontocerebellar hypoplasia. The major features of this condition include delayed development, problems with movement, and intellectual disability. SEPSECS gene mutations have been found to cause a form of the disorder designated pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2 (PCH2) in several families of Iraqi and Moroccan ancestry. When PCH2 results from mutations in the SEPSECS gene, it is sometimes categorized more specifically as PCH2D. The signs and symptoms of PCH2D appear to be somewhat less severe than other forms of pontocerebellar hypoplasia. Researchers also refer to PCH2D as progressive cerebellocerebral atrophy (PCCA).The SEPSECS gene mutations that cause PCH2D completely eliminate the function of SepSecS. A lack of this enzyme's function impairs the production of selenocysteine and the subsequent formation of selenoproteins. It is unclear how a shortage of these proteins contributes to abnormal brain development in people with PCH2D. "
1182,SEPTIN9 ,septin 9,"The SEPTIN9 gene provides instructions for making a protein called septin-9, which is part of a group of proteins called septins. Septins are involved in a process called cytokinesis, which is the step in cell division when the fluid inside the cell (cytoplasm) divides to form two separate cells. The septin-9 protein also seems to act as a tumor suppressor, which means that it regulates cell growth and keeps cells from dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way.The SEPTIN9 gene seems to be turned on (active) in cells throughout the body. Approximately 15 slightly different versions (isoforms) of the septin-9 protein may be produced from this gene. Some types of cells make certain isoforms, while other cell types produce other isoforms. However, the specific distribution of these isoforms in the body's tissues is not well understood. Septin-9 isoforms interact with other septin proteins to perform some of their functions.","Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy A few SEPTIN9 gene mutations have been identified in individuals with hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy, a disorder characterized by episodes of severe pain and muscle wasting (amyotrophy) in the shoulders and arms. The most common mutation results in the replacement of the protein building block (amino acid) arginine with the amino acid tryptophan at position 88 in the septin-9 protein sequence, written as Arg88Trp or R88W. This mutation has appeared in several unrelated families from different parts of the world. Duplication of genetic material within the SEPTIN9 gene has also been identified in affected individuals.Changes in the SEPTIN9 gene may alter the sequence of amino acids in certain septin-9 isoforms in ways that interfere with their function. These mutations may also change the distribution of septin-9 isoforms and their interactions with other septin proteins in some of the body's tissues. This change in the functioning of septin proteins seems to particularly affect the network of nerves controlling movement and sensation in the shoulders and arms (brachial plexus), but the reason for this is unknown.Because many of the triggers for episodes of hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy also affect the immune system, researchers believe that an autoimmune reaction may be involved in this disorder. However, the relation between SEPTIN9 gene mutations and immune function is unclear. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. An autoimmune attack on the nerves in the brachial plexus likely results in the signs and symptoms of hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy. "
1183,SERAC1 ,serine active site containing 1,"The SERAC1 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not completely understood. Studies suggest that the SERAC1 protein is involved in altering (remodeling) certain fats called phospholipids, particularly a phospholipid called phosphatidylglycerol.Another phospholipid called cardiolipin is made from phosphatidylglycerol. Cardiolipin is a component of the membrane that surrounds cellular structures called mitochondria, which convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use, and is important for the proper functioning of these structures.Researchers believe that the SERAC1 protein is also involved in the movement of a waxy, fat-like substance called cholesterol within cells. Cholesterol is a structural component of cell membranes and plays a role in the production of certain hormones and digestive acids. It has important functions both before and after birth.","MEGDEL syndrome At least 16 mutations in the SERAC1 gene have been found to cause MEGDEL syndrome. This condition is characterized by hearing loss, neurological problems, certain changes in the brain described as Leigh-like disease, and abnormally high amounts of an acid called 3-methylglutaconic acid in the urine. The SERAC1 gene mutations that cause this condition reduce the amount of SERAC1 protein that is produced or lead to production of a protein with little or no function. As a result, phosphatidylglycerol remodeling is impaired, which likely alters the composition of cardiolipin. Researchers speculate that the abnormal cardiolipin affects mitochondrial function, reducing cellular energy production and leading to the neurological and hearing problems characteristic of MEGDEL syndrome. It is unclear how SERAC1 gene mutations lead to abnormal release of 3-methylglutaconic acid in the urine. "
1184,SERPINA1 ,serpin family A member 1,"The SERPINA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin, which is a type of serine protease inhibitor (serpin). Serpins help control several types of chemical reactions by blocking (inhibiting) the activity of certain enzymes. Alpha-1 antitrypsin prevents the digestive enzyme trypsin from breaking down proteins until trypsin reaches the intestines. Alpha-1 antitrypsin also inhibits other enzymes, including a powerful enzyme called neutrophil elastase that is released from white blood cells to fight infection.Alpha-1 antitrypsin protects the lungs from neutrophil elastase, which can damage lung tissue if not properly controlled. Alpha-1 antitrypsin is produced in the liver and then transported to the lungs via the blood.","Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency More than 120 mutations in the SERPINA1 gene have been identified. Some of these mutations do not affect the production of alpha-1 antitrypsin, while others cause a shortage (deficiency) of the protein. Without enough functional alpha-1 antitrypsin, neutrophil elastase destroys the small air sacs in the lungs (alveoli) and causes lung disease. Excessive damage to the alveoli leads to emphysema, an irreversible lung disease that causes extreme shortness of breath.Many SERPINA1 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in alpha-1 antitrypsin, which alters the protein's structure. The most common mutation that causes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency replaces the amino acid glutamic acid with the amino acid lysine at protein position 342 (written as Glu342Lys or E342K). This mutation results in a version of the SERPINA1 gene called the Z allele that produces very little alpha-1 antitrypsin.Abnormal alpha-1 antitrypsin proteins may bind together to form a large molecule, or polymer, that cannot leave the liver. The accumulation of these polymers results in liver damage. In addition, lung tissue is destroyed because not enough alpha-1 antitrypsin is available to protect against neutrophil elastase. Polymers of alpha-1 antitrypsin may also contribute to excessive inflammation, which may explain some of the other features of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, such as a skin condition called panniculitis.Other SERPINA1 gene mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small form of alpha-1 antitrypsin that is quickly broken down in the liver. As a result, little or no alpha-1 antitrypsin is available in the lungs. While the liver remains healthy in individuals with these mutations, the lungs are left unprotected from neutrophil elastase. "
1185,SERPINA6 ,serpin family A member 6,"The SERPINA6 gene provides instructions for making a protein called corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), which is primarily produced in the liver. The CBG protein attaches (binds) to a hormone called cortisol, which has numerous functions, such as maintaining blood sugar levels, protecting the body from stress, and suppressing inflammation. When cortisol is bound to CBG, the hormone is turned off (inactive). Normally, around 80 to 90 percent of the body's cortisol is bound to CBG, 5 to 10 percent is unbound and active, and the remaining cortisol is bound to another protein called albumin. When cortisol is needed in the body, CBG delivers the cortisol to the appropriate tissues and releases it, causing cortisol to become active. In this manner, CBG regulates the amount of cortisol that is available for use in the body. The amount of total cortisol in the body consists of both bound (inactive) and unbound (active) cortisol.","Corticosteroid-binding globulin deficiency More than 10 mutations in the SERPINA6 gene have been found to cause corticosteroid-binding globulin deficiency. This condition can cause extreme tiredness (fatigue), low blood pressure (hypotension), or chronic pain. However, some people with this condition do not experience any symptoms.The mutations that cause corticosteroid-binding globulin deficiency often decrease the CBG protein's ability to bind to cortisol; some severe mutations prevent the production of any CBG protein. With less functional CBG to bind cortisol, people with corticosteroid-binding globulin deficiency usually have increased unbound cortisol levels. Typically, the body decreases cortisol production to compensate, resulting in a reduction in total cortisol.It is unclear how a decrease in CBG protein and total cortisol leads to the signs and symptoms of corticosteroid-binding globulin deficiency. Since the CBG protein is needed to transport cortisol to specific tissues at certain times, it may be that while cortisol is available in the body, the cortisol is not getting to the tissues that require it. A decrease in cortisol may influence widening or narrowing of the blood vessels, contributing to abnormal blood pressure. Some researchers think the features may influence each other and that fatigue could be a result of chronic pain rather than a symptom of the disorder itself. There may also be other genetic or environmental factors that influence whether an affected individual is more likely to develop pain or fatigue. "
1186,SERPINA7 ,serpin family A member 7,"The SERPINA7 gene (also known as TBG) provides instructions for making a protein called thyroxine-binding globulin. In the bloodstream, this protein carries hormones made or used by the thyroid gland, which is a butterfly-shaped tissue in the lower neck. Thyroid hormones play an important role in regulating growth, brain development, and the rate of chemical reactions in the body (metabolism). Most of the time, thyroid hormones circulate in the bloodstream attached to thyroxine-binding globulin and similar proteins.","Inherited thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency More than 25 mutations in the SERPINA7 gene have been identified in people with inherited thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency. Some mutations lead to a shortened, nonfunctional version of thyroxine-binding globulin. These genetic changes result in a total loss of the protein, which causes the complete form of inherited thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency (TBG-CD). Other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in thyroxine-binding globulin. These mutations alter the structure or processing of the protein, leading to the partial form of the disorder (TBG-PD).When there is a shortage of thyroxine-binding globulin, the amount of circulating thyroid hormones is reduced. These changes do not cause any problems with thyroid function. Although inherited thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency does not cause any health problems, it can be mistaken for more serious thyroid disorders (such as hypothyroidism). Therefore, it is important to diagnose inherited thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency to avoid unnecessary treatments. "
1187,SERPINC1 ,serpin family C member 1,"The SERPINC1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called antithrombin (previously known as antithrombin III), which is a type of serine protease inhibitor (serpin). Serpins help control several types of chemical reactions by blocking the activity of certain proteins. Antithrombin is found in the bloodstream and is important for controlling blood clotting.Antithrombin blocks the activity of proteins that promote blood clotting, especially a protein called thrombin. Antithrombin attaches (binds) to thrombin and certain other clotting proteins, which are then cleared from the bloodstream by the liver.While one part of antithrombin binds to thrombin and other clotting proteins, another part of the protein binds to a substance called heparin. Antithrombin changes its shape when it binds to heparin. This change in shape allows antithrombin to inactivate clotting proteins at a much faster rate.","Hereditary antithrombin deficiency At least 220 mutations in the SERPINC1 gene have been found to cause hereditary antithrombin deficiency. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in antithrombin, which disrupts its ability to control blood clotting.Hereditary antithrombin deficiency can be divided into type I and type II based on the mutation in the SERPINC1 gene.Hereditary antithrombin deficiency type I is caused by SERPINC1 gene mutations that prevent the cell from producing antithrombin from the altered gene. Individuals with this type have only one working copy of the SERPINC1 gene in each cell, which results in approximately half of the normal amount of antithrombin. Affected individuals do not have enough antithrombin to inactivate clotting proteins, which causes the increased risk for abnormal blood clots in hereditary antithrombin deficiency.Mutations that cause hereditary antithrombin deficiency type II result in the production of an altered antithrombin with reduced activity. Individuals with this form of the condition typically have normal levels of antithrombin, but the protein does not function properly. Type II can be further divided based on whether the mutation affects binding to thrombin and other clotting factors (type IIa), heparin (type IIb), or both (type IIc). Individuals with hereditary antithrombin deficiency type IIb have a lower risk of forming an abnormal blood clot than people with other forms of this condition because antithrombin is able to inactivate clotting proteins without heparin. "
1188,SERPINE1 ,serpin family E member 1,"The SERPINE1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). PAI-1 is involved in normal blood clotting (hemostasis). After an injury, clots protect the body by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss.The PAI-1 protein blocks (inhibits) the action of other proteins called plasminogen activators. These proteins, including urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA) and tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA), convert an inactive enzyme called plasminogen to its active form, plasmin. Plasmin is involved in fibrinolysis, which is the process of dissolving blood clots. By inhibiting the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, and thereby preventing fibrinolysis, the PAI-1 protein helps ensure that clots are only dissolved when they are no longer needed to stop bleeding.In addition to its role in hemostasis, PAI-1 is also thought to be involved in cell movement (migration) and the breakdown and replacement (remodeling) of body tissues.","Complete plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 deficiency At least three SERPINE1 gene mutations have been identified in people with complete plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) deficiency, a disorder that causes abnormal bleeding. In people with this disorder, bleeding after an injury can be excessive and last longer than usual. Affected females may have excessive bleeding associated with menstruation (menorrhagia), and abnormal bleeding in pregnancy and childbirth.The SERPINE1 gene mutations that cause complete PAI-1 deficiency result in impaired production of the PAI-1 protein, or lead to production of PAI-1 protein that is nonfunctional or that is unstable and quickly broken down. Absence of functional PAI-1 protein allows plasminogen activators to dissolve blood clots prematurely, resulting in the abnormal bleeding associated with this disorder. "
1189,SERPING1 ,serpin family G member 1,"The SERPING1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called C1 inhibitor, which is a type of serine protease inhibitor (serpin). Serpins help control several types of chemical reactions by blocking the activity of certain proteins. C1 inhibitor is important for controlling a range of processes involved in maintaining blood vessels, including inflammation. Inflammation is a normal body response to infection, irritation, or other injury.C1 inhibitor blocks the activity of several proteins in the blood, including plasma kallikrein and the activated form of factor XII (called factor XIIa). These two proteins are involved in the production of bradykinin. Bradykinin is a protein that promotes inflammation by increasing the permeability of blood vessel walls, allowing fluids to leak into body tissues. C1 inhibitor attaches (binds) to plasma kallikrein and factor XIIa, which prevents them from completing any further reactions. These proteins are cleared from the bloodstream once they are bound to C1 inhibitor.","Hereditary angioedema More than 250 mutations in the SERPING1 gene have been found to cause hereditary angioedema types I and II. Mutations that cause type I occur throughout the gene and lead to reduced levels of C1 inhibitor in the blood. Mutations that cause type II usually occur in a specific region of the gene called exon 8 and result in the production of a C1 inhibitor that functions abnormally. Without the proper levels of functional C1 inhibitor, the activity of plasma kallikrein and factor XIIa cannot be blocked and excessive amounts of bradykinin are produced. Excess fluids leak through blood vessel walls and accumulate in body tissues, leading to the recurrent episodes of swelling seen in individuals with hereditary angioedema type I and type II. "
1190,SERPINI1 ,serpin family I member 1,"The SERPINI1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called neuroserpin, which is a type of serine protease inhibitor (serpin). Serpins help control several kinds of chemical reactions by blocking (inhibiting) the activity of certain proteins. Neuroserpin inhibits the activity of an enzyme called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which plays a role in cell movement (migration), blood clotting, and inflammation.As its name suggests, neuroserpin is involved in the development and function of the nervous system. This protein helps control the growth of nerve cells (neurons), particularly specialized extensions called axons that are required for the transmission of nerve impulses. Neuroserpin also plays a role in the development of synapses, which are the connections between neurons where cell-to-cell communication occurs. Synapses can change and adapt over time in response to experience, a characteristic called synaptic plasticity. Neuroserpin helps regulate synaptic plasticity, which suggests that it may be important for learning and memory.","Familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies At least four mutations in the SERPINI1 gene have been found to cause familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FENIB). Each of these mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) used to make the neuroserpin protein. These changes result in the production of an abnormally shaped, unstable version of neuroserpin. Within neurons, defective neuroserpin proteins can attach to one another and form clumps called neuroserpin inclusion bodies or Collins bodies. These clumps disrupt the cells' normal functioning and ultimately lead to cell death. The gradual loss of neurons in certain parts of the brain causes progressive dementia in people with FENIB.SERPINI1 mutations also reduce or eliminate the ability of neuroserpin to inhibit tPA in neurons. Researchers believe that unchecked activity of tPA may also contribute to the signs and symptoms of this condition.Some SERPINI1 mutations cause more severe forms of FENIB than others. The severity of the disease and its age of onset are correlated with the number of Collins bodies within neurons. One mutation, known as neuroserpin Syracuse, is associated with a moderate form of the disorder that causes a progressive decline in intellectual functioning beginning in a person's forties or fifties. This genetic change replaces the amino acid serine with the amino acid proline at position 49 in the neuroserpin protein (written as Ser49Pro or S49P).Other SERPINI1 mutations cause a more severe form of FENIB that is characterized by seizures and episodes of sudden, involuntary muscle jerking or twitching (myoclonus) in addition to dementia. These signs can appear as early as a person's teens. One of these severe mutations, called neuroserpin Portland, replaces the amino acid serine with the amino acid arginine at position 52 in the neuroserpin protein (written as Ser52Arg or S52R). Another mutation replaces the amino acid glycine with one of two other amino acids, glutamic acid or arginine, at protein position 392. (These mutations are written as Gly392Glu and Gly392Arg, respectively.) Children with one of these genetic changes experience a very severe form of the disorder that includes a combination of seizures and uncontrollable muscle jerks (myoclonic epilepsy) and delayed development. "
1191,SETBP1 ,SET binding protein 1,"The SETBP1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called SET binding protein 1 (SETBP1), which is found in cells throughout the body. The SETBP1 protein is part of a group of proteins that attaches (binds) to certain regions of DNA to increase gene activity (expression). The protein primarily binds to sections called promoter regions, which control (regulate) the production of proteins.SETBP1 protein levels are highest during brain development before birth. During this time, nerve cells grow and divide (proliferate) and move (migrate) to their proper location in the brain. The SETBP1 protein is thought to control genes that are involved in these developmental processes.","Schinzel-Giedion syndrome At least 16 mutations in the SETBP1 gene have been identified in children with Schinzel-Giedion syndrome, a severe condition apparent at birth that is characterized by distinctive facial features and abnormalities in many body systems. The gene mutations in affected individuals typically occur in a region of the gene known as exon 4. All of these mutations result in the change of single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SETBP1 protein. These mutations are described as ""gain-of-function"" mutations because they increase the activity of the SETBP1 protein. Increased SETBP1 protein activity probably alters the expression of other genes, particularly genes involved in development before birth, and likely contributes to the many features of Schinzel-Giedion syndrome. However, the exact mechanism that causes this condition is still unclear. "
1192,SETX ,senataxin,"The SETX gene provides instructions for making a protein called senataxin. Senataxin is produced in a wide range of tissues, including the brain, spinal cord, and muscles. Based on the structure of senataxin, researchers believe that it is one of a class of proteins called helicases, which attach to particular regions of DNA or RNA (a chemical cousin of DNA) and temporarily unwind the strands of the molecule. By unwinding the strands, helicases allow other proteins to reach the strands to perform their function. Although senataxin's role in cells is not completely understood, it appears to be involved in the production of proteins from genes (transcription), the processing of RNA molecules, and the repair of damaged DNA.",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Genetics Home Reference provides information about amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 
1193,SF3B4 ,splicing factor 3b subunit 4,"The SF3B4 gene provides instructions for making the SAP49 protein, which is part of a complex called a spliceosome. Spliceosomes help process messenger RNA (mRNA), which is a chemical cousin of DNA that serves as a genetic blueprint for making proteins. The spliceosomes recognize and then remove regions from mRNA molecules that are not used in the blueprint (which are called introns).The SAP49 protein may also be involved in a chemical signaling pathway known as the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) pathway. This signaling pathway regulates various cellular processes and is involved in the growth of cells. The SAP49 protein is particularly important for the maturation of cells that build bones and cartilage (osteoblasts and chondrocytes).","Nager syndrome More than 30 mutations in the SF3B4 gene have been found to cause Nager syndrome, which is primarily characterized by abnormalities of the face, hands, and arms, such as underdeveloped cheek bones (malar hypoplasia), a small lower jaw (micrognathia), and malformed or absent thumbs. The condition can also affect development of other parts of the body. More than half of people with this condition have a mutation in the SF3B4 gene. These mutations prevent the production of SAP49 protein or lead to production of a nonfunctional protein. It is unclear how a shortage of functional SAP49 protein leads to the development problems in Nager syndrome. Researchers suspect that problems with spliceosome formation may impair mRNA processing and alter the activity of genes involved in development of several parts of the body. A loss of SAP49 may also impair BMP pathway signaling, leading to abnormal development of bones in the face, hands, and arms. "
1194,SFRP4 ,secreted frizzled related protein 4,"The SFRP4 gene provides instructions for making a protein called secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4). This protein blocks (inhibits) a process called Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling plays an important role in the development of several tissues and organs throughout the body. In particular, regulation of this signaling process by SFRP4 is critical for normal bone development and remodeling. Bone remodeling is a normal process in which old bone is broken down and new bone is created to replace it. The SFRP4 protein also plays a role in the development of fatty (adipose) tissue.","Pyle disease At least four SFRP4 gene mutations have been found in individuals with a bone disorder called Pyle disease. This condition is characterized by a bone abnormality in which the ends (metaphyses) of the long bones in the arms and legs are abnormally wide, resembling a boat oar or paddle. Other bones may also be abnormal in Pyle disease, including the collar bones (clavicles), ribs, and bones in the fingers and hands. The SFRP4 gene mutations are thought to lead to production of an abnormally short SFRP4 protein with impaired function, or they result in no SFRP4 protein production at all. Studies suggest that loss of functional SFRP4 dysregulates Wnt signaling, which disrupts normal bone development and remodeling. Abnormal bone formation leads to the characteristics of Pyle disease. "
1195,SFTPB ,surfactant protein B,"The SFTPB gene provides instructions for making a protein called surfactant protein-B (SP-B). This protein is one of four proteins (each produced from a different gene) in surfactant, a mixture of certain fats (called phospholipids) and proteins that lines the lung tissue and makes breathing easy. Without normal surfactant, the tissue surrounding the air sacs in the lungs (the alveoli) sticks together after exhalation (because of a force called surface tension), causing the alveoli to collapse. As a result, filling the lungs with air on each breath becomes very difficult, and the delivery of oxygen to the body is impaired. Surfactant lowers surface tension, easing breathing and avoiding lung collapse. The SP-B protein helps spread the surfactant across the surface of the lung tissue, aiding in the surface tension-lowering property of surfactant.The phospholipids and proteins that make up surfactant are packaged in cellular structures known as lamellar bodies, which are found in specialized lung cells. The surfactant proteins must go through several processing steps to mature and become functional; some of these steps occur in lamellar bodies. The SP-B protein plays a role in the formation of lamellar bodies and, thus, affects the processing of a surfactant protein called surfactant protein-C (SP-C).","Surfactant dysfunction More than 30 mutations in the SFTPB gene that cause surfactant dysfunction have been identified. Surfactant dysfunction due to SFTPB gene mutations (often called SP-B deficiency) causes severe, often fatal breathing problems in newborns. These mutations lead to partial or complete loss of mature SP-B, resulting in abnormal composition of surfactant and decreased surfactant function. In addition, lamellar body formation is impaired. The lack of normal lamellar bodies leads to abnormal processing of SP-C, resulting in a reduction of mature SP-C and a buildup of unprocessed forms of SP-C. The loss of functional surfactant raises surface tension in the alveoli, causing difficulty breathing and collapse of the lungs. The combination of SP-B and SP-C dysfunction may explain why the signs and symptoms of SP-B deficiency are so severe. "
1196,SFTPC ,surfactant protein C,"The SFTPC gene provides instructions for making a protein called surfactant protein-C (SP-C). This protein is one of four proteins (each produced from a different gene) in surfactant, a mixture of certain fats (called phospholipids) and proteins that lines the lung tissue and makes breathing easy. Without normal surfactant, the tissue surrounding the air sacs in the lungs (the alveoli) sticks together after exhalation (because of a force called surface tension), causing the alveoli to collapse. As a result, filling the lungs with air on each breath becomes very difficult, and the delivery of oxygen to the body is impaired. Surfactant lowers surface tension, easing breathing and avoiding lung collapse. The SP-C protein helps spread the surfactant across the surface of the lung tissue, aiding in the surface tension-lowering property of surfactant.The phospholipids and proteins that make up surfactant are packaged in cellular structures known as lamellar bodies, which are found in specialized lung cells. The surfactant proteins must go through several processing steps to mature and become functional; some of these steps occur in lamellar bodies.","Surfactant dysfunction More than 35 mutations in the SFTPC gene have been identified in people with surfactant dysfunction. When this condition is caused by mutations in the SFTPC gene (sometimes called SP-C dysfunction), it can cause severe breathing problems in newborns or gradual onset of milder breathing problems in children or adults.SFTPC gene mutations associated with surfactant dysfunction affect the processing of the SP-C protein. Many of the mutations occur in a particular region of the gene called the BRICHOS domain, which appears to be involved in the processing and cellular placement of the SP-C protein.Mutations in the SFTPC gene result in a reduction or absence of mature SP-C and a buildup of abnormal forms of SP-C. It is unclear which of these outcomes causes the signs and symptoms of SP-C dysfunction. Lack of mature SP-C can lead to abnormal composition of surfactant and decreased surfactant function. The loss of functional surfactant would raise surface tension in the alveoli, causing difficulty breathing and collapse of the lungs. Alternatively, research suggests that abnormally processed SP-C proteins form the wrong three-dimensional shape and accumulate inside lung cells. These misfolded proteins may trigger a cellular response that results in cell damage and death. This damage may disrupt surfactant production and release, leading to the breathing problems associated with surfactant dysfunction. "
1197,SGCA ,sarcoglycan alpha,"The SGCA gene provides instructions for making the alpha component (subunit) of a group of proteins called the sarcoglycan protein complex. The sarcoglycan protein complex is located in the membrane surrounding muscle cells. It helps maintain the structure of muscle tissue by attaching (binding) to and stabilizing the dystrophin complex, which is made up of proteins called dystrophins and dystroglycans. The large dystrophin complex strengthens muscle fibers and protects them from injury as muscles tense (contract) and relax. It acts as an anchor, connecting each muscle cell's structural framework (cytoskeleton) with the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell (extracellular matrix).","Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy More than 70 mutations in the SGCA gene have been identified in people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2D. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is a group of related disorders characterized by muscle weakness and wasting, particularly in the shoulders, hips, and limbs. Forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy caused by gene mutations that affect the sarcoglycan complex are called sarcoglycanopathies.The most common SGCA gene mutation occurs in about one-third of people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2D. This mutation replaces the protein building block (amino acid) arginine with the amino acid cysteine at position 77 in the alpha-sarcoglycan protein, written as Arg77Cys or R77C. The rest of the known SGCA gene mutations are specific to individual families or certain populations.SGCA gene mutations may prevent the sarcoglycan complex from forming or from binding to and stabilizing the dystrophin complex. Problems with these complexes reduce the strength and resilience of muscle fibers and result in the signs and symptoms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. "
1198,SGCB ,sarcoglycan beta,"The SGCB gene provides instructions for making the beta component (subunit) of a group of proteins called the sarcoglycan protein complex. The sarcoglycan protein complex is located in the membrane surrounding muscle cells. It helps maintain the structure of muscle tissue by attaching (binding) to and stabilizing the dystrophin complex, which is made up of proteins called dystrophins and dystroglycans. The large dystrophin complex strengthens muscle fibers and protects them from injury as muscles tense (contract) and relax. It acts as an anchor, connecting each muscle cell's structural framework (cytoskeleton) with the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell (extracellular matrix).","Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy Approximately 50 mutations in the SGCB gene have been identified in people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2E. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is a group of related disorders characterized by muscle weakness and wasting, particularly in the shoulders, hips, and limbs.Some people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2E also develop a heart condition called dilated cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy is a form of heart disease that enlarges and weakens the heart (cardiac) muscle, preventing it from pumping blood efficiently. Dilated cardiomyopathy progresses rapidly and is life-threatening in many cases.Forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy caused by gene mutations that affect the sarcoglycan complex are called sarcoglycanopathies. SGCB gene mutations may prevent the sarcoglycan complex from forming or from binding to and stabilizing the dystrophin complex. Problems with these complexes reduce the strength and resilience of muscle fibers and result in the signs and symptoms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. "
1199,SGCD ,sarcoglycan delta,"The SGCD gene provides instructions for making the delta component (subunit) of a group of proteins called the sarcoglycan protein complex. The sarcoglycan protein complex is located in the membrane surrounding muscle cells. It helps maintain the structure of muscle tissue by attaching (binding) to and stabilizing the dystrophin complex, which is made up of proteins called dystrophins and dystroglycans. The large dystrophin complex strengthens muscle fibers and protects them from injury as muscles tense (contract) and relax. The dystrophin complex acts as an anchor, connecting each muscle cell's structural framework (cytoskeleton) with the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell (extracellular matrix).","Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy At least 14 mutations in the SGCD gene have been identified in people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2F. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is a group of related disorders characterized by muscle weakness and wasting, particularly in the shoulders, hips, and limbs. People with limb-girdle muscle dystrophy type F have SGCD mutations in both copies of the gene in each cell (autosomal recessive inheritance pattern).A small number of people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2F have developed a heart condition called dilated cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy is a form of heart disease that enlarges and weakens the heart (cardiac) muscle, preventing it from pumping blood efficiently. Dilated cardiomyopathy progresses rapidly and can be life-threatening.Forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy caused by gene mutations that affect the sarcoglycan complex are called sarcoglycanopathies. SGCD gene mutations may prevent the sarcoglycan complex from forming or from binding to and stabilizing the dystrophin complex. Problems with these complexes reduce the strength and resilience of muscle fibers and result in the signs and symptoms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. "
1200,SGCE ,sarcoglycan epsilon,"The SGCE gene provides instructions for making a protein called epsilon (ε)-sarcoglycan, whose function is unknown. The ε-sarcoglycan protein is found within the outer membrane of cells in tissues throughout the body, but it is most abundant in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and in muscle cells. Researchers suspect that in the brain the ε-sarcoglycan protein plays a role in the functioning of synapses, which are the connections between neurons where cell-to-cell communication occurs.People inherit one copy of most genes from their mother (the maternal copy) and one copy from their father (the paternal copy). Both copies are typically active, or ""turned on,"" in cells. However, only the paternal copy of the SGCE gene is active. This sort of parent-specific difference in gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting.","Myoclonus-dystonia More than 110 mutations in the SGCE gene have been found to cause myoclonus-dystonia, which is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle twitches in the neck, torso, and arms (myoclonus). Most of these mutations lead to an abnormally short, nonfunctional ε-sarcoglycan protein that is quickly broken down. Other mutations prevent the protein from reaching the cell membrane where it is needed. This lack of functional protein seems to affect the regions of the brain involved in coordinating and controlling movements (the cerebellum and basal ganglia, respectively) and leads to the involuntary movements characteristic of myoclonus-dystonia. It is unknown why SGCE gene mutations seem to affect only these areas of the brain.Myoclonus-dystonia occurs when mutations affect the paternal copy of the SGCE gene. More than 95 percent of individuals who inherit an SGCE gene mutation from their mothers do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. Rarely, individuals who inherit an SGCE gene mutation from their mothers will develop features of myoclonus-dystonia. It is unclear why a gene that is supposed to be turned off is active in these rare cases. "
1201,SGCG ,sarcoglycan gamma,"The SGCG gene provides instructions for making the gamma component (subunit) of a group of proteins called the sarcoglycan protein complex. The sarcoglycan protein complex is located in the membrane surrounding muscle cells. It helps maintain the structure of muscle tissue by attaching (binding) to and stabilizing the dystrophin complex, which is made up of proteins called dystrophins and dystroglycans. The large dystrophin complex strengthens muscle fibers and protects them from injury as muscles tense (contract) and relax. It acts as an anchor, connecting each muscle cell's structural framework (cytoskeleton) with the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell (extracellular matrix).","Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy Approximately 40 mutations in the SGCG gene have been identified in people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2C. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is a group of related disorders characterized by muscle weakness and wasting, particularly in the shoulders, hips, and limbs. Forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy caused by gene mutations that affect the sarcoglycan complex are called sarcoglycanopathies.SGCG gene mutations may prevent the sarcoglycan complex from forming or from binding to and stabilizing the dystrophin complex. Problems with these complexes reduce the strength and resilience of muscle fibers and result in the signs and symptoms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. "
1202,SGO1 ,shugoshin 1,"The SGO1 gene provides instructions for making part of a protein complex called cohesin. This protein complex helps control the placement of chromosomes during cell division. Before cells divide, they must copy all of their chromosomes. The copied DNA from each chromosome is arranged into two identical structures, called sister chromatids, which are attached to one another during the early stages of cell division. Cohesin holds the sister chromatids together, and in doing so helps maintain the stability of chromosomal structure during cell division.","Chronic atrial and intestinal dysrhythmia At least one SGO1 gene mutation has been identified in people with chronic atrial and intestinal dysrhythmia (CAID), a disorder affecting the normal rhythmic movements of the heart and the digestive system. The SGO1 gene mutation that causes CAID replaces a protein building block (amino acid) called lysine with the amino acid glutamic acid at protein position 23, written as Lys23Glu or K23E. Researchers suggest that the mutation may result in a cohesin complex that is less able to hold sister chromatids together, resulting in decreased chromosomal stability during cell division. This instability is thought to cause early aging (senescence) of cells in the intestinal muscle and in the heart's natural pacemaker (the sinoatrial node), resulting in problems maintaining proper rhythmic movements of the heart and intestines and leading to the signs and symptoms of CAID.It is unclear why SGO1 gene mutations specifically affect the heart and intestines in CAID. Researchers suggest that the activity (expression) of the SGO1 gene in certain embryonic tissues or a particular function of the SGO1 protein in the sinoatrial node and in cells that help control the rhythm of intestinal movements may account for the features of the disorder. "
1203,SGSH ,N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase,"The SGSH gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called sulfamidase. This enzyme is located in lysosomes, compartments within cells that digest and recycle different types of molecules. Sulfamidase is involved in the step-wise breakdown of large molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are composed of sugar molecules that are linked together to form a long string. To break down these large molecules, individual sugars are removed one at a time from one end of the molecule. Sulfamidase removes a chemical group known as a sulfate from a sugar called glucosamine when it is at the end of the GAG chain.","Mucopolysaccharidosis type III More than 80 mutations in the SGSH gene have been found to cause mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS IIIA). Most of these mutations change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the gene. All of the mutations that cause MPS IIIA reduce or eliminate the function of sulfamidase.The lack of sulfamidase activity disrupts the breakdown of a subset of GAGs called heparan sulfate. As a result, partially broken down heparan sulfate accumulates within lysosomes. Researchers believe that the accumulation of GAGs interferes with the functions of other proteins inside the lysosomes and disrupts the normal functions of cells. It is unknown why the buildup of heparan sulfate mostly affects the central nervous system in MPS IIIA. "
1204,SH2D1A ,SH2 domain containing 1A,"The SH2D1A gene provides instructions for making a protein called signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) associated protein (SAP). SAP interacts with other proteins called SLAM family receptors to activate signaling pathways that are involved in the control of immune cells (lymphocytes). In particular, it helps regulate lymphocytes that destroy other cells (cytotoxic lymphocytes) and is necessary for the development of specialized lymphocytes called natural killer T cells. SAP also helps control immune reactions by triggering self-destruction (apoptosis) of lymphocytes when they are no longer needed.","X-linked lymphoproliferative disease More than 70 SH2D1A gene mutations have been identified in people with X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP). Some SH2D1A gene mutations impair SAP function. Others result in an abnormally short protein that is unstable or nonfunctional, or prevent any SAP from being produced. The loss of functional SAP disrupts proper control of the immune system and may result in the life-threatening immune reaction to Epstein-Barr virus infection that occurs in this disorder. In addition, cancers of immune system cells (lymphomas) may develop in affected individuals when defective lymphocytes are not properly destroyed by apoptosis. "
1205,SH3BP2 ,SH3 domain binding protein 2,"The SH3BP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose exact function is unclear, although it is known to interact with other proteins within cells. The SH3BP2 protein plays a role in transmitting chemical signals, particularly in certain immune system cells and cells involved in the replacement of old bone tissue with new bone (bone remodeling).Studies suggest that the SH3BP2 protein helps regulate signaling pathways that activate immune system cells called B cells and macrophages. The protein is also involved in the production of osteoclasts, which are specialized cells that break down bone tissue when it is no longer needed. Osteoclasts play a central role in bone remodeling.","Cherubism At least 11 mutations in the SH3BP2 gene have been identified in people with cherubism. Each of these mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in a critical region of the SH3BP2 protein. These genetic changes lead to the production of an overly active version of this protein. The effects of SH3BP2 mutations are still under study, but researchers believe that the abnormal protein alters critical signaling pathways in cells associated with the maintenance of bone tissue and in certain immune system cells. The overactive protein likely causes inflammation in the bones of the jaw and triggers the production of an increased number of osteoclasts. An excess of these bone-eating cells contributes to the abnormal breakdown of bone tissue in the upper and lower jaws. A combination of bone loss and inflammation likely underlies the cyst-like growths characteristic of cherubism. "
1206,SHANK3 ,SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3,"The SHANK3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in many of the body's tissues but is most abundant in the brain. The SHANK3 protein plays a role in the functioning of synapses, which are the connections between nerve cells (neurons) where cell-to-cell communication occurs. Within synapses, the SHANK3 protein acts as a scaffold that supports the connections between neurons, ensuring that the signals sent by one neuron are received by another.The SHANK3 protein is also involved in the formation and maturation of dendritic spines. Dendrites are specialized extensions from neurons that are essential for the transmission of nerve impulses. Dendritic spines are small outgrowths from dendrites that further help transmit nerve impulses and increase communication between neurons.","22q13.3 deletion syndrome The characteristic signs and symptoms of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome, which is also commonly known as Phelan-McDermid syndrome, are caused by a deletion near the end of the long (q) arm of chromosome 22. The chromosomal region that is typically deleted is thought to contain many genes, including the SHANK3 gene. As a result of the deletion, people with this condition have only one copy of the SHANK3 gene in each cell instead of the usual two copies.Researchers believe that a deletion of the SHANK3 gene and a reduction in the amount of SHANK3 protein produced is responsible for many of the features of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome. A decrease in the functioning of synapses and cell-to-cell communication between neurons caused by a lack of SHANK3 protein is thought to contribute to the developmental delay, intellectual disability, and absent or severely delayed speech characteristic of people with 22q13.3 deletion syndrome. "
1207,SHH ,sonic hedgehog,"The SHH gene provides instructions for making a protein called Sonic Hedgehog. This protein functions as a chemical signal that is essential for embryonic development. Sonic Hedgehog plays a role in cell growth, cell specialization, and the normal shaping (patterning) of the body. This protein is important for development of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), eyes, limbs, and many other parts of the body.Sonic Hedgehog is necessary for the development of the front part of the brain (forebrain). This signaling protein helps establish the line that separates the right and left sides of the forebrain (the midline). Specifically, Sonic Hedgehog establishes the midline for the underside (ventral surface) of the forebrain. Sonic Hedgehog and other signaling proteins are needed to form the right and left halves (hemispheres) of the brain.Sonic Hedgehog also has an important role in the formation of the eyes. During early development, the cells that develop into the eyes form a single structure called the eye field. This structure is located in the center of the developing face. Sonic hedgehog signaling causes the eye field to separate into two distinct eyes.","Nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly More than 100 mutations in the SHH gene have been found to cause nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly. This condition occurs when the brain fails to divide into two hemispheres during early development. SHH gene mutations are the most common cause of nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly. These mutations reduce or eliminate the activity of Sonic Hedgehog. Without the correct activity of this protein, the eyes will not form normally and the brain does not separate into two hemispheres. The development of other parts of the face is affected if the eyes do not move to their proper position. The signs and symptoms of nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly are caused by abnormal development of the brain and face. "
1208,SHOX ,short stature homeobox,"The SHOX gene provides instructions for making a protein that regulates the activity of other genes. On the basis of this role, the SHOX protein is called a transcription factor. The SHOX gene is part of a large family of homeobox genes, which act during early embryonic development to control the formation of many body structures. Specifically, the SHOX gene is essential for the development of the skeleton. It plays a particularly important role in the growth and maturation of bones in the arms and legs.One copy of the SHOX gene is located on each of the sex chromosomes (the X and Y chromosomes) in an area called the pseudoautosomal region. Although many genes are unique to either the X or Y chromosome, genes in the pseudoautosomal region are present on both chromosomes. As a result, both females (who have two X chromosomes) and males (who have one X and one Y chromosome) have two functional copies of the SHOX gene in each cell.","Langer mesomelic dysplasia Langer mesomelic dysplasia results from genetic changes involving both copies of the SHOX gene in each cell. Deletions of this gene are the most common change responsible for this condition. Mutations in the SHOX gene can also cause the condition, as can deletions of nearby genetic material that normally helps regulate the gene's activity. These changes greatly reduce or eliminate the amount of SHOX protein that is produced. A lack of this protein disrupts normal bone development and growth starting before birth. The resulting skeletal abnormalities include very short stature, extreme shortening of the long bones in the arms and legs (mesomelia), and an abnormality of the wrist and forearm bones known as Madelung deformity. "
1209,SI ,sucrase-isomaltase,"The SI gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme sucrase-isomaltase. This enzyme is found in the intestinal tract, where it is involved in breaking down the sugars sucrose (a sugar found in fruits, and also known as table sugar) and maltose (the sugar found in grains). Sucrose and maltose are called disaccharides because they are each made up of two simple sugar molecules. Disaccharides must be broken down into simple sugar molecules to be digested properly.The sucrase-isomaltase enzyme is found on the surface of the intestinal epithelial cells, which are cells that line the walls of the intestine. These cells have fingerlike projections called microvilli that absorb nutrients from food as it passes through the intestine. Based on their appearance, groups of these microvilli are known collectively as the brush border. The role of the sucrase-isomaltase enzyme is to break down sucrose and maltose into simple sugars so that they can be absorbed by microvilli into intestinal epithelial cells.","Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency At least 10 mutations in the SI gene have been found to cause congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency. These mutations disrupt the folding and processing of the sucrose-isomaltase enzyme, transportation of the enzyme within the intestinal epithelial cells, the orientation of the enzyme to the cell surface, or its normal functioning. An impairment in any of these cell processes results in a sucrase-isomaltase enzyme that cannot effectively break down sucrose, maltose, or other compounds made from these sugar molecules (carbohydrates). The inability to digest these sugars causes the intestinal discomfort seen in people with congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency. "
1210,SIL1 ,SIL1 nucleotide exchange factor,"The SIL1 gene provides instructions for producing a protein located in a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. Among its many functions, the endoplasmic reticulum folds and modifies newly formed proteins so they have the correct 3-dimensional shape. The SIL1 protein works with BiP, a protein that helps fold newly produced proteins into the proper shape and refold damaged proteins. To start this process, BiP attaches (binds) to a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). When BiP folds a protein, the ATP is converted to a similar molecule called adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Then the SIL1 protein releases ADP from BiP so that it can bind to another molecule of ATP and start the protein folding process again. Because of its role in helping BiP exchange ADP for ATP, the SIL1 protein is called a nucleotide exchange factor.","Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome More than a dozen mutations in the SIL1 gene have been found to cause Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome. Most of these mutations result in the production of a protein that has little or no activity. Defective SIL1 protein cannot remove ADP from BiP. BiP is then unable to bind to ATP and re-start the protein folding process. A disruption in protein folding impairs protein transport and causes proteins to accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum. This accumulation likely damages and destroys cells in many different tissues, leading to poor coordination, muscle weakness, and the other features of Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome. "
1211,SIX1 ,SIX homeobox 1,"The SIX1 gene is part of a group of similar genes known as the SIX gene family. Genes in this family provide instructions for making proteins that bind to DNA and control the activity of other genes. Based on this role, SIX proteins are called transcription factors.The SIX1 protein interacts with several other proteins, including the protein produced from the EYA1 gene, to regulate the activity of genes that are important for normal development. Before birth, these protein interactions appear to be essential for the normal formation of many tissues. These include the second branchial arch, which gives rise to tissues in the front and side of the neck; the ears; the kidneys; the nose; a gland called the thymus that is part of the immune system; and muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles).","Branchiootorenal/branchiootic syndrome At least nine mutations in the SIX1 gene have been identified in people with branchiootorenal (BOR) syndrome, a condition that disrupts the development of tissues in the neck and causes malformations of the ears and kidneys. A few SIX1 gene mutations have also been found to cause branchiootic (BO) syndrome, which includes many of the same features as BOR syndrome except for kidney (renal) malformations. The two conditions are otherwise so similar that researchers often consider them together (BOR/BO syndrome or branchiootorenal spectrum disorders). In some cases, the same SIX1 gene mutation causes BOR syndrome in some members of a family and BO syndrome in others.Most of the known SIX1 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SIX1 protein. Some of these mutations prevent the SIX1 protein from interacting with other proteins, such as the protein produced from the EYA1 gene. Other mutations affect the ability of SIX1 protein to bind to DNA. Both of these functions are necessary for the SIX1 protein to regulate gene activity during embryonic development. When the SIX1 protein is faulty, it impairs the normal development of many tissues before birth. The major signs and symptoms of BOR/BO syndrome result from abnormal development of the second branchial arch, the ears, and (in BOR syndrome) the kidneys. "
1212,SIX3 ,SIX homeobox 3,"The SIX3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in the development of the eyes and front part of the brain (forebrain). This protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of certain genes. The SIX3 protein regulates genes involved in several signaling pathways that are important for embryonic development. Some of these genes are turned on (activated) by the SIX3 protein and others are turned off (repressed).One gene that is activated by the SIX3 protein is the SHH gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called Sonic Hedgehog. Among its many functions, Sonic Hedgehog helps establish the right and left halves (hemispheres) of the forebrain. The SIX3 protein also regulates genes involved in the formation of the lens of the eye and the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color (the retina).","Nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly At least 60 mutations in the SIX3 gene have been found to cause nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly. This condition occurs when the brain fails to divide into two hemispheres during early development. SIX3 gene mutations are the third most common cause of nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly. Although mutations in this gene can cause mild to severe forms of the condition, they tend to result in more severe signs and symptoms than mutations in other genes that cause nonsyndromic holoprosencephalySIX3 gene mutations change the structure of the SIX3 protein in different ways; however, all of them disrupt the protein's ability to bind with DNA. As a result, the genes involved in normal eye and forebrain development are not properly activated or repressed. Without the correct activity of these genes, the eyes will not form normally and the brain does not separate into two hemispheres. The signs and symptoms of nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly are caused by abnormal development of the brain and face. "
1213,SIX5 ,SIX homeobox 5,"The SIX5 gene is part of a group of similar genes known as the SIX gene family. Genes in this family provide instructions for making proteins that bind to DNA and control the activity of other genes. Based on this role, SIX proteins are called transcription factors.The SIX5 protein interacts with several other proteins, including the protein produced from the EYA1 gene, to regulate the activity of genes that are important for normal development. Before birth, these protein interactions appear to be essential for the normal formation of many tissues. These include the second branchial arch, which gives rise to tissues in the front and side of the neck; the ears; and the kidneys. Researchers have also found the SIX5 protein in the adult brain, heart, eyes, and muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles).","Branchiootorenal/branchiootic syndrome At least four mutations in the SIX5 gene have been found in people with branchiootorenal (BOR) syndrome, a condition that disrupts the development of tissues in the neck and causes malformations of the ears and kidneys. BOR syndrome is considered part of a disease spectrum with a condition known as branchiootic (BO) syndrome, which has many of the same features as BOR syndrome except for kidney (renal) malformations.Researchers now question whether mutations in the SIX5 gene cause BOR syndrome. Some affected individuals originally reported to have mutations in this gene were later found to have mutations in the EYA1 gene as well. Researchers suspect that the EYA1 gene mutations may be the actual cause of the condition in these people.Each of the identified SIX5 gene mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the SIX5 protein, which alters this protein's interactions with the protein produced from the EYA1 gene. Because this protein interaction is necessary for the activation of certain genes during embryonic development, it is possible that the altered SIX5 protein disrupts development before birth. The major signs and symptoms of BOR syndrome result from abnormal development of the second branchial arch, ears, and kidneys. "
1214,SKI ,SKI proto-oncogene,"The SKI gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in a signaling pathway that transmits chemical signals from the cell surface to the nucleus. This pathway, called the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) pathway, allows the environment outside the cell to affect how the cell produces other proteins. It helps regulate cell growth and division (proliferation), the process by which cells mature to carry out special functions (differentiation), cell movement (motility), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). Through this pathway, a group of proteins called the SMAD complex is turned on (activated). The activated SMAD protein complex moves to the cell nucleus and attaches (binds) to specific areas of DNA to control the activity of particular genes, which help regulate various cellular processes.The SKI protein controls the activity of the TGF-β pathway by binding to certain SMAD proteins, which interrupts signaling through the pathway. SKI protein binding within the cell can keep the SMAD protein complex from entering the nucleus, so it is unable to activate genes. Binding of the SKI protein can also occur in the nucleus. Although the SMAD complex binds to DNA, the SKI protein attracts other proteins (corepressors) that block its ability to turn genes on.The SKI protein is found in many cell types throughout the body and appears to play a role in the development of many tissues, including the skull, other bones, skin, and brain.","Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome At least 10 mutations in the SKI gene have been found in people with Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome, a condition characterized by distinctive facial features, skeletal abnormalities, and intellectual disability. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SKI protein. Many of the mutations alter the region of the SKI protein that binds to SMAD proteins. It is thought that altered SKI proteins are unable to attach to SMAD proteins, which allows TGF-β signaling to continue uncontrolled. Excess TGF-β signaling changes the regulation of gene activity and likely disrupts development of many body systems, including the bones and brain, resulting in the wide range of signs and symptoms of Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome. "
1215,SKIV2L ,Ski2 like RNA helicase,"The SKIV2L gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function has not been confirmed. Based on its similarity to a protein in other organisms, researchers speculate that the SKIV2L protein acts as part of a group of proteins called the SKI complex. This complex is thought to be necessary for the function of another large protein complex known as the cytosolic exosome. Within cells, the cytosolic exosome helps to recognize and break down excess or abnormal messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. mRNA is a chemical cousin of DNA that serves as the genetic blueprint for protein production. Studies suggest that the cytosolic exosome's role in getting rid of excess and abnormal mRNA is important for cell growth.","Trichohepatoenteric syndrome At least nine mutations in the SKIV2L gene have been found to cause trichohepatoenteric syndrome, a rare condition that affects many parts of the body. Its major signs and symptoms include chronic diarrhea starting in infancy, hair abnormalities, distinctive facial features, and liver disease. Mutations in this gene likely eliminate the function of the SKIV2L protein. Researchers hypothesize that a loss of this protein's function impairs the activity of the SKI complex and the cytosolic exosome. However, it is unknown how these changes could lead to chronic diarrhea and the other features of trichohepatoenteric syndrome. "
1216,SLC1A3 ,solute carrier family 1 member 3,"The SLC1A3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1). EAAT1 transports a molecule called glutamate in the brain. Glutamate is one of several brain chemicals called neurotransmitters, which allow nerve cells (neurons) to communicate with one another. EAAT1 is found throughout the brain, but it is most abundant in the part of the brain that is connected to the spinal cord (the brainstem) and the region of the brain involved in coordinating movements (the cerebellum).Neurotransmitters (such as glutamate) are released from neurons and relay signals to other cells by attaching to receptor proteins on neighboring neurons. After the neurotransmitters have had their effect, they detach from their receptors and must be cleared from the spaces between neurons. Researchers have determined that EAAT1 is one of several glutamate transporters that clear excess glutamate from these spaces. This process is carefully regulated to ensure that signals are transmitted accurately throughout the nervous system. The timely removal of glutamate is also necessary to prevent a buildup of this neurotransmitter between cells, which would be toxic to neurons.","Episodic ataxia At least one mutation in the SLC1A3 gene has been found to cause episodic ataxia type 6 (EA6). This mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the EAAT1 protein, replacing the amino acid proline with the amino acid arginine at position 290 (written as Pro290Arg). Research has shown that this genetic change likely impairs the ability of EAAT1 to remove glutamate from the spaces between neurons. The impaired uptake of glutamate may overexcite certain neurons in the brain, which disrupts normal communication between these cells. Although changes in signaling between neurons underlie the episodes of uncoordinated movement seen in people with episodic ataxia, it is unclear how altered glutamate transport causes the specific features of the condition. "
1217,SLC2A1 ,solute carrier family 2 member 1,"The SLC2A1 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called the glucose transporter protein type 1 (GLUT1). The GLUT1 protein is embedded in the outer membrane surrounding cells, where it transports a simple sugar called glucose into cells from the blood or from other cells for use as fuel.In the brain, the GLUT1 protein is involved in moving glucose, which is the brain's main energy source, across the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier acts as a boundary between tiny blood vessels (capillaries) and the surrounding brain tissue; it protects the brain's delicate nerve tissue by preventing many other types of molecules from entering the brain. The GLUT1 protein also moves glucose between cells in the brain called glia, which protect and maintain nerve cells (neurons).","GLUT1 deficiency syndrome More than 150 SLC2A1 gene mutations have been reported in people with GLUT1 deficiency syndrome. This disorder leads to a variety of neurological symptoms that can include developmental delay, intellectual disability, movement problems, and frequent seizures (epilepsy). The mutations that cause GLUT1 deficiency syndrome reduce or eliminate the function of the GLUT1 protein. Having less functional GLUT1 protein reduces the amount of glucose available to brain cells, which affects brain development and function. "
1218,SLC2A9 ,solute carrier family 2 member 9,"The SLC2A9 gene provides instructions for making a protein called glucose transporter 9 (GLUT9). This protein is found mainly in the kidneys, specifically in structures called proximal tubules. These structures help to reabsorb needed nutrients, water, and other materials into the blood and excrete unneeded substances into the urine. Within the proximal tubules, the GLUT9 protein helps reabsorb or excrete a substance called urate. Urate is a byproduct of certain normal biochemical reactions in the body. In the bloodstream it acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from the damaging effects of unstable molecules called free radicals. When more urate is needed in the body, the GLUT9 protein helps reabsorb it into the bloodstream. Most urate that is filtered through the kidneys is reabsorbed into the bloodstream; about 10 percent is released into urine.The GLUT9 protein also plays a role in reabsorbing and excreting the simple sugar glucose.","Renal hypouricemia At least 17 mutations in the SLC2A9 gene have been found to cause renal hypouricemia. This condition results in a reduced amount of urate in the blood. Renal hypouricemia often does not cause any health problems but can lead to kidney stones, blood in the urine (hematuria), or pain and nausea after exercise. Most of the mutations that cause renal hypouricemia replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the GLUT9 protein and severely reduce or eliminate the protein's ability to reabsorb urate into the bloodstream. As a result, an excessive amount of urate is lost through the urine. While it is not clear how these changes in urate levels lead to the signs and symptoms of renal hypouricemia, it is likely that the loss of urate's antioxidant properties in combination with the increase in urate passing through the kidneys to be released in the urine contribute to the characteristic features of this condition. "
1219,SLC2A10 ,solute carrier family 2 member 10,"The SLC2A10 gene provides instructions for making a protein called GLUT10. GLUT10 is classified as a glucose transporter; this type of protein moves the simple sugar glucose across cell membranes and helps maintain proper levels of glucose within cells. However, GLUT10 has some structural differences from other glucose transporters, and its role in the movement of glucose or other substances is unclear.The level of GLUT10 appears to be involved in the regulation of a process called the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway. This pathway is involved in cell growth and division (proliferation) and the process by which cells mature to carry out special functions (differentiation). The TGF-β signaling pathway is also involved in bone and blood vessel development and the formation of the extracellular matrix, an intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells and defines the structure and properties of connective tissues. Connective tissue provides strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body, including blood vessels, skin, joints, and the gastrointestinal tract.Studies indicate that GLUT10 may also be involved in the functioning of mitochondria, the energy-producing centers within cells.","Arterial tortuosity syndrome At least 23 SLC2A10 gene mutations have been identified in people with arterial tortuosity syndrome, a connective tissue disorder characterized by abnormal curving and twisting (tortuosity) of the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body (arteries) and other health problems.The mutations that cause arterial tortuosity syndrome reduce or eliminate GLUT10 function. By mechanisms that are not well understood, a lack (deficiency) of functional GLUT10 protein leads to overactivity (upregulation) of TGF-β signaling. Excessive growth signaling results in elongation of the arteries. Since the end points of the arteries are fixed, the extra length twists and curves, leading to tortuosity. Overactive TGF-β signaling also interferes with normal formation of the connective tissues in other parts of the body, leading to the joint and skin abnormalities and other features of arterial tortuosity syndrome.Changes in mitochondrial function related to GLUT10 deficiency may also affect cardiovascular system development, but the relationship between mitochondrial function and the specific signs and symptoms of arterial tortuosity syndrome is unclear. "
1220,SLC3A1 ,solute carrier family 3 member 1,"The SLC3A1 gene provides instructions for producing one part (subunit) of a protein made primarily in the kidneys. This subunit joins with another protein subunit, produced from the SLC7A9 gene, to form a transporter protein complex. During the process of urine formation in the kidneys, this protein complex absorbs particular protein building blocks (amino acids) back into the blood. In particular, the amino acids cystine, ornithine, arginine, and lysine are absorbed back into the blood through this mechanism.","Cystinuria More than 120 mutations in the SLC3A1 gene have been found to cause cystinuria. Many of these mutations alter a single DNA building block (nucleotide) or insert or delete a small number of nucleotides in the SLC3A1 gene. These changes lead to an abnormally functioning transporter protein complex, which causes certain amino acids to become concentrated in the urine. Cystine is the only amino acid that forms crystals and stones in the bladder or kidneys, leading to the signs and symptoms of cystinuria. "
1221,SLC4A1 ,solute carrier family 4 member 1 (Diego blood group),"The SLC4A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as anion exchanger 1 (AE1). This protein transports negatively charged atoms (anions) across cell membranes. Specifically, AE1 exchanges negatively charged atoms of chlorine (chloride ions) for negatively charged bicarbonate molecules (bicarbonate ions). Based on this function, AE1 is known as a chloride/bicarbonate exchanger (Cl-/HCO3- exchanger). The main function of this exchanger is to maintain the correct acid levels (pH) in the body.There are two versions of the AE1 protein that differ in size. The shorter version is found in specialized kidney cells, called alpha-intercalated cells, that line structures in the kidney called renal tubules. The renal tubules reabsorb substances that are needed and eliminate unneeded substances in urine. Specifically, alpha-intercalated cells release acid into the urine to be removed from the body. In alpha-intercalated cells, the exchange of bicarbonate through the AE1 protein allows acid to be released from the cell into the urine.The longer version of AE1 is found in red blood cells. In addition to exchanging ions, the longer AE1 protein attaches to other proteins that make up the structural framework (the cytoskeleton) of red blood cells, helping to maintain their structure. In red blood cells, the AE1 protein can interact with another protein called glycophorin A, which helps ensure AE1 gets moved (trafficked) to the correct location of the cell. Glycophorin A is not found in kidney cells.","SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis At least 18 SLC4A1 gene mutations have been found to cause SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis, a kidney (renal) disorder that leads to the buildup of acid in the blood (metabolic acidosis). Some people with this condition also have blood cell abnormalities, such as hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary stomatocytosis, or Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (described below). The blood cell abnormalities can lead to hemolytic anemia, in which the abnormal red blood cells are prematurely broken down. SLC4A1 gene mutations cause both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis.The SLC4A1 gene mutations involved in SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis lead to production of altered AE1 proteins that are either stuck inside the cell or trafficked to the wrong side of the cell. In the autosomal dominant form of the condition, gene mutations affect only one copy of the SLC4A1 gene, and normal AE1 protein is produced from the other copy. However, the altered protein attaches to the normal protein and keeps it from getting to the correct location, leading to a severe reduction or absence of AE1 protein in the correct part of the cell membrane. In autosomal recessive SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis, both copies of the SLC4A1 gene are mutated, so all of the protein produced from this gene is altered and not trafficked correctly. Improper location or absence of AE1 in kidney cell membranes disrupts bicarbonate exchange, and as a result, acid cannot be released into the urine. Instead, the acid builds up in the blood, leading to metabolic acidosis. The inability to remove acid from the body also leads to the other features of distal renal tubular acidosis, including soft, weak bones; calcium deposits in the kidneys; and kidney stones.Studies suggest that with the help of glycophorin A, the altered AE1 protein can often get to the cell membrane in red blood cells, which explains why most people with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis do not have blood cell abnormalities. However, some altered AE1 proteins cannot be helped by glycophorin A and are not trafficked to red blood cell membranes. Without AE1, the red blood cells are unstable; breakdown of these abnormal red blood cells may lead to hemolytic anemia. "
1222,SLC5A1 ,solute carrier family 5 member 1,"The SLC5A1 gene provides instructions for producing a sodium/glucose cotransporter protein called SGLT1. This protein is found mainly in the intestinal tract and, to a lesser extent, in the kidneys, where it is involved in transporting glucose and the structurally similar galactose across cell membranes. Glucose and galactose are called simple sugars, or monosaccharides. They are obtained directly from the diet and from the breakdown of larger sugars and carbohydrates.The sodium/glucose cotransporter protein is important in the functioning of the intestinal epithelial cells, which are cells that line the walls of the intestine. These cells have fingerlike projections called microvilli that absorb nutrients from food as it passes through the intestine. Based on their appearance, groups of these microvilli are known collectively as the brush border. The sodium/glucose cotransporter protein is involved in the process of using energy to move glucose and galactose across the brush border membrane for absorption, a mechanism called active transport. Sodium and water are transported across the brush border along with the sugars in this process.","Glucose-galactose malabsorption More than 40 mutations that cause glucose-galactose malabsorption have been identified in the SLC5A1 gene. Some mutations result in a protein that is too short and does not function. Other mutations result in a protein that is of normal length but that is not folded properly, preventing it from being moved to the cell membrane where it is needed.Mutations that prevent the sodium/glucose cotransporter protein from performing its function result in a buildup of glucose and galactose in the intestinal tract. This failure of active transport prevents the glucose and galactose from being absorbed and providing nourishment to the body. In addition, the water that normally would have been transported across the brush border with the sugar instead remains in the intestinal tract to be excreted with the stool, resulting in dehydration of the body's tissues and severe diarrhea. "
1223,SLC5A5 ,solute carrier family 5 member 5,"The SLC5A5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called sodium (Na)-iodide symporter or NIS. This protein transports iodide, a negatively charged version of iodine, into cells of certain tissues. The NIS protein is found primarily in the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped tissue in the lower neck. The thyroid gland produces and releases iodide-containing thyroid hormones that play an important role in regulating growth, brain development, and the rate of chemical reactions in the body (metabolism). The NIS protein supports an efficient system that ensures iodine from the diet accumulates in the thyroid gland for the production of thyroid hormones. This system depends on the NIS protein being positioned in the cell membrane, so it can transport iodide from the bloodstream into particular thyroid cells called follicular cells.In addition to the thyroid gland, the NIS protein is found in breast tissue during milk production (lactation), ovaries, salivary glands, certain stomach cells (parietal cells), tear glands (lacrimal glands), and a part of the brain called the choroid plexus. During lactation, the NIS protein transports iodide into the milk to supply breast-fed infants with this critical component of thyroid hormones.","Congenital hypothyroidism Several SLC5A5 gene mutations have been identified in people with congenital hypothyroidism, a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of thyroid hormones starting from birth. About half of these mutations delete part of the SLC5A5 gene or disrupt protein production, resulting in an abnormally small, nonfunctional protein. The remaining mutations change one of the building blocks (amino acids) used to make the NIS protein. Some amino acid substitutions prevent the NIS protein from being positioned in the cell membrane, disabling iodide transport. Other amino acid substitutions do not affect the membrane location of the NIS protein but change the protein's 3-dimensional shape, which impairs its function.SLC5A5 gene mutations reduce or prevent iodide transport. As a result, the thyroid gland cannot accumulate iodide efficiently, which decreases the production of thyroid hormones. The signs and symptoms of congenital hypothyroidism associated with these gene mutations range from mild to severe depending on the level of hormone production remaining. In many cases, the thyroid gland is enlarged (goiter) in an attempt to compensate for reduced hormone production. Because cases caused by SLC5A5 gene mutations are due to a disruption of thyroid hormone synthesis, they are classified as thyroid dyshormonogenesis. "
1224,SLC6A3 ,solute carrier family 6 member 3,"The SLC6A3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called the dopamine transporter or DAT. This protein is embedded in the membrane of certain nerve cells (neurons) in the brain, where it transports a molecule called dopamine into the cell. Dopamine is a chemical messenger (neurotransmitter) that relays signals from one neuron to another. Dopamine has many important functions, including playing complex roles in thought (cognition), motivation, behavior, and control of movement.To transmit signals, dopamine is released into the space between neurons (the synaptic cleft), where it attaches (binds) to receptors on the surface of neighboring neurons. The dopamine transporter brings dopamine from the synaptic cleft back into neurons for reuse. The activity of the transporter determines how much dopamine is present in the synaptic cleft and for how long. This activity makes the transporter a major controller of dopamine signaling in the brain.","Dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome At least 19 mutations in the SLC6A3 gene have been identified in people with dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome, a rare movement disorder that worsens over time. Its signs and symptoms usually begin in infancy but can appear in childhood or later. Some of the mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the dopamine transporter protein. Others lead to the production of an abnormally short protein or prevent cells from producing any functional protein. All of these mutations impair the function of the dopamine transporter. Because the impaired transporter cannot carry dopamine out of the synaptic cleft and back into neurons, dopamine builds up in the spaces around neurons. The excess dopamine alters signaling between neurons and may suppress (inhibit) pathways that normally trigger the production of more dopamine. Although dopamine has a critical role in controlling movement, it is unclear how altered dopamine signaling causes the specific movement abnormalities found in people with dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome.Studies suggest that the age at which signs and symptoms appear is related to how severely the function of the dopamine transporter is affected. Affected individuals who develop movement problems starting in infancy most often have transporter activity that is less than 5 percent of normal. Those whose movement problems appear in childhood or later tend to have somewhat higher levels of transporter activity, although they are still lower than normal. Researchers speculate that higher levels of transporter activity may delay the onset of the disease in these individuals. "
1225,SLC6A8 ,solute carrier family 6 member 8,The SLC6A8 gene provides instructions for making a protein called sodium- and chloride-dependent creatine transporter 1. This protein transports the compound creatine into cells. Creatine is needed for the body to store and use energy properly.,"X-linked creatine deficiency At least 80 mutations in the SLC6A8 gene have been identified in people with X-linked creatine deficiency, a disorder that causes intellectual disability, behavioral problems, seizures, and muscle weakness. SLC6A8 gene mutations impair the ability of the transporter protein to bring creatine into cells, resulting in a creatine shortage (deficiency). The effects of creatine deficiency are most severe in organs and tissues that require large amounts of energy, especially the brain. "
1226,SLC6A19 ,solute carrier family 6 member 19,"The SLC6A19 gene provides instructions for making a protein called system B(0) neutral amino acid transporter 1 (B0AT1). This protein transports certain protein building blocks (amino acids), namely those with a neutral charge, into cells. B0AT1 is found primarily in the membrane of intestinal cells that make up the brush border, which lines the walls of the intestine and absorbs nutrients from food. B0AT1 transports the neutral amino acids from food into intestinal cells; from there the amino acids are released into the bloodstream to be used by the body. B0AT1 is also found in the membrane of kidney cells, specifically in cells of the proximal tubules, which are structures that help to reabsorb nutrients and other materials into the blood and excrete unneeded substances into the urine. In the kidneys, B0AT1 reabsorbs neutral amino acids into the bloodstream so they are not released in urine.","Hartnup disease At least 23 mutations in the SLC6A19 gene have been found to cause Hartnup disease. This condition is characterized by increased levels of amino acids in the urine (aminoaciduria). Some individuals have episodes during which they exhibit skin rashes or movement or cognitive problems. Most of the mutations that cause Hartnup disease change single amino acids in the B0AT1 protein, reducing its activity. A mutation that has been identified in multiple affected families replaces the amino acid aspartic acid with the amino acid asparagine at position 173 in the protein (written as Asp173Asn or D173N).The reduced B0AT1 activity leads to large amounts of neutral amino acids being removed from the body as waste. As a result, affected individuals are lacking (deficient) in certain amino acids and vitamins. Most affected people get the nutrients they need from a well-balanced diet. However, some individuals are nutrient-deficient due to their diet, illness, stress, or a variety of other reasons and can develop skin rashes or movement or psychiatric problems. Researchers believe that many of these features are related to a deficiency of vitamin B3 (niacin) and one of its main components, the amino acid tryptophan. "
1227,SLC7A7 ,solute carrier family 7 member 7,"The SLC7A7 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called y+L amino acid transporter 1 (y+LAT-1), which is involved in transporting certain building blocks of protein (amino acids), namely lysine, arginine, and ornithine. The transportation of amino acids from the small intestines and kidneys to the rest of the body is necessary for the body to be able to use proteins. The y+LAT-1 protein forms one part (the light subunit) of a complex called the heterodimeric cationic amino acid transporter. This subunit is responsible for binding to the amino acids that are transported.","Lysinuric protein intolerance More than 40 mutations in the SLC7A7 gene have been found to cause lysinuric protein intolerance. All of these mutations impair the y+LAT-1 protein's ability to transport amino acids. People with lysinuric protein intolerance who are of Finnish descent typically have the same mutation. This mutation (written as IVS6-2A>T) disrupts the way the gene's instructions are used to make the y+LAT-1 protein, causing the protein to be misplaced in the cell.Mutations in the y+LAT-1 protein disrupt the transportation of amino acids, leading to a shortage of lysine, arginine, and ornithine in the body and an abnormally large amount of these amino acids in urine. The abnormal transportation and shortage of these amino acids in various tissues of the body leads to the signs and symptoms of lysinuric protein intolerance. "
1228,SLC7A9 ,solute carrier family 7 member 9,"The SLC7A9 gene provides instructions for producing one part (subunit) of a protein made primarily in the kidneys. This subunit joins with another protein subunit, produced from the SLC3A1 gene, to form a transporter protein complex. During the process of urine formation in the kidneys, this protein complex absorbs particular protein building blocks (amino acids) back into the blood. In particular, the amino acids cystine, ornithine, arginine, and lysine are absorbed back into the blood through this mechanism.","Cystinuria At least 95 mutations in the SLC7A9 gene have been found to cause cystinuria. Many of these mutations alter a single DNA building block (nucleotide) or insert or delete a small number of nucleotides in the SLC7A9 gene. These changes lead to an abnormally functioning transporter protein complex, which causes certain amino acids to become concentrated in the urine. Cystine is the only amino acid that forms crystals and stones in the bladder or kidneys, leading to the signs and symptoms of cystinuria. "
1229,SLC9A6 ,solute carrier family 9 member A6,"The SLC9A6 gene provides instructions for making a protein called sodium/hydrogen exchanger 6 (Na+/H+ exchanger 6 or NHE6). Na+/H+ exchangers are found in the membranes that surround cells or compartments within cells. These proteins act as channels that allow positively charged sodium atoms (Na+ ions) into the cell or cellular compartment in exchange for positively charged hydrogen ions (H+, also known as protons), which are removed. The exchange of hydrogen ions helps regulate the relative acidity (pH) of the cell or cellular compartment.The NHE6 protein is found in the membrane of compartments within the cell known as endosomes, which recycle proteins and other cellular materials. The NHE6 protein controls the pH inside endosomes, which is important for the recycling function of these compartments. The NHE6 protein may have additional functions, such as helping to move proteins to the correct location in the cell (protein trafficking).","Christianson syndrome Mutations in the SLC9A6 gene lead to Christianson syndrome. This condition is characterized by neurological problems, including intellectual disabilities, seizures, and an inability to walk or speak. Mutations in the SLC9A6 gene typically lead to an abnormally short NHE6 protein that is nonfunctional or that is broken down quickly in cells, resulting in the absence of functional NHE6 proteins. As a result, the pH in endosomes is not properly maintained. It is unclear how unregulated endosomal pH leads to neurological problems in people with Christianson syndrome. Some studies have shown that protein trafficking by endosomes is important for learning and memory, but the role of endosomal pH or the NHE6 protein in this process has not been identified. "
1230,SLC11A2 ,solute carrier family 11 member 2,"The SLC11A2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). Four different versions (isoforms) of the DMT1 protein are produced from the SLC11A2 gene. Each isoform is specific to one or more tissues, but some form of the DMT1 protein is found in all tissues. The primary role of the DMT1 protein is to transport positively charged iron atoms (ions) within cells; however, the protein can transport some other metal ions as well.In a section of the small intestine called the duodenum, the DMT1 protein is located within finger-like projections called microvilli. These projections absorb nutrients from food as it passes through the intestine and then release them into the bloodstream. In all other cells, including immature red blood cells called erythroblasts, DMT1 is located in the membrane of endosomes, which are specialized compartments that are formed at the cell surface to carry proteins and other molecules to their destinations within the cell. DMT1 transports iron from the endosomes to the cytoplasm so it can be used by the cell.","Hypochromic microcytic anemia with iron overload At least seven mutations in the SLC11A2 gene have been found to cause hypochromic microcytic anemia with iron overload. This condition is characterized by a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) that is apparent at birth. The red blood cells that are produced are abnormally small (microcytic) and pale (hypochromic). There is also progressive accumulation of iron in the liver.Most SLC11A2 gene mutations that cause this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the DMT1 protein. These mutations lead to reduced production of the DMT1 protein, decreased protein function, or impaired ability of the protein to get to the correct location in cells. In erythroblasts, a shortage of DMT1 protein diminishes the amount of iron transported within cells, even though there is an abundance of iron in the blood. As a result, the development of healthy red blood cells is impaired, leading to a shortage of these cells. In the duodenum, a shortage of DMT1 protein decreases iron absorption. To compensate, cells increase production of functional DMT1 protein, which increases iron absorption. Because the red blood cells cannot use the iron that is absorbed, it accumulates in the liver, eventually impairing liver function. The lack of iron in red blood cells and the accumulation of iron in the liver lead to the signs and symptoms of hypochromic microcytic anemia with iron overload. "
1231,SLC12A1 ,solute carrier family 12 member 1,"The SLC12A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as NKCC2. This protein is a Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter, which means that it moves charged atoms (ions) of sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and chlorine (Cl-) into cells.The NKCC2 protein is essential for normal kidney function. The NKCC2 protein works with other transport proteins to regulate the movement of ions into and out of kidney cells. Together, these proteins provide the mechanism by which kidneys reabsorb salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) from the urine back into the bloodstream. The retention of salt affects the body's fluid levels and helps maintain blood pressure.","Bartter syndrome More than 40 mutations in the SLC12A1 gene have been identified in people with Bartter syndrome type I. This form of the disorder is very severe, causing life-threatening health problems that become apparent before or soon after birth.Most of the SLC12A1 gene mutations responsible for Bartter syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the NKCC2 protein. Other mutations delete amino acids from the protein or lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the NKCC2 protein. Each of the known mutations prevents the NKCC2 protein from transporting ions into kidney cells. As a result, the kidneys cannot reabsorb salt normally and excess salt is lost through the urine (salt wasting). The abnormal salt loss disrupts the normal balance of sodium, potassium, and other ions in the body. These imbalances underlie the major features of Bartter syndrome. "
1232,SLC12A3 ,solute carrier family 12 member 3,"The SLC12A3 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as NCC. This protein is a sodium chloride co-transporter, which means that it moves charged atoms (ions) of sodium (Na+) and chlorine (Cl-) across cell membranes.The NCC protein is essential for normal kidney function. It is part of the mechanism by which kidneys reabsorb salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) from the urine back into the bloodstream. The retention of salt affects the body's fluid levels and helps maintain blood pressure.","Gitelman syndrome More than 140 mutations in the SLC12A3 gene have been identified in people with Gitelman syndrome. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the NCC co-transporter protein. These mutations prevent the protein from reaching the cell membrane or alter the protein's ability to transport sodium and chloride ions. Other mutations in the SLC12A3 gene insert or delete genetic material or lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the NCC protein.Mutations in the SLC12A3 gene impair the kidneys' ability to reabsorb salt, leading to the loss of excess salt in the urine (salt wasting). Abnormalities of salt transport also affect the reabsorption of other ions, including ions of potassium, magnesium, and calcium. The resulting imbalance of ions in the body underlies the major features of Gitelman syndrome. "
1233,SLC12A6 ,solute carrier family 12 member 6,"The SLC12A6 gene provides instructions for making a protein called a K-Cl cotransporter. This protein is involved in moving charged atoms (ions) of potassium (K) and chlorine (Cl) across the cell membrane. The positively charged potassium ions and negatively charged chlorine ions are moved together (cotransported), so that the charges inside and outside the cell membrane are unchanged (electroneutral).Electroneutral cotransport of ions across cell membranes is involved in many functions of the body. While the specific function of the K-Cl cotransporter produced from the SLC12A6 gene is unknown, it seems to be critical for the development and maintenance of nerve tissue. It may be involved in regulating the amounts of potassium, chlorine, or water in cells and intercellular spaces. The K-Cl cotransporter protein may also help regulate the activity of other proteins that are sensitive to ion concentrations.","Andermann syndrome At least six SLC12A6 gene mutations have been identified in people with Andermann syndrome. Almost all affected individuals of French-Canadian descent have the same mutation in both copies of the SLC12A6 gene, in which the DNA building block (nucleotide) guanine is deleted at position 2436 (written as 2436delG). This mutation is common in the populations of the Saguenay-Lac-St.-Jean and Charlevoix regions of northeastern Quebec. Most SLC12A6 gene mutations that cause Andermann syndrome result in a K-Cl cotransporter protein that is shortened and nonfunctional.The lack of functional protein produced from the SLC12A6 gene is believed to interfere with the development of the corpus callosum and maintenance of the nerves that transmit signals needed for movement and sensation, resulting in the signs and symptoms of Andermann syndrome. "
1234,SLC16A2 ,solute carrier family 16 member 2,"The SLC16A2 gene (also known as MCT8) provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in nervous system development. This protein transports a particular hormone into nerve cells in the developing brain. This hormone, called triiodothyronine or T3, is produced by the thyroid (a butterfly-shaped gland in the lower neck). Once inside a nerve cell, T3 interacts with receptors in the nucleus that turn specific genes on or off. The activity of this hormone appears to be critical for the maturation of nerve cells, the movement of these cells to their proper locations (cell migration), and the formation of specialized cell outgrowths called dendrites. T3 may also play a role in the development of synapses, which are junctions between nerve cells where cell-to-cell communication occurs.In addition to the nervous system, T3 is produced in the liver, kidney, heart, and several other tissues. T3 and other forms of thyroid hormone help regulate the development of many organs and control the rate of chemical reactions in the body (metabolism).","Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome At least a dozen mutations in the SLC16A2 gene have been identified in people with the characteristic features of Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome. Some of these mutations insert or delete genetic material in the gene. Other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make the SLC16A2 protein. All of these genetic changes alter the structure and function of this protein, preventing it from transporting T3 into nerve cells effectively. A lack of this critical hormone in certain parts of the brain disrupts normal brain development, resulting in intellectual disability and problems with movement.If T3 is not taken up by nerve cells, excess amounts of this hormone continue to circulate in the bloodstream. An increase in circulating T3 may be toxic to some organs, such as the liver. Researchers are working to determine whether increased T3 levels in the body contribute to the signs and symptoms of Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome. "
1235,SLC17A5 ,solute carrier family 17 member 5,"The SLC17A5 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called sialin that is located mainly on the membranes of lysosomes, compartments in the cell that digest and recycle materials. Sialin moves a molecule called free sialic acid, which is produced when certain proteins and fats are broken down, out of the lysosomes to other parts of the cell. Free sialic acid means that the sialic acid is not attached (bound) to other molecules.Researchers believe that sialin may also have other functions in brain cells, in addition to those associated with the lysosomes, but these additional functions are not well understood.","Sialic acid storage disease Approximately 20 mutations that cause sialic acid storage disease have been identified in the SLC17A5 gene. Some of these mutations result in sialin that does not function normally; others prevent sialin from being produced. In a few cases, sialin is produced but not routed properly to the lysosomal membrane.There are three forms of sialic acid storage disease. A particular SLC17A5 mutation, found primarily in people from Finland and Sweden, causes the least severe form of this disorder known as Salla disease. This mutation replaces the protein building block (amino acid) arginine with the amino acid cysteine at position 39 of the sialin protein (written as Arg39Cys or R39C). Other SLC17A5 gene mutations that have more damaging effects on sialin protein function cause the most severe form of the disorder, infantile free sialic acid storage disease. Individuals diagnosed with intermediate severe Salla disease have one copy of the SLC17A5 gene with the Salla disease mutation in each cell, while the second copy of the gene bears a more severe mutation. The severity of signs and symptoms of intermediate severe Salla disease falls between those of Salla disease and infantile free sialic acid storage disease.SLC17A5 gene mutations that reduce or eliminate sialin activity result in a buildup of free sialic acid in the lysosomes. It is not known how this buildup, or disruption of other possible functions of sialin in the brain, causes the specific signs and symptoms of sialic acid storage disease. "
1236,SLC19A2 ,solute carrier family 19 member 2,"The SLC19A2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called thiamine transporter 1. This protein is located on the surface of cells, where it works to bring vitamin B1 (thiamine) into cells. Thiamine helps the body convert carbohydrates into energy, and it is also essential for the functioning of the heart, muscles, and nervous system. This vitamin must be obtained from the diet because the body cannot produce thiamine on its own. Many different foods contain thiamine, including whole grains, pasta, fortified breads and cereals, lean meats, fish, and beans.","Thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome At least 17 mutations in the SLC19A2 gene have been found to cause thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome. Most of these mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional thiamine transporter 1. Other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in thiamine transporter 1, which disrupts the proper folding of the protein or prevents it from reaching the cell surface. All of these mutations prevent thiamine transporter 1 from bringing thiamine into the cell.It remains unclear how the absence of thiamine transporter 1 leads to the seemingly unrelated symptoms of megaloblastic anemia, diabetes, and hearing loss. Research suggests that an alternative method for transporting thiamine is present in all the cells of the body, except where blood cells and insulin are formed (in the bone marrow and pancreas, respectively) and cells in the inner ear. "
1237,SLC19A3 ,solute carrier family 19 member 3,"The SLC19A3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called a thiamine transporter, which moves a vitamin called thiamine into cells. Thiamine, also known as vitamin B1, is obtained from the diet. It is involved in many cellular processes, and is necessary for proper functioning of the nervous system. Molecules made from thiamine are important in the breakdown of sugars and protein building blocks (amino acids). Thiamine is also involved in the production of certain chemicals that relay signals in the nervous system (neurotransmitters).","Biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease At least seven mutations in the SLC19A3 gene have been identified in people with biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease, a disorder that involves recurrent episodes of brain dysfunction (encephalopathy) and a variety of neurological problems that gradually get worse. SLC19A3 gene mutations likely result in a protein with impaired ability to transport thiamine into cells, resulting in decreased absorption of the vitamin and leading to neurological dysfunction. Using medical imaging, abnormalities can be seen in several parts of the brain, including a group of structures called the basal ganglia, which help control movement, but the relationship between these specific brain abnormalities and the abnormal thiamine transporter is unknown. "
1238,SLC20A2 ,solute carrier family 20 member 2,"The SLC20A2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called sodium-dependent phosphate transporter 2 (PiT-2). This protein is highly active in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. It plays a major role in regulating the levels of a molecule called phosphate in cells (phosphate homeostasis). Specifically, the PiT-2 protein uses positively charged sodium atoms (ions) to transport phosphate in out and of cell membranes. Phosphate is needed for many cellular functions including the breakdown of substances (metabolic processes), signaling between cells, and the production of DNA building blocks (nucleic acids) and fats.","Primary familial brain calcification More than 60 SLC20A2 gene mutations have been found to cause primary familial brain calcification. This condition is characterized by abnormal deposits of calcium (calcification) in the brain and movement and psychiatric problems. Most of the mutations that cause primary familial brain calcification change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the PiT-2 protein and severely impair its ability to transport phosphate into cells. As a result, phosphate levels in the bloodstream rise. The excess phosphate combines with calcium and forms deposits within blood vessels in the brain.Although the SLC20A2 gene is active throughout the body, its activity is highest in structures deep within the brain that help start and control movement (basal ganglia) and in other brain regions that are involved in primary familial brain calcification, which may explain why the effects of these mutations are limited to these regions. "
1239,SLC22A5 ,solute carrier family 22 member 5,"The SLC22A5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called OCTN2 that is found in the heart, liver, muscles, kidneys, and other tissues. This protein is positioned within the cell membrane, where it transports a substance known as carnitine into the cell. Carnitine is mainly obtained from the diet and is needed to bring certain types of fats (fatty acids) into mitochondria, the energy-producing centers within cells. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods without food (fasting), fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.","Primary carnitine deficiency More than 60 mutations in the SLC22A5 gene have been found to cause primary carnitine deficiency. Some of these mutations create a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the OCTN2 protein, resulting in an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein. Other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the OCTN2 protein.Mutations in the SLC22A5 gene result in an absent or dysfunctional OCTN2 protein. As a result, there is a shortage (deficiency) of carnitine within cells. Without carnitine, fatty acids cannot enter mitochondria and be used to make energy. Reduced energy production can lead to some features of primary carnitine deficiency, such as muscle weakness and hypoglycemia. Fatty acids may also build up in cells and damage the heart, liver, and muscles. This abnormal buildup causes the other signs and symptoms of the disorder. "
1240,SLC22A12 ,solute carrier family 22 member 12,"The SLC22A12 gene provides instructions for making a protein called urate transporter 1 (URAT1). This protein is found in the kidneys, specifically in structures called proximal tubules. These structures help to reabsorb needed nutrients, water, and other materials into the blood and excrete unneeded substances into the urine. Within the proximal tubules, the URAT1 protein helps transport molecules by exchanging negatively charged atoms (anions) for a substance called urate. Urate is a byproduct of certain normal chemical reactions in the body. In the bloodstream it acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from the damaging effects of unstable molecules called free radicals. The URAT1 protein helps reabsorb urate into the bloodstream or release it into the urine, depending on the body's needs. Most urate that is filtered through the kidneys is reabsorbed into the bloodstream; about 10 percent is released into urine.","Renal hypouricemia More than 30 mutations in the SLC22A12 gene have been found to cause renal hypouricemia. This condition results in a reduced amount of urate in the blood. Renal hypouricemia often does not cause any health problems but can lead to pain and nausea after exercise, kidney stones, or blood in the urine (hematuria). Most of the mutations that cause renal hypouricemia replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the URAT1 protein and reduce the protein's ability to reabsorb urate into the bloodstream. The most common mutation in affected Japanese and South Korean individuals replaces the amino acid tryptophan at position 258 with a premature stop signal (Trp258Ter or W258X), resulting in an abnormally short protein. A reduction in URAT1's ability to reabsorb urate results in a shortage of urate in the blood and an excessive amount lost through the urine. While it is not clear how these changes in urate levels lead to the signs and symptoms of renal hypouricemia, it is likely that the loss of urate's antioxidant properties in combination with the increase in urate passing through the kidneys to be released in urine contribute to the characteristic features of this condition. "
1241,SLC25A1 ,solute carrier family 25 member 1,"The SLC25A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers in cells. The SLC25A1 protein transports a molecule called citrate out of mitochondria in exchange for another molecule called malate, which is transported in. Within mitochondria, both citrate and malate participate in reactions that produce energy for cell activities. Citrate is transported out of mitochondria because it also has important functions in other parts of the cell. In particular, citrate is involved in the production of fats (lipids) and the regulation of glycolysis, which is another critical energy-producing process within cells.","2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria At least 12 mutations in the SLC25A1 gene have been found to cause a form of 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria called combined D,L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D,L-2-HGA). This condition causes severe brain abnormalities that become apparent in early infancy.Each of the known SLC25A1 gene mutations greatly reduces the function of the SLC25A1 protein. As a result, citrate and malate cannot be transported into and out of mitochondria, which disrupts energy production within cells. Through processes that are not fully understood, the lack of citrate and malate transport allows other compounds to build up abnormally within cells. These compounds include D-2-hydroxyglutarate and L-2-hydroxyglutarate, which at high levels can damage cells and lead to cell death. Brain cells appear to be the most vulnerable to the toxic effects of these compounds, which may explain why the signs and symptoms of D,L-2-HGA primarily involve the brain. Researchers suspect that an imbalance of other molecules, particularly citrate, also contributes to the severe signs and symptoms of combined D,L-2-HGA "
1242,SLC25A4 ,solute carrier family 25 member 4,"The SLC25A4 gene provides the instructions for making a protein called adenine nucleotide translocase type 1 (ANT1). ANT1 functions in mitochondria, which are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. This process, called oxidative phosphorylation, converts adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source. ANT1 forms a channel in the inner membrane of mitochondria. This channel allows ADP into mitochondria and ATP out of mitochondria to be used as energy for the cell. ANT1 may also be a part of another structure in the inner membrane called the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. This structure allows various molecules to pass into mitochondria and is thought to play a role in the self-destruction (apoptosis) of the cell.","Progressive external ophthalmoplegia At least five mutations in the SLC25A4 gene have been reported to cause an eye condition called progressive external ophthalmoplegia. This disorder weakens the muscles that control eye movement and causes the eyelids to droop (ptosis). When caused by SLC25A4 gene mutations, progressive external ophthalmoplegia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the gene in each cell is mutated. These mutations impair the movement of ADP and ATP into and out of mitochondria; however, it is not well understood what role these changes play in the cause of the condition.Mitochondria each contain a small amount of DNA, known as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is essential for the normal function of these structures. Although the mechanism is unclear, mutations in the SLC25A4 gene result in large deletions of genetic material from mtDNA in muscle tissue. Researchers have not determined how deletions of mtDNA lead to the specific signs and symptoms of progressive external ophthalmoplegia, although the features of the condition are probably related to impaired oxidative phosphorylation. It has been suggested that eye muscles are commonly affected by mitochondrial defects because they are especially dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for energy. "
1243,SLC25A13 ,solute carrier family 25 member 13,"The SLC25A13 gene provides instructions for making a protein called citrin. This protein is active chiefly in the liver, kidneys, and heart. Within the cells of these organs, citrin is involved in transporting molecules into and out of energy-producing structures called mitochondria. Specifically, citrin carries a protein building block (amino acid) called glutamate into mitochondria and transports the amino acid aspartate out of mitochondria as part of a process called the malate-aspartate shuttle.An adequate supply of aspartate must be transported out of mitochondria to participate in a process called the urea cycle. The urea cycle is a sequence of chemical reactions that takes place in liver cells. These reactions process excess nitrogen that is generated as the body uses proteins. The excess nitrogen is used to make a compound called urea, which is excreted from the body in urine.Citrin participates in several other important cellular functions as part of the malate-aspartate shuttle. This protein plays a role in producing and breaking down simple sugars and making proteins. It is also involved in the production of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA and its chemical cousin, RNA.","Citrullinemia More than 20 mutations in the SLC25A13 gene have been identified in people with adult-onset type II citrullinemia. This condition causes neurological problems, such as confusion, restlessness, irritability, and seizures, usually beginning in adulthood. Almost all of the identified mutations lead to the production of an unstable citrin protein that is quickly broken down or an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the protein.A lack of functional citrin blocks the malate-aspartate shuttle, including the transport of aspartate out of mitochondria. This loss of citrin inhibits the normal production of proteins and nucleotides. It also reduces the amount of aspartate available to take part in the urea cycle. As a result, the liver cannot effectively process excess nitrogen into urea. A disruption in the urea cycle allows nitrogen (in the form of ammonia) and other byproducts of the urea cycle (such as citrulline) to build up in the bloodstream. Ammonia is toxic, especially to the nervous system, which helps explain the development of abnormal behaviors and other neurological problems in people with adult-onset type II citrullinemia.Mutations in the SLC25A13 gene also have been found in infants with a liver disorder called neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD). This liver disorder is also known as neonatal-onset type II citrullinemia. NICCD blocks the flow of bile (a digestive fluid produced by the liver) and prevents the body from processing certain nutrients properly. Ammonia does not build up in the bloodstream of infants with NICCD, and the signs and symptoms typically go away within a year. In rare cases, these individuals develop signs and symptoms of another condition called failure to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency (FTTDCD) after recovering from NICCD. Many individuals with NICCD or FTTDCD have the same mutations in the SLC25A13 gene as people with adult-onset type II citrullinemia. Years or even decades later, some people who had NICCD or FTTDCD develop the features of adult-onset type II citrullinemia. "
1244,SLC25A15 ,solute carrier family 25 member 15,"The SLC25A15 gene provides instructions for making a protein called mitochondrial ornithine transporter 1. This protein participates in the urea cycle, which is a sequence of biochemical reactions that occurs in liver cells. The urea cycle breaks down excess nitrogen, made when protein is broken down by the body, to make a compound called urea that is excreted by the kidneys in urine. Excreting the excess nitrogen prevents it from accumulating in the form of ammonia, which is toxic, especially to the nervous system.Mitochondrial ornithine transporter 1 is needed to move a molecule called ornithine within the mitochondria (the energy-producing centers in cells). Specifically, this protein transports ornithine across the inner membrane of mitochondria to the region called the mitochondrial matrix, where it participates in the urea cycle.","Ornithine translocase deficiency At least 35 mutations in the SLC25A15 gene have been identified in individuals affected by ornithine translocase deficiency, which is characterized by abnormally high levels of ammonia in the blood. This condition can cause extreme tiredness (lethargy), difficulty feeding, problems controlling breathing or body temperature, and seizures in infancy. Affected adults can have episodes of vomiting, difficulty with movements, liver problems, or neurological problems.The most common mutation found in people with ornithine translocase deficiency deletes the protein building block (amino acid) phenylalanine at position 188 (written as Phe188del or F188del). This mutation is seen in 30 to 50 percent of affected individuals and most commonly occurs in the French-Canadian population. Another common mutation replaces the amino acid arginine with a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the protein (written as Arg179Ter or R179X). This mutation is found in about 15 percent of affected individuals and most commonly occurs in Japanese and Middle Eastern populations.Mutations in the SLC25A15 gene cause the production of a mitochondrial ornithine transporter 1 with reduced or absent function. As a result, ornithine transport is impaired and the urea cycle cannot proceed normally. Without a normally functioning urea cycle, nitrogen accumulates in the bloodstream in the form of toxic ammonia instead of being converted to less toxic urea and being excreted. Ammonia is especially damaging to the brain, and excess ammonia causes neurological problems and other signs and symptoms of ornithine translocase deficiency. "
1245,SLC25A19 ,solute carrier family 25 member 19,"The SLC25A19 gene provides instructions for producing a protein that is a member of the solute carrier (SLC) family of proteins. Proteins in the SLC family transport various compounds across the membranes surrounding the cell and its component parts. The protein produced from the SLC25A19 gene transports a molecule called thiamine pyrophosphate into the mitochondria, the energy-producing centers of cells. Thiamine pyrophosphate is involved in the functioning of a group of mitochondrial enzymes called the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. This complex acts on a compound called alpha-ketoglutaric acid as part of an important series of reactions known as the citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle. The transport of thiamine pyrophosphate into the mitochondria is believed to be important in brain development.","Amish lethal microcephaly All known individuals with Amish lethal microcephaly have a mutation in which the protein building block (amino acid) alanine is substituted for the amino acid glycine at position 177 of the SLC25A19 protein, written as Gly177Ala or G177A. Researchers believe that this mutation interferes with the transport of thiamine pyrophosphate into the mitochondria and the activity of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, resulting in the abnormal brain development and the excess of alpha-ketoglutaric acid in the urine characteristic of Amish lethal microcephaly. "
1246,SLC25A20 ,solute carrier family 25 member 20,"The SLC25A20 gene provides instructions for making a protein called carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT). This protein is essential for fatty acid oxidation, a multistep process that breaks down (metabolizes) fats and converts them into energy. Fatty acid oxidation takes place within mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers in cells. A group of fats called long-chain fatty acids must be attached to a substance known as carnitine to enter mitochondria. Once these fatty acids are joined with carnitine, the CACT protein transports them into mitochondria. Carnitine is then removed from the long-chain fatty acid and transported back out of mitochondria by the CACT protein. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods of fasting, fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.","Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency At least 27 mutations in the SLC25A20 gene have been found to cause carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) deficiency. Although these mutations change the structure of the CACT protein in different ways, they all lead to a shortage (deficiency) of the protein. Without enough functional CACT protein, long-chain fatty acids cannot be transported into mitochondria. As a result, these fatty acids are not converted to energy. Reduced energy production can lead to some of the features of CACT deficiency, such as low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and low levels of the products of fat breakdown (hypoketosis). Fatty acids and long-chain acylcarnitines (fatty acids still attached to carnitine) may also build up in cells and damage the liver, heart, and muscles. This abnormal buildup causes the other signs and symptoms of the disorder. "
1247,SLC25A24 ,solute carrier family 25 member 24,"The SLC25A24 gene provides instructions for producing a protein that is a member of the solute carrier (SLC) family of proteins. Proteins in the SLC family transport various compounds across the membranes surrounding the cell and its component parts. The protein produced from the SLC25A24 gene transports molecules across the inner membrane of the mitochondria, the energy-producing centers of cells. This protein is known as an ATP-Mg/Pi carrier because it transports energy molecules called ATP that are attached (bound) to magnesium (Mg) atoms through the mitochondria inner membrane in exchange for adding or removing phosphate (P) atoms from the mitochondria. This exchange is essential for normal energy production, the formation and breakdown (metabolism) of various molecules, and protein production within cells.","Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome At least two mutations in the SLC25A24 gene have been found to cause Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome. This condition, which has been found only in females, is characterized by skull abnormalities that affect the shape of the head and face, a lack of fatty tissue under the skin (lipodystrophy), excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis) on the face and body, shortened bones at the ends of the fingers and toes (short distal phalanges), and smaller-than-normal external female genital folds (hypoplasia of the labia majora).The mutations that cause Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the ATP-Mg/Pi carrier protein. The mutations change the amino acid arginine at position 217 to either the amino acid histidine (written as Arg217His or R217H) or the amino acid cysteine (written as Arg217Cys or R217C). These mutations are thought to alter the structure of the protein, which likely decreases its ability to transport molecules across the mitochondrial inner membrane. As a result, there is an increase in mitochondrial size (mitochondria swelling), breakage of mitochondria into smaller pieces, and an overall decrease in ATP production. This increase in abnormal mitochondria and decrease in energy production can lead to cell death.While altered cellular energy production and increased cell death are likely responsible for the features of Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome, it is unclear how these changes lead to the specific signs and symptoms of the condition. "
1248,SLC26A2 ,solute carrier family 26 member 2,"The SLC26A2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that transports charged molecules (ions), particularly sulfate ions, across cell membranes. This protein appears to be active in many of the body's tissues, including developing cartilage. Cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears.Cartilage cells use sulfate ions transported by the SLC26A2 protein to build molecules called proteoglycans. These molecules, which each consist of several sugars attached to a protein, help give cartilage its rubbery, gel-like structure. Because sulfate ions are required to make proteoglycans, the transport activity of the SLC26A2 protein is essential for normal cartilage formation.","Achondrogenesis At least eight mutations in the SLC26A2 gene have been found to cause a form of achondrogenesis known as type 1B or the Parenti-Fraccaro type. This rare disorder of bone development is characterized by extremely short limbs, short fingers and toes, a narrow chest, and a prominent, rounded abdomen. Serious health problems result from these abnormalities, and infants with achondrogenesis usually die before or soon after birth.Two SLC26A2 gene mutations appear to be relatively common causes of achondrogenesis type 1B. One of these mutations deletes a single protein building block (amino acid) at position 341 in the SLC26A2 protein. This genetic change is written as Val341del. The other mutation deletes three DNA building blocks (base pairs) at a specific place in the SLC26A2 gene. This genetic change is written as c.1020_1022delTGT.The SLC26A2 gene mutations that cause achondrogenesis type 1B prevent the production of any functional protein from the SLC26A2 gene. Without this protein, cartilage cells are unable to take up the necessary sulfate ions, and cells cannot produce normal proteoglycans. A lack of these important molecules severely disrupts the structure of cartilage, making it look coarse and spongelike under a microscope. Because much of the skeleton develops from cartilage before birth and in early childhood, SLC26A2 gene mutations prevent bones from developing and growing normally, causing the severe skeletal abnormalities seen in achondrogenesis type 1B. "
1249,SLC26A4 ,solute carrier family 26 member 4,"The SLC26A4 gene provides instructions for making a protein called pendrin. This protein transports negatively charged particles (ions), including chloride, iodide, and bicarbonate, across cell membranes. Pendrin is produced in several organs and tissues, particularly the inner ear and thyroid gland.The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ at the base of the neck that releases hormones to help regulate growth and the rate of chemical reactions in the body (metabolism). In the thyroid, pendrin is believed to transport iodide ions out of certain cells. Iodide is needed for the normal production of thyroid hormones.In the inner ear, pendrin likely helps control the proper balance of ions, including chloride and bicarbonate. Maintaining the proper levels of these ions appears to be particularly important during development of the inner ear, and it may influence the shape of bony structures such as the cochlea and vestibular aqueduct. The cochlea is a snail-shaped structure that helps process sound. The vestibular aqueduct is a bony canal that connects the inner ear with the inside of the skull.Pendrin is also found in other tissues, including the kidneys, liver, and lining of the airways. Researchers are studying the role of pendrin's ion transport function in these tissues.",Congenital hypothyroidism Genetics Home Reference provides information about congenital hypothyroidism. 
1250,SLC29A3 ,solute carrier family 29 member 3,"The SLC29A3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called equilibrative nucleoside transporter 3 (ENT3). ENT3 belongs to a family of proteins that transport molecules called nucleosides in cells. With chemical modification, nucleosides become the building blocks of DNA, its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as ATP and GTP, which serve as energy sources in the cell. Molecules derived from nucleosides play an important role in many functions throughout the body.ENT3 is found in the membranes surrounding cell structures known as lysosomes and mitochondria. Lysosomes are compartments within the cell that use digestive enzymes to break down large molecules into smaller ones that can be reused by cells. Researchers believe that ENT3 transports nucleosides generated by the breakdown of DNA and RNA out of lysosomes into the cell so they can be reused.Mitochondria are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. While most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA (called mitochondrial DNA). Researchers believe that the ENT3 protein in mitochondrial membranes helps transport nucleosides into mitochondria; the nucleosides can then be used for the formation or repair of mitochondrial DNA and RNA, which are essential for proper functioning of the structures.","Histiocytosis-lymphadenopathy plus syndrome Mutations in the SLC29A3 gene cause histiocytosis-lymphadenopathy plus syndrome, which is a group of conditions with overlapping signs and symptoms that affect many parts of the body. A feature common to the disorders in this spectrum is histiocytosis, which is the overgrowth of immune system cells called histiocytes. These cells abnormally accumulate in tissues, often in the lymph nodes of the neck. Buildup of these cells in the lymph nodes causes swelling of the lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy). Other features can include unusually dark (hyperpigmented) skin patches with excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis), diabetes, and hearing loss.The SLC29A3 gene mutations involved in this spectrum of disorders reduce or eliminate the activity of the ENT3 protein. Researchers are unsure how loss of ENT3 activity causes histiocytosis and other features of histiocytosis-lymphadenopathy plus syndrome. They speculate that the resulting impairment of nucleoside transport leads to a buildup of nucleosides in lysosomes and possibly in other cellular structures. The excess nucleosides may be damaging to cell function. A lack of ENT3 activity can also lead to a reduction in the amount of nucleosides in mitochondria. This nucleoside shortage could impair cellular energy production, which would impact many body systems. It is unclear how SLC29A3 gene mutations cause different patterns of signs and symptoms, even within the same family. "
1251,SLC30A10 ,solute carrier family 30 member 10,"The SLC30A10 gene provides instructions for making a protein that transports the element manganese across cell membranes. Manganese is important for many cellular functions, but large amounts are toxic, particularly to brain and liver cells. Excess amounts of the element are normally removed from the body through bile, which is a fluid produced in the liver that is important for digestion and the removal of waste materials.The SLC30A10 protein is found in the membranes surrounding liver cells and nerve cells in the brain, as well as in the membranes of structures within these cells. It protects cells from high concentrations of manganese by removing manganese when levels become elevated. In the liver, the SLC30A10 protein transports manganese out of cells into bile so that the element can be removed from the body.","Hypermanganesemia with dystonia More than a dozen mutations in the SLC30A10 gene have been identified in people with hypermanganesemia with dystonia, polycythemia, and cirrhosis (HMDPC, also known as hypermanganesemia with dystonia 1). This inherited disorder is characterized by high levels of manganese (hypermanganesemia) in the blood, brain, and liver. The disorder causes movement problems, such as involuntary tensing of the muscles (dystonia); an increased number of red blood cells (polycythemia); and liver abnormalities, including irreversible liver disease (cirrhosis).Mutations in the SLC30A10 gene impair the transport of manganese out of the cell, allowing the element to build up in brain and liver cells. Manganese accumulates in a region of the brain that helps control movement, damaging nerve cells and leading to the movement problems characteristic of HMDPC. Damage caused by a buildup of manganese in the liver causes the characteristic liver problems. High levels of manganese help increase the production of red blood cells, so excess amounts of this element may underlie polycythemia. "
1252,SLC34A1 ,solute carrier family 34 member 1,"The SLC34A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called sodium-dependent phosphate transporter 2A (NaPi-IIa), which plays a role in the regulation of phosphate levels in the body (phosphate homeostasis). Phosphate is needed for many functions including the breakdown of substances (metabolic processes), signaling between cells, and the production of DNA building blocks (nucleotides) and fats. The NaPi-IIa protein is located in the membrane surrounding kidney cells, where it transports phosphate across the cell membrane. NaPi-IIa reabsorbs phosphate from urine back into the body when more of the mineral is needed.","Idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia At least 14 mutations in the SLC34A1 gene have been found to cause a type of idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia called infantile hypercalcemia 2, which is characterized by high levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia) and urine (hypercalciuria) and deposits of calcium in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis). Individuals with this form of idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia also have low levels of phosphate in the blood (hypophosphatemia). The hypercalcemia typically causes vomiting, poor feeding, and an inability to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive) in infancy, although some affected individuals do not develop signs and symptoms of the condition until adulthood. Features in affected adults, whether they had symptoms in infancy or not, typically include hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and kidney stones (nephrolithiasis).The SLC34A1 gene mutations that cause infantile hypercalcemia 2 lead to production of an altered NaPi-IIa channel that cannot transport phosphate across kidney cell membranes. As a result, phosphate reabsorption is reduced and phosphate levels in the body are low.Phosphate homeostasis is also controlled by vitamin D. When turned on (active), this vitamin stimulates the absorption of both phosphate and calcium from the intestines into the bloodstream. In an effort to raise the low phosphate levels caused by the loss of functional NaPi-IIa channels, vitamin D is activated. Too much active vitamin D increases calcium absorption into the bloodstream, causing hypercalcemia in affected individuals. The abnormal balance of calcium leads to high levels of the mineral in urine and can result in deposition of calcium in kidney tissue and the formation of kidney stones. "
1253,SLC34A2 ,solute carrier family 34 member 2,"The SLC34A2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called the type IIb sodium-phosphate cotransporter, which plays a role in the regulation of phosphate levels (phosphate homeostasis). Although this protein can be found in several organs and tissues in the body, it is located mainly in the millions of small air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs, specifically in cells called alveolar type II cells. These cells produce and recycle surfactant, which is a mixture of certain phosphate-containing fats (called phospholipids) and proteins that lines the lung tissue and makes breathing easy. The recycling of surfactant releases phosphate into the alveoli. Research suggests that the type IIb sodium-phosphate cotransporter normally helps clear this phosphate.","Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis At least 18 SLC34A2 gene mutations have been identified in people with pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis, a disorder in which many tiny fragments (microliths) of a compound called calcium phosphate gradually accumulate in the alveoli. These deposits eventually cause widespread lung damage (interstitial lung disease) that leads to breathing problems.SLC34A2 gene mutations are thought to impair the activity of the type IIb sodium-phosphate cotransporter, resulting in the accumulation of phosphate in the alveoli. The accumulated phosphate forms the microliths that cause the signs and symptoms of pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis. "
1254,SLC35A2 ,solute carrier family 35 member A2,"The SLC35A2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called UDP-galactose translocator (UGT). This enzyme is involved in a process called glycosylation. During this process, complex chains of sugar molecules (oligosaccharides) are added to proteins and fats (lipids). Glycosylation modifies proteins and lipids so they can fully perform their functions. The UGT enzyme transfers a simple sugar called galactose to growing oligosaccharides at a particular step in the formation of the sugar chain. Once the correct number of sugar molecules are linked together, the oligosaccharide is attached to a protein or lipid.Two versions of the enzyme, known as UGT1 and UGT2, are produced from the SLC35A2 gene. These enzymes differ in only a few protein building blocks (amino acids) and can function together or separately in different areas of the cell.","SLC35A2-congenital disorder of glycosylation At least nine mutations in the SLC35A2 gene have been found to cause SLC35A2-congenital disorder of glycosylation (SLC35A2-CDG). SLC35A2-CDG is an inherited condition that causes neurological problems (such as seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability) and abnormalities affecting other body systems.SLC35A2 gene mutations change single amino acids in the UGT enzyme or disrupt the way the gene's instructions are used to make the enzyme. These mutations can affect one or both versions of the enzyme and lead to the production of an abnormal enzyme with reduced or no activity. Without a properly functioning enzyme, glycosylation cannot proceed normally, and oligosaccharides are incomplete. The signs and symptoms of SLC35A2-CDG are likely due to impaired glycosylation of proteins and fats that are needed for the normal function of various organs and tissues.In some individuals with SLC35A2-CDG, glycosylation becomes normal later in childhood. The cause of this apparent correction is unknown. The restoration of glycosylation in these individuals, however, does not seem to improve the signs and symptoms of SLC35A2-CDG. "
1255,SLC37A4 ,solute carrier family 37 member 4,"The SLC37A4 gene provides instructions for making a protein called glucose 6-phosphate translocase. This protein transports the sugar molecule glucose 6-phosphate from the fluid inside the cell (cytoplasm) to the endoplasmic reticulum, which is a structure inside cells that is involved in protein processing and transport. At the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, glucose 6-phosphate translocase works together with the glucose 6-phosphatase protein (produced from the G6PC gene) to break down glucose 6-phosphate. The breakdown of this molecule produces the simple sugar glucose, which is the primary energy source for most cells in the body.","Glycogen storage disease type I More than 80 mutations in the SLC37A4 gene have been found to cause glycogen storage disease type Ib (GSDIb). Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in glucose 6-phosphate translocase. SLC37A4 gene mutations disrupt the normal functioning of glucose 6-phosphate translocase and prevent the transport of glucose 6-phosphate to the endoplasmic reticulum. If glucose 6-phosphate cannot get to the endoplasmic reticulum, it cannot get broken down and glucose is not produced. Glucose 6-phosphate that is not broken down to glucose is converted to fat and glycogen, a complex sugar that is stored within cells. Too much fat and glycogen stored within a cell can be toxic. This buildup damages organs and tissues throughout the body, particularly the liver and kidneys, leading to the signs and symptoms of GSDIb. For reasons that are unclear, mutations in the SLC37A4 gene also cause a shortage of white blood cells (neutropenia) in people with GSDIb. "
1256,SLC39A14 ,solute carrier family 39 member 14,"The SLC39A14 gene provides instructions for making a protein that transports the element manganese across cell membranes. Manganese is important for many cellular functions, but large amounts are toxic, particularly to brain cells. The SLC39A14 protein is found in the membranes surrounding several types of cells, as well as in the membranes of structures within these cells. The protein is thought to transport excess manganese from the blood into liver cells so that it can be removed from the body through bile. Bile is a substance produced by the liver that is important for digestion and the removal of waste products.The SLC39A14 protein may also transport other elements, including zinc, iron, and cadmium, across cell membranes. The importance of this transport in the body is not well understood.","Hypermanganesemia with dystonia At least five SLC39A14 gene mutations have been found to cause hypermanganesemia with dystonia 2, a condition that begins in early childhood and is characterized by high levels of manganese in the blood and brain (hypermanganesemia), involuntary tensing of the muscles (dystonia), and other movement problems. These mutations impair the transport of manganese into liver cells. As a result, the element cannot be removed from the body through bile. The excess manganese builds up in the blood and subsequently in brain cells, particularly cells in a region of the brain that helps control movement. High levels of manganese damage these cells, causing neurological problems that make controlling movement difficult. "
1257,SLC40A1 ,solute carrier family 40 member 1,"The SLC40A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ferroportin. This protein is involved in the process of absorbing iron that the body receives from food. Ferroportin transports iron obtained from the diet that is absorbed through the walls of the small intestine into the bloodstream. The iron is carried by the blood to the tissues and organs of the body. Ferroportin also transports iron out of specialized immune system cells (called reticuloendothelial cells) that are found in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. The amount of iron absorbed during digestion depends on the amount of iron transported from intestinal and reticuloendothelial cells.The amount of ferroportin available to transport iron is controlled by another iron regulatory protein, hepcidin. Hepcidin attaches (binds) to ferroportin and causes it to be broken down when the body's iron supplies are normal. When the body is low on iron, hepcidin levels decrease and more ferroportin is available to transport iron into the bloodstream so it can be delivered to tissues throughout the body.","Hereditary hemochromatosis Researchers have identified more than 37 mutations in the SLC40A1 gene that cause a form of hereditary hemochromatosis called ferroportin disease, which is also sometimes referred to as type 4 hemochromatosis. This form of the disorder usually begins during adulthood. Hereditary hemochromatosis is a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet. The excess iron accumulates in, and eventually damages, the body's tissues and organs.Almost all SLC40A1 gene mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in ferroportin. Abnormal ferroportin proteins cannot transport and release iron from intestinal or reticuloendothelial cells. As a result, the regulation of iron levels in the body is impaired, resulting in iron overload and damage to tissues and organs in the body that is characteristic of hereditary hemochromatosis. "
1258,SLC45A2 ,solute carrier family 45 member 2,"The SLC45A2 gene (also called MATP) provides instructions for making a protein that is located in specialized cells called melanocytes. These cells produce a pigment called melanin, which is the substance that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color. Melanin is also found in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina), where it plays a role in normal vision.Although the exact function of the SLC45A2 protein is unknown, it is likely involved in the production of melanin. This protein probably transports molecules necessary for the normal function of melanosomes, which are the structures in melanocytes where melanin is produced. Studies suggest that certain common variations (polymorphisms) in the SLC45A2 gene may be associated with normal differences in skin, hair, and eye coloring.","Oculocutaneous albinism More than 20 mutations in the SLC45A2 gene are responsible for oculocutaneous albinism type 4. The most common SLC45A2 mutation in the Japanese population switches a single protein building block (amino acid) in the SLC45A2 protein. Specifically, this mutation replaces the amino acid aspartic acid with the amino acid asparagine at protein position 157 (written as Asp157Asn or D157N). Other mutations, including changes in single amino acids and deletions or insertions of genetic material in the SLC45A2 gene, have also been reported in several populations worldwide. Mutations in this gene reduce or eliminate the function of the SLC45A2 protein in melanin production. Because this protein is important for normal pigmentation, its loss leads to changes in skin, hair, and eye coloration and problems with vision that are characteristic of oculocutaneous albinism type 4. "
1259,SLC46A1 ,solute carrier family 46 member 1,"The SLC46A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT). PCFT is important for normal functioning of intestinal epithelial cells, which are cells that line the walls of the intestine. These cells have fingerlike projections called microvilli that absorb nutrients from food as it passes through the intestine. Based on their appearance, groups of these microvilli are known collectively as the brush border. PCFT is involved in the process of using energy to move certain B vitamins called folates across the brush border membrane for absorption, a mechanism called active transport. It is also involved in the transport of folates between the brain and the fluid that surrounds it (cerebrospinal fluid). Folates are important for many cell functions, including the production of DNA and its chemical cousin, RNA.","Hereditary folate malabsorption More than 10 mutations in the SLC46A1 gene have been identified in people with hereditary folate malabsorption. These mutations cause the substitution of one protein building block (amino acid) for another amino acid in the PCFT protein, or result in a PCFT protein that is shorter than normal. The mutated PCFT protein has little or no activity. In some cases the abnormal protein is not transported to the cell membrane, and so it is unable to perform its function. PCFT inactivity impairs the body's ability to absorb folates from food, leading to the signs and symptoms of hereditary folate malabsorption. "
1260,SLC52A2 ,solute carrier family 52 member 2,"The SLC52A2 gene provides instructions for making a riboflavin transporter protein called RFVT2 (formerly known as RFT3). This protein moves (transports) a vitamin called riboflavin (also called vitamin B2) across the cell membrane. The RFVT2 protein is found at especially high levels in cells of the brain and spinal cord and is important for absorbing riboflavin from the bloodstream into these tissues.In the cells of the body, including those in the brain and spinal cord, riboflavin is the core component of molecules called flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN). These molecules function as coenzymes, which means they help enzymes carry out chemical reactions. FAD and FMN are involved in many different chemical reactions and are required for a variety of cellular processes. One important role of these coenzymes is in the production of energy for cells. FAD and FMN are also involved in the breakdown (metabolism) of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.","Riboflavin transporter deficiency neuronopathy At least 11 mutations in the SLC52A2 gene have been found to cause riboflavin transporter deficiency neuronopathy. This neurological condition encompasses two disorders that were previously considered to be separate: Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome and Fazio-Londe disease. Some of the gene mutations involved in riboflavin transporter deficiency neuronopathy prevent production of the RFVT2 protein. Others lead to production of an abnormal protein with impaired ability to transport riboflavin. It is unclear how these changes lead to the nerve problems that cause hearing loss, muscle weakness in the face and limbs, and breathing problems in people with the disorder. "
1261,SLC52A3 ,solute carrier family 52 member 3,"The SLC52A3 gene (previously called the C20orf54 gene) provides instructions for making a riboflavin transporter protein called RFVT3 (formerly known as RFT2). This protein moves (transports) a vitamin called riboflavin (also called vitamin B2) across the cell membrane. Riboflavin cannot be made by the body, so it must be obtained from the food a person eats. The RFVT3 protein is found at especially high levels in cells of the small intestine and is important for absorbing riboflavin during digestion so that the vitamin can be used in the body.In the cells of the body, riboflavin is the core component of molecules called flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN).

This neurological condition encompasses two disorders that were previously considered to be separate: Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome and Fazio-Londe disease. The gene mutations involved in this condition lead to production of abnormal RFVT3 proteins. Some mutations lead to the production of an altered protein that cannot get to the cell membrane, so it is unable to transport riboflavin into the cell. Other mutations lead to a version of the protein that can get to the cell membrane, but its function as a transporter is impaired. These changes impair the absorption of riboflavin in the small intestine. The resulting shortage of riboflavin leads to a reduction of FAD and FMN. However, it is unclear how these changes lead to the nerve problems that cause hearing loss, muscle weakness in the face and limbs, and breathing problems in people with the disorder. "
1262,SLCO1B1 ,solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1,"The SLCO1B1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1, or OATP1B1. This protein is found in liver cells; it transports compounds from the blood into the liver so that they can be cleared from the body. For example, the OATP1B1 protein transports bilirubin, which is a yellowish substance that is produced when red blood cells are broken down. In the liver, bilirubin is dissolved in a digestive fluid called bile and then excreted from the body. The OATP1B1 protein also transports certain hormones, toxins, and drugs into the liver for removal from the body. Drugs transported by the OATP1B1 protein include statins, which are used to treat high cholesterol; heart disease medications; certain antibiotics; and some drugs used for the treatment of cancer.","Rotor syndrome Mutations in the SLCO1B1 gene are involved in Rotor syndrome. This condition is characterized by elevated levels of bilirubin in the blood that can cause yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). For this condition to occur, individuals must have mutations in the SLCO1B1 gene and a related gene called SLCO1B3. This related gene provides instructions for making a protein called OATP1B3, which has a similar transport function to OATP1B1. In some cases, the condition is caused by a deletion of genetic material that removes parts of both the SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 genes, so no functional OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 protein is made. Most mutations that cause Rotor syndrome lead to abnormally short, nonfunctioning OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 proteins. Without the function of either transport protein, bilirubin is less efficiently taken up by the liver and cleared from the body. The buildup of this substance leads to jaundice in people with Rotor syndrome. "
1263,SLCO1B3 ,solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B3,"The SLCO1B3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3, or OATP1B3. This protein is found in liver cells; it transports compounds from the blood into the liver so that they can be cleared from the body. For example, the OATP1B3 protein transports bilirubin, which is a yellowish substance that is produced when red blood cells are broken down. In the liver, bilirubin is dissolved in a digestive fluid called bile and then excreted from the body. The OATP1B3 protein also transports certain hormones, toxins, and drugs into the liver for removal from the body. Some of the drugs transported by the OATP1B3 protein include statins, which are used to treat high cholesterol; heart disease medications; certain antibiotics; and some drugs used for the treatment of cancer.","Rotor syndrome Mutations in the SLCO1B3 gene are involved in Rotor syndrome.

Without the function of either transport protein, bilirubin is less efficiently taken up by the liver and cleared from the body. The buildup of this substance leads to jaundice in people with Rotor syndrome. "
1264,SLITRK1 ,SLIT and NTRK like family member 1,"The SLITRK1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is a member of the SLITRK family. Proteins in this family are found in the brain, where they play a role in the growth and development of nerve cells. The SLITRK1 protein may help guide the growth of specialized extensions (axons and dendrites) that allow each nerve cell to communicate with nearby cells.","Tourette syndrome Mutations involving the SLITRK1 gene have been identified in a small number of people with Tourette syndrome. One of these mutations, written as del1264C, deletes a single DNA building block (base pair) from the gene. This mutation leads to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the SLITRK1 protein. Another mutation changes a single base pair in a region of DNA near the gene. This change probably interferes with production of the SLITRK1 protein. Although the SLITRK1 gene is active in areas of the brain known to be involved in Tourette syndrome, it is unclear how mutations in or near the gene lead to the behavioral features of this condition. Because mutations have been reported in so few people with Tourette syndrome, the association of the SLITRK1 gene with this disorder has not been confirmed. "
1265,SLITRK6 ,SLIT and NTRK like family member 6,"The SLITRK6 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found primarily in the inner ear and the eye. This protein promotes growth and survival of nerve cells (neurons) in the inner ear that transmit sound (auditory) signals. It also controls (regulates) the growth of the eye after birth. In particular, the SLITRK6 protein influences the length of the eyeball (axial length), which affects whether a person will be nearsighted or farsighted, or will have normal vision. The SLITRK6 protein spans the cell membrane, where it is anchored in the proper position to perform its function.","Deafness and myopia syndrome At least three SLITRK6 gene mutations have been identified in people with deafness and myopia syndrome, a disorder that causes both hearing loss and severe nearsightedness (high myopia). The mutations that cause deafness and myopia syndrome result in an abnormally short SLITRK6 protein that is not anchored properly to the cell membrane. As a result, the protein is unable to function normally. Impaired SLITRK6 protein function leads to abnormal nerve development in the inner ear and improperly controlled eyeball growth, resulting in the hearing loss and nearsightedness that occur in deafness and myopia syndrome. "
1266,SLURP1 ,secreted LY6/PLAUR domain containing 1,"The SLURP1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called secreted Ly6/uPAR-related protein-1 (SLURP-1). This protein is found in skin cells and other cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body. Like other Ly6/uPAR-related proteins, SLURP-1 folds into a particular shape and is thought to attach (bind) to other proteins called receptors to carry out signaling within cells. However, SLURP-1's role in the skin and the rest of the body is not completely understood.Laboratory studies show that SLURP-1 can bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). SLURP-1 specifically interacts with the alpha7 (α7) subunit, which is a piece of some nAChRs. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are best known for their role in chemical signaling between nerve cells, but they are also found in other tissues. In the skin, nAChRs regulate the activity of genes involved in the growth and division (proliferation), maturation (differentiation), and survival of cells. Through its interaction with these receptors, SLURP-1 may be involved in skin growth and development.","Mal de Meleda At least 15 mutations in the SLURP1 gene have been found to cause mal de Meleda, a rare disorder characterized by tough, thickened skin on the hands and feet. On the palms and soles, the thickening is known as palmoplantar keratoderma; the thickened skin also extends to the backs of the hands and feet and up to the wrists and ankles. The SLURP1 gene mutations involved in this condition lead to production of an altered SLURP-1 protein that is unstable and quickly broken down, if any protein is produced at all. As a result, affected individuals have little or no SLURP-1 protein. It is unclear how a lack of this protein leads to the skin problems that occur in mal de Meleda. Researchers speculate that without SLURP-1, the activity of genes controlled by nAChR signaling is altered, leading to overgrowth of skin cells or survival of cells that normally would have died. The excess of cells can result in skin thickening. It is unclear why skin on the hands and feet is particularly affected. "
1267,SMAD3 ,SMAD family member 3,"The SMAD3 gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in transmitting chemical signals from the cell surface to the nucleus. This signaling pathway, called the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) pathway, allows the environment outside the cell to affect cell function, including how the cell produces other proteins. The signaling process begins when a TGF-β protein attaches (binds) to a receptor on the cell surface, which activates a group of related SMAD proteins (including the SMAD3 protein). These SMAD proteins combine to form a protein complex, which then moves to the cell nucleus. In the nucleus, the SMAD protein complex binds to specific areas of DNA to control the activity of particular genes. Through the TGF-β signaling pathway, the SMAD3 protein also influences many aspects of cellular processes, including cell growth and division (proliferation), cell movement (migration), and controlled cell death (apoptosis).","Loeys-Dietz syndrome At least 35 mutations in the SMAD3 gene have been found to cause Loeys-Dietz syndrome type III. This disorder affects connective tissue, which gives structure and support to blood vessels, the skeleton, and many other parts of the body. Loeys-Dietz syndrome type III is characterized by abnormal blood vessels, skeletal and joint deformities, and skin abnormalities. Some of the mutations that cause this disorder insert or delete small amounts of genetic material in the SMAD3 gene, while other mutations result in a change to single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SMAD3 protein. These mutations lead to the production of a nonfunctional SMAD3 protein. Despite a reduction in SMAD3 function, the TGF-β pathway is overactive. Researchers speculate that the activity of other proteins in this signaling pathway is increased to compensate for the lack of SMAD3 activity; however, the exact mechanism responsible for the increase in signaling is unclear. The overactive signaling pathway leads to dysregulated cell proliferation and gene activation, specifically affecting blood vessel, cartilage, and skin development. These changes lead to the abnormalities typical of Loeys-Dietz syndrome type III. "
1268,SMAD4 ,SMAD family member 4,"The SMAD4 gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in transmitting chemical signals from the cell surface to the nucleus. The SMAD4 protein is part of a signaling pathway, called the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) pathway, that allows the environment outside the cell to affect gene activity and protein production within the cell. The signaling process begins when a TGF-β protein attaches (binds) to a receptor protein on the cell surface, which turns on (activates) a group of related SMAD proteins. The SMAD proteins bind to the SMAD4 protein and form a protein complex, which then moves to the cell nucleus. In the nucleus, the SMAD protein complex binds to specific areas of DNA where it controls the activity of particular genes and regulates cell growth and division (proliferation). By controlling these cellular processes, the SMAD4 protein is involved in the development of many body systems.The SMAD4 protein serves both as a transcription factor and as a tumor suppressor. Transcription factors help control the activity of particular genes, and tumor suppressors keep cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way.","Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia At least 27 mutations in the SMAD4 gene have been found to cause a form of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, a disorder characterized by certain blood vessel abnormalities. In particular, some smaller arteries (arterioles) abnormally flow directly into veins rather than into other vessels called capillaries. These abnormalities are called arteriovenous malformations. When they occur in vessels near the surface of the skin, where they are visible as red markings, they are known as telangiectases (the singular is telangiectasia).The form of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia caused by SMAD4 gene mutations is called juvenile polyposis/hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome. People with this disorder have the blood vessel problems associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia as well as an increased risk of developing intestinal growths (polyps) at an early age; the polyps may become cancerous.SMAD4 gene mutations that cause this disorder affect the TGF-β signaling pathway. Disruption of this pathway may interfere with both the tumor suppressor function of the SMAD4 protein and the appropriate development of the boundaries between veins and arteries, resulting in the signs and symptoms of juvenile polyposis/hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome. "
1269,SMARCA2 ,"SWI/SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 2","The SMARCA2 gene provides instructions for making one piece (subunit) of a group of similar protein complexes known as SWI/SNF complexes. These complexes regulate gene activity (expression) by a process known as chromatin remodeling. Chromatin is the network of DNA and proteins that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. Chromatin remodeling is one way gene expression is regulated during development; when DNA is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when DNA is loosely packed. SWI/SNF complexes help with chromatin remodeling by moving parts of chromatin called nucleosomes, which makes DNA more accessible for gene expression. To provide energy for chromatin remodeling, the SMARCA2 protein uses a molecule called ATP.SWI/SNF complexes regulate genes that are involved in many processes, including repairing damaged DNA; copying (replicating) DNA; and controlling the growth, division, and maturation (differentiation) of cells. The SMARCA2 protein and other SWI/SNF subunits are thought to act as tumor suppressors, which keep cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.","Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome At least 50 mutations in the SMARCA2 gene have been found to cause Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome. This condition is characterized by multiple abnormalities, primarily sparse scalp hair, small head size (microcephaly), distinctive facial features, short stature, abnormal fingers, recurrent seizures (epilepsy), and moderate to severe intellectual disability with impaired language development. Almost all SMARCA2 gene mutations that cause Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the protein. These mutations are located within an area of the protein that attaches to ATP and is responsible for providing energy to the SWI/SNF complexes. These altered proteins are able to form SWI/SNF complexes, but these complexes are nonfunctional and cannot participate in chromatin remodeling. Disturbance of this regulatory process alters the activity of many genes, which likely explains the diverse signs and symptoms of Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome. "
1270,SMARCA4 ,"SWI/SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 4","The SMARCA4 gene provides instructions for making a protein called BRG1, which forms one piece (subunit) of several different protein groupings called SWI/SNF protein complexes.

This condition is characterized by delayed development, abnormalities of the fifth (pinky) fingers or toes, and characteristic facial features that are described as coarse. The SMARCA4 gene mutations involved in Coffin-Siris syndrome are germline mutations, which means that they are present in cells throughout the body. The mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in or remove an amino acid from the BRG1 protein. Although it is unclear how these changes affect SWI/SNF complexes, researchers suggest that SMARCA4 gene mutations result in abnormal chromatin remodeling. Disturbance of this process alters the activity of many genes and disrupts several cellular processes, which could explain the diverse signs and symptoms of Coffin-Siris syndrome. People with Coffin-Siris syndrome do not appear to have an increased risk of cancer (see below). "
1271,SMARCAD1 ,"SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, containing DEAD/H box 1","The SMARCAD1 gene provides instructions for making two versions (isoforms) of the SMARCAD1 protein: a full-length isoform and a shorter, skin-specific isoform. The full-length isoform is active (expressed) in multiple tissues, where it regulates the activity of a wide variety of genes involved in maintaining the stability of cells' genetic information. The skin-specific isoform is expressed only in skin cells, and little is known about its function. However, it appears to play a critical role in the formation of dermatoglyphs, which are the patterns of skin ridges on the pads of the fingers that form the basis for each person's unique fingerprints. These ridges are also present on the toes, the palms of the hands, and the soles of the feet. Dermatoglyphs develop before birth and remain the same throughout life. The activity of the skin-specific isoform of the SMARCAD1 protein is likely one of several factors that determine each person's unique fingerprint pattern.","Adermatoglyphia At least four mutations in the SMARCAD1 gene have been found to cause adermatoglyphia, which is the absence of dermatoglyphs on the hands and feet. Because affected individuals do not have skin ridges on the pads of their fingers, they cannot be identified on the basis of their fingerprints. Adermatoglyphia can occur without any related signs and symptoms, or it may be associated with other features, typically affecting the skin.The mutations that cause adermatoglyphia affect the skin-specific isoform of the SMARCAD1 protein but not the full-length isoform. These genetic changes prevent the production of any functional skin-specific isoform from one copy of the gene, which reduces the total amount of this protein in skin cells. Although it is unclear how these genetic changes cause adermatoglyphia, researchers speculate that a shortage of the skin-specific version of the SMARCAD1 protein impairs signaling pathways needed for normal skin development and function, including the formation of dermatoglyphs.

The SMARCAL1 protein can attach (bind) to chromatin, which is the complex of DNA and protein that packages DNA into chromosomes. Based on the function of similar proteins, the SMARCAL1 protein is thought to influence the activity (expression) of other genes through a process known as chromatin remodeling. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. Chromatin remodeling is one way gene expression is regulated during development. When DNA is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when DNA is loosely packed.","Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia More than 40 mutations in the SMARCAL1 gene have been found to increase the risk of Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia. The mutations associated with Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia disrupt the usual functions of the SMARCAL1 protein or prevent the production of any functional protein. People who have mutations that cause a complete lack of functional protein tend to have a more severe form of this disorder than those who have mutations that lead to an active but malfunctioning protein. Mutations in the SMARCAL1 gene are thought to lead to disease by affecting protein activity, protein stability, or the protein's ability to bind to chromatin. It is not clear how SMARCAL1 mutations contribute to short stature, kidney disease, and a weakened immune system in people with Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia. In order for people with SMARCAL1 gene mutations to develop Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia, other currently unknown genetic or environmental factors must also be present. "

1275,SMC1A ,structural maintenance of chromosomes 1A,"The SMC1A gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family. Within the nucleus, SMC proteins help regulate the structure and organization of chromosomes.The protein produced from the SMC1A gene (which is usually called the SMC1 protein) helps control chromosomes during cell division. Before cells divide, they must copy all of their chromosomes. The copied DNA from each chromosome is arranged into two identical structures, called sister chromatids, which are attached to one another during the early stages of cell division. The SMC1 protein is part of a protein group called the cohesin complex that holds the sister chromatids together.Researchers believe that the SMC1 protein, as a structural component of the cohesin complex, also plays important roles in stabilizing cells' genetic information, repairing damaged DNA, and regulating the activity of certain genes that are essential for normal development.","Cornelia de Lange syndrome More than 35 mutations in the SMC1A gene have been identified in people with Cornelia de Lange syndrome, a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body. Researchers estimate that mutations in this gene account for about 5 percent of all cases of this condition.Most of the SMC1A gene mutations that cause Cornelia de Lange syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SMC1 protein. These mutations alter the structure and function of the protein, which likely interferes with the activity of the cohesin complex and impairs its ability to regulate genes that are critical for normal development. Although researchers do not fully understand how these changes cause Cornelia de Lange syndrome, they suspect that altered gene regulation probably underlies many of the developmental problems characteristic of the condition.Studies suggest that mutations in the SMC1A gene tend to cause a form of Cornelia de Lange syndrome with relatively mild features. Compared to mutations in the NIPBL gene, which are the most common known cause of the disorder, SMC1A gene mutations often cause less significant delays in development and growth and are less likely to cause major birth defects.

1276,SMC3 ,structural maintenance of chromosomes 3,"The SMC3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family.

The exported protein, which is usually called bamacan, may be involved in sticking cells together (cell adhesion) and cell growth. Bamacan is a component of basement membranes, which are thin, sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues. Little else is known about the function of this protein outside the cell, but it appears to be important for normal development.","Cornelia de Lange syndrome At least 15 mutations in the SMC3 gene have been found to cause Cornelia de Lange syndrome, a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body. Researchers estimate that mutations in this gene account for 1 to 2 percent of all cases of this condition.Most of the SMC3 gene mutations that cause Cornelia de Lange syndrome either change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SMC3 protein or add or delete a small number of amino acids in the protein.

"
1277,SMCHD1 ,structural maintenance of chromosomes flexible hinge domain containing 1,"The SMCHD1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in regulating gene activity by altering the structure of DNA. Specifically, the SMCHD1 protein is associated with DNA methylation, which is the addition of methyl groups (consisting of one carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms) to DNA molecules. The addition of methyl groups is associated with the turning off (silencing) of genes, so regions of DNA with many methyl groups (hypermethylated regions) tend to have fewer genes that are turned on (active).The SMCHD1 protein is involved in a process called X-inactivation. Early in embryonic development in females, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly and permanently inactivated in cells other than egg cells. X-inactivation ensures that females, like males, have only one active copy of the X chromosome in each body cell. The SMCHD1 protein appears to be involved in the hypermethylation of certain areas of DNA called CpG islands, although the mechanism is unclear. This hypermethylation is critical for inactivation of the X chromosome. The SMCHD1 protein then remains attached (bound) to the inactive X chromosome to help keep it inactivated.The SMCHD1 protein also plays a role in hypermethylation of a region near the end of chromosome 4 called D4Z4. This region consists of 11 to more than 100 repeated segments, each of which is about 3,300 DNA building blocks (3.3 kb) long. The segment closest to the end of chromosome 4 contains a gene called DUX4. Because the D4Z4 region is hypermethylated, the DUX4 gene is silenced in most adult cells and tissues. Little is known about the function of the protein produced from the DUX4 gene; it appears to help control the activity of other genes.The SMCHD1 protein appears to play a role in normal development of the nose, eyes, and other structures of the head and face and seems to be involved in repairing damaged DNA. However, little is known about its roles in these processes.","Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome At least nine SMCHD1 gene mutations have been found to cause Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome (BAMS). Individuals with this rare condition have an abnormally small or absent nose (arhinia), unusually small eyes (microphthalmia), and a shortage of certain hormones that direct sex development (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism).The gene mutations involved in BAMS change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SMCHD1 protein. Researchers are unsure how these changes affect the protein's function and lead to the developmental problems characteristic of BAMS. SMCHD1 gene mutations may lead to abnormal silencing of genes involved in development of the head and face. Problems with nasal development may affect gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, which are nerve cells that control the release of reproductive hormones. GnRH neurons originate in the developing nose and then move to the brain. Impaired development of these neurons could explain hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in affected individuals.Some family members of individuals with BAMS have milder symptoms, such as a reduced sense of smell (anosmia), arhinia without other features of BAMS, or less severe abnormalities of the nose. Researchers suspect that additional genetic factors contribute to the severity of the symptoms, although these factors are not yet known. "
1278,SMN1 ,"survival of motor neuron 1, telomeric","The SMN1 gene provides instructions for making the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. The SMN protein is found throughout the body, with highest levels in the spinal cord. This protein is one of a group of proteins called the SMN complex, which is important for the maintenance of specialized nerve cells called motor neurons. These cells are located in the spinal cord and the part of the brain that is connected to the spinal cord (the brainstem). Motor neurons transmit signals from the brain and spinal cord that tell skeletal muscles to tense (contract), which allows the body to move.In cells, the SMN complex plays an important role in processing molecules called messenger RNA (mRNA), which serve as genetic blueprints for making proteins. Messenger RNA begins as a rough draft (pre-mRNA) and goes through several processing steps to become a final, mature form. The SMN complex helps to assemble the cellular machinery needed to process pre-mRNA. The SMN complex is also important for the development of specialized outgrowths from nerve cells called dendrites and axons. Dendrites and axons are required for the transmission of impulses between neurons and from neurons to muscles.A small amount of SMN protein is produced from a gene similar to SMN1 called SMN2. Several different versions of the SMN protein are produced from the SMN2 gene, but only one version is functional; the other versions are smaller and quickly broken down.","Spinal muscular atrophy Many mutations in the SMN1 gene have been found to cause spinal muscular atrophy. This condition is characterized by a loss of motor neurons that leads to weakness and wasting (atrophy) in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles) that worsens with age. Spinal muscular atrophy has a wide range of severity. There are many types of spinal muscular atrophy that differ in age of onset and level of muscle functioning; however, there is overlap among the types. About 95 percent of individuals with spinal muscular atrophy have mutations that delete a piece of the SMN1 gene in both copies of the gene in each cell. As a result, SMN protein production is impaired. In about 5 percent of people with this disorder, one copy of the SMN1 gene is missing a section, and the other copy has a different kind of mutation that disrupts the production or function of the SMN protein.Researchers suggest that a shortage of SMN protein leads to the inefficient assembly of the machinery needed to process pre-mRNA. A lack of mature mRNA, and subsequently the proteins needed for normal cell functioning, has damaging effects on motor neuron development and survival. The loss of motor neurons leads to the signs and symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy. However, it is unclear why these cells are particularly sensitive to a reduction in the amount of SMN protein. Some research findings indicate that a shortage of this protein impairs the formation and function of axons and dendrites, leading to the death of motor neurons.Typically, people have two copies of the SMN1 gene and one to two copies of the SMN2 gene in each cell. However, the number of copies of the SMN2 gene varies, with some people having up to eight copies. Multiple copies of the SMN2 gene are usually associated with less severe features of the condition that develop later in life. The small amount of SMN protein produced by the SMN2 genes can help make up for the protein deficiency caused by SMN1 gene mutations. Other factors, many unknown, also contribute to the variable severity of spinal muscular atrophy. "
1279,SMN2 ,"survival of motor neuron 2, centromeric","The SMN2 gene provides instructions for making the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. The SMN protein is found throughout the body, with highest levels in the spinal cord. This protein is one of a group of proteins called the SMN complex, which is important for the maintenance of specialized nerve cells called motor neurons. These cells are located in the spinal cord and the part of the brain that is connected to the spinal cord (the brainstem). Motor neurons transmit signals from the brain and spinal cord that tell skeletal muscles to tense (contract), which allows the body to move.Several different versions of the SMN protein are produced from the SMN2 gene, but only one version (called isoform d) is full size and functional. The other versions are smaller and quickly broken down. The full-size protein made from the SMN2 gene is identical to the protein made from a similar gene called SMN1; however, only 10 to 15 percent of all functional SMN protein is produced from the SMN2 gene (the rest is produced from the SMN1 gene). Typically, people have two copies of the SMN1 gene and one to two copies of the SMN2 gene in each cell. However, the number of copies of the SMN2 gene varies, with some people having up to eight copies. The more SMN2 gene copies a person has, the more SMN protein they produce.In cells, the SMN complex plays an important role in processing molecules called messenger RNA (mRNA), which serve as genetic blueprints for making proteins. Messenger RNA begins as a rough draft (pre-mRNA) and goes through several processing steps to become a final, mature form. The SMN complex helps to assemble the cellular machinery needed to process pre-mRNA. The SMN complex is also important for the development of specialized outgrowths from nerve cells called dendrites and axons. Dendrites and axons are required for the transmission of impulses between neurons and from neurons to muscles.","Spinal muscular atrophy Extra copies of the SMN2 gene do not cause spinal muscular atrophy, but they modify the severity of the disorder. This condition is characterized by a loss of motor neurons that leads to weakness and wasting (atrophy) in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles) that worsens with age. Spinal muscular atrophy has a wide range of severity. There are many types of spinal muscular atrophy that differ in age of onset and level of muscle functioning; however, there is overlap among the types. All individuals with spinal muscular atrophy have mutations in both copies of the SMN1 gene. As a result, little or no SMN protein is produced from this gene. The SMN2 gene can help replace some of the missing SMN protein. In people with spinal muscular atrophy, having multiple copies of the SMN2 gene is usually associated with less severe features of the condition that develop later in life. Affected individuals with one or two functional copies of the SMN2 gene generally have severe muscle weakness that begins at birth or in infancy. Affected individuals with four or more copies of the SMN2 gene typically have mild muscle weakness that may not become noticeable until adulthood. Other factors, many unknown, also contribute to the variable severity of spinal muscular atrophy.Researchers suggest that a shortage of SMN protein leads to the inefficient assembly of the machinery needed to process pre-mRNA. A lack of mature mRNA and subsequently, the proteins needed for normal cell functioning, has damaging effects on motor neuron development and survival. The loss of motor neurons leads to the signs and symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy. However, it is unclear why these cells are particularly sensitive to a reduction in the amount of SMN protein. Some research findings indicate that a shortage of SMN protein impairs the formation and function of axons and dendrites, leading to the death of motor neurons. While the mechanism is not clear, it is apparent that increased SMN2 gene copy number leads to an increase in SMN protein production, which improves the function and survival of motor neurons and results in less severe disease. "
1280,SMOC1 ,SPARC related modular calcium binding 1,"The SMOC1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called secreted modular calcium-binding protein 1 (SMOC-1). This protein is found in basement membranes, which are thin, sheet-like structures that support cells in many tissues and help anchor cells to one another during embryonic development. The SMOC-1 protein attaches (binds) to many different proteins and is thought to regulate molecules called growth factors that stimulate the growth and development of tissues throughout the body. These growth factors play important roles in skeletal formation, normal shaping (patterning) of the limbs, as well as eye formation and development. The SMOC-1 protein also likely promotes the maturation (differentiation) of cells that build bones, called osteoblasts.","Ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome At least 12 mutations in the SMOC1 gene have been found to cause ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome, a condition that results in malformations of the eyes, hands, and feet. Most of these mutations likely result in a nonfunctional SMOC-1 protein. The loss of SMOC-1 could disrupt growth factor signaling, which would impair the normal development of the skeleton, limbs, and eyes. These changes likely underlie the signs and symptoms of ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome. "
1281,SMPD1 ,sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1,"The SMPD1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called acid sphingomyelinase. This enzyme is found in lysosomes, which are small compartments in the cell that digest and recycle molecules. Acid sphingomyelinase is responsible for the conversion of a fat (lipid) called sphingomyelin into another type of lipid called ceramide. Sphingomyelin also binds (attaches) to a fat called cholesterol and helps to form other lipids that play roles in various cell processes. The formations of these lipids is critical for the normal structure and function of cells and tissues.","Niemann-Pick disease At least 175 mutations in the SMPD1 gene have been found to cause Niemann-Pick disease types A and B. These types of Niemann-Pick disease are characterized by a buildup of fat within cells that leads to lung disease and enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). Type A is more severe and is characterized by severe neurological impairment in early childhood.SMPD1 gene mutations that cause complete loss of enzyme function tend to cause Niemann-Pick disease type A. In the Ashkenazi (eastern and central European) Jewish population, three mutations are responsible for about 90 percent of all Niemann-Pick disease type A cases. Mutations that lead to the production of an enzyme that retains some activity often cause Niemann-Pick disease type B. A reduction in enzyme activity within cells allows sphingomyelin to accumulate in cells. The accumulation of this lipid causes cells to malfunction and eventually die. Over time, cell loss impairs function of tissues and organs including the brain, lungs, spleen, and liver in people with Niemann-Pick disease types A and B. "
1282,SMS ,spermine synthase,"The SMS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called spermine synthase. This enzyme is involved in the production of spermine, which is a type of small molecule called a polyamine. Specifically, the enzyme carries out the reaction that creates spermine from a related polyamine, spermidine.Polyamines have many critical functions within cells. Studies suggest that these molecules play roles in cell growth and division, the production of new proteins, the repair of damaged tissues, and the controlled self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). Polyamines also appear to be necessary for normal development of the brain and other parts of the body.","Snyder-Robinson syndrome At least four mutations in the SMS gene have been found to cause Snyder-Robinson syndrome, a condition characterized by intellectual disability and bone and muscle abnormalities. The condition only occurs in males. Most of the identified mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the spermine synthase enzyme. All of the known mutations greatly reduce or eliminate the activity of spermine synthase, which decreases the amount of spermine in cells. A shortage of this polyamine clearly impacts normal development, including the development of the brain, muscles, and bones, but it is unknown how it leads to the specific signs and symptoms of Snyder-Robinson syndrome. "
1283,SNAI2 ,snail family transcriptional repressor 2,"The SNAI2 gene (often called SLUG) provides the instructions for making a protein called snail 2. Snail 2 belongs to the snail protein family, which plays a role in the formation of tissues during embryonic development. The snail 2 protein is also found in most adult tissues, so it probably helps maintain the normal function of cells after birth. To carry out these roles, snail 2 attaches to critical regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. On the basis of this action, the protein is called a transcription factor.Research indicates that the snail 2 protein is required during embryonic growth for the development of cells called neural crest cells. Neural crest cells migrate from the developing spinal cord to specific regions in the embryo and give rise to many tissues and cell types, including some nerve tissue and pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. Melanocytes produce the pigment melanin, which contributes to hair, eye, and skin color. Melanocytes are also found in certain regions of the brain and inner ear. The snail 2 protein probably plays a role in the formation and survival of melanocytes.","Piebaldism One copy of the SNAI2 gene is deleted in some cases of piebaldism, a condition characterized by white patches of skin and hair caused by a lack of pigmented cells (melanocytes). Loss of one copy of the gene probably reduces the production of the snail 2 protein. Shortage of the snail 2 protein may disrupt the development of melanocytes in certain areas of the skin and hair, causing the patchy loss of pigment. "
1284,SNCA ,synuclein alpha,"The SNCA gene provides instructions for making a small protein called alpha-synuclein. Alpha-synuclein is abundant in the brain, and smaller amounts are found in the heart, muscles, and other tissues. In the brain, alpha-synuclein is found mainly at the tips of nerve cells (neurons) in specialized structures called presynaptic terminals. Presynaptic terminals release chemical messengers, called neurotransmitters, from compartments known as synaptic vesicles. The release of neurotransmitters relays signals between neurons and is critical for normal brain function.Although the function of alpha-synuclein is not well understood, studies suggest that it plays an important role in maintaining an adequate supply of synaptic vesicles in presynaptic terminals. It may also help regulate the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is critical for controlling the start and stop of voluntary and involuntary movements. Alpha-synuclein may also play a role in the movement of structures called microtubules that help cells maintain their shape.","Dementia with Lewy bodies At least six mutations in the SNCA gene have been found to cause dementia with Lewy bodies. This condition is characterized by intellectual decline (dementia); visual hallucinations; sudden changes in attention and mood; and movement problems characteristic of Parkinson disease (described below) such as rigidity of limbs, tremors, and impaired balance and coordination. A characteristic feature of this condition is Lewy bodies, which are abnormal clusters of alpha-synuclein protein in the brain. Lewy bodies also occur in Parkinson disease, but they tend to be more widespread in the brain in dementia with Lewy bodies.In dementia with Lewy bodies, SNCA gene mutations lead to the production of an alpha-synuclein protein with an abnormal shape. The misshapen proteins cluster together, forming the main component of Lewy bodies. These protein clusters are present throughout the brain where they impair neuron function and ultimately cause cell death. Over time, the loss of neurons increasingly impairs intellectual and motor function and the regulation of emotions, resulting in the signs and symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies. "
1285,SNCB ,synuclein beta,"The SNCB gene provides instructions for making a protein called beta-synuclein. The exact function of this protein is unknown, but it is likely involved in a process called synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity is the ability of the connections between nerve cells (called synapses) to change and adapt over time in response to experience. This process is critical for learning and memory. Beta-synuclein may also prevent harmful accumulation of a similar protein called alpha-synuclein in nerve cells (neurons).","Dementia with Lewy bodies At least two mutations in the SNCB gene have been found to cause dementia with Lewy bodies. This condition is characterized by intellectual decline (dementia); visual hallucinations; sudden changes in attention and mood; and movement problems such as rigidity of limbs, tremors, and impaired balance and coordination.SNCB gene mutations lead to the production of a protein with impaired function. It is thought that this altered protein may not be able to prevent alpha-synuclein accumulation. A decrease in functional beta-synuclein likely results in alpha-synuclein accumulation and the formation of Lewy bodies. These abnormal protein clusters are present throughout the brain, where they impair neuron function and ultimately cause cell death. Over time, the loss of neurons increasingly impairs intellectual and motor function and the regulation of emotions, resulting in the signs and symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies. "
1286,SOD1 ,superoxide dismutase 1,"The SOD1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called superoxide dismutase, which is abundant in cells throughout the body. This enzyme attaches (binds) to molecules of copper and zinc to break down toxic, charged oxygen molecules called superoxide radicals. The molecules are byproducts of normal cell processes, and they must be broken down regularly to avoid damaging cells.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis At least 200 mutations in the SOD1 gene have been found to cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a condition characterized by progressive muscle weakness, a loss of muscle mass, and an inability to control movement. Most of these mutations change one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) in the superoxide dismutase enzyme. About half of all Americans with ALS caused by SOD1 gene mutations have a particular mutation that replaces the amino acid alanine with the amino acid valine at position 5 in the enzyme, written as Ala5Val or A5V. (Because of variations in the ways amino acids are counted in proteins, this mutation is sometimes called Ala4Val or A4V.) ALS caused by the A5V mutation is generally associated with a shorter life expectancy compared with ALS caused by other genetic mutations.ALS is caused by the death of nerve cells that control muscle movement (motor neurons). It is unclear why these cells are particularly sensitive to SOD1 gene mutations. Researchers have suggested several ways in which the altered enzyme may cause the death of motor neurons. These possibilities include an increase in harmful superoxide radicals, increased production of other types of toxic radicals, increased cell death, or accumulation of clumps (aggregates) of misfolded superoxide dismutase that may be toxic to cells. "
1287,SOS1 ,SOS Ras/Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1,"The SOS1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in controlling (regulating) the activation of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, which helps control several important cell functions. Specifically, the pathway regulates the growth and division of cells (proliferation), the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (migration), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). Within the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, the SOS1 protein regulates a protein, called Ras, that stimulates cells to grow and divide. This regulation tightly controls the growth of cells and tissues, and is especially important for proper embryonic development.","Noonan syndrome More than 55 mutations causing Noonan syndrome have been identified in the SOS1 gene. Noonan syndrome is characterized by mildly unusual facial characteristics, short stature, heart defects, bleeding problems, skeletal malformations, and many other signs and symptoms. The SOS1 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SOS1 protein. The resulting protein is either continuously turned on (active) or has prolonged activation, rather than promptly switching on and off in response to other cellular proteins. This increase in protein activity disrupts the regulation of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway that controls cell functions such as growth and division. This misregulation can result in the heart defects, growth problems, skeletal abnormalities, and other features of Noonan syndrome. "
1288,SOST ,sclerostin,"The SOST gene provides instructions for making the protein sclerostin. Sclerostin is produced in osteocytes, which are a type of bone cell. The main function of sclerostin is to stop (inhibit) bone formation. The maintenance of bone over time requires a balance between the formation of new bone tissue and the breakdown and removal (resorption) of old bone tissue. Inhibition of bone formation is necessary to ensure that bones are of the correct shape, size, and density. Research suggests that sclerostin exerts its effects by interfering with a process called Wnt signaling, which plays a key role in the regulation of bone formation. Sclerostin may also promote the self-destruction (apoptosis) of bone cells, further inhibiting bone growth.","SOST-related sclerosing bone dysplasia At least six mutations in or near the SOST gene have been found to cause SOST-related sclerosing bone dysplasia. There are two forms of SOST-related sclerosing bone dysplasia: sclerosteosis and van Buchem disease. Sclerosteosis, the more severe type, is most common in the Afrikaner population of South Africa, while the milder van Buchem disease occurs most often in people of Dutch ancestry.Most mutations that cause sclerosteosis result in a premature stop signal in the instructions for making sclerostin. These mutations prevent the production of any functional protein.The most common mutation that causes van Buchem disease in people of Dutch ancestry is a deletion of 52,000 DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in a region of DNA neighboring the SOST gene. This region, called a regulatory region, normally controls the gene's activity (expression). This deletion within the regulatory region reduces the expression of the SOST gene, leading to a shortage of functional sclerostin protein.A shortage or absence of sclerostin in bone cells disrupts the protein's inhibitory effect on bone growth, causing excessive bone formation. As a result, bones are denser and wider than usual, particularly the bones of the skull. These bone abnormalities are characteristic of SOST-related sclerosing bone dysplasia. "
1289,SOX2 ,SRY-box 2,"The SOX2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the formation of many different tissues and organs during embryonic development. The SOX2 protein is especially important for the development of the eyes. This protein regulates the activity of other genes by attaching (binding) to specific regions of DNA. On the basis of this action, the SOX2 protein is called a transcription factor.",Septo-optic dysplasia Genetics Home Reference provides information about septo-optic dysplasia. 
1290,SOX9 ,SRY-box 9,"The SOX9 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role during embryonic development. The SOX9 protein is especially important for development of the skeleton and plays a key role in the determination of sex before birth. The SOX9 protein attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and regulates the activity of other genes, particularly those that control skeletal development and sex determination. On the basis of this action, the SOX9 protein is called a transcription factor.","Campomelic dysplasia More than 70 mutations involving the SOX9 gene have been found to cause campomelic dysplasia, a disorder that affects skeletal development, sex determination, and other processes in the body and is often life-threatening in the newborn period. Most cases of campomelic dysplasia are caused by mutations within the SOX9 gene. These mutations prevent the production of the SOX9 protein or result in a protein with impaired ability to function as a transcription factor. About 5 percent of cases are caused by chromosome abnormalities that occur near the SOX9 gene. These chromosome abnormalities disrupt regions of DNA called enhancers that normally regulate the activity of the SOX9 gene. All of these genetic changes prevent the SOX9 protein from properly controlling the genes essential for normal development of the skeleton, reproductive organs, and other parts of the body. Abnormal development of these structures causes the signs and symptoms of campomelic dysplasia.Individuals with milder forms of campomelic dysplasia are more likely to have chromosome abnormalities near the SOX9 gene rather than mutations within the gene. "
1291,SOX10 ,SRY-box 10,"The SOX10 gene belongs to a family of genes that plays a critical role in the formation of tissues and organs during embryonic development. The SOX gene family also maintains the normal function of certain cells after birth. To carry out these roles, proteins made by genes in the SOX family bind to specific areas of DNA. By attaching to critical regions near genes, SOX proteins help control the activity of those genes. SOX proteins are called transcription factors on the basis of this action.During embryonic development, the SOX10 gene is active in cells called neural crest cells. These cells migrate from the developing spinal cord to specific regions in the embryo, where they give rise to many different types of cells. The protein made by the SOX10 gene directs the activity of other genes (such as MITF) that signal neural crest cells to become more specific cell types. In particular, the SOX10 protein is essential for the formation of nerves in the intestine (enteric nerves) and for the production of specialized cells called melanocytes. Melanocytes produce melanin, a pigment that contributes to skin, hair, and eye color. Melanin is also involved in the normal function of the inner ear.","Waardenburg syndrome More than 30 mutations in the SOX10 gene have been identified in people with Waardenburg syndrome type II and type IV (also known as Waardenburg-Shah syndrome). Both types of Waardenburg syndrome are characterized by changes in skin, hair, and eye coloring and hearing loss. People with type IV also have an intestinal disorder called Hirschsprung disease that causes severe constipation or intestinal blockage. Most SOX10 mutations lead to the production of an abnormal version of the SOX10 protein or prevent the gene from making any protein. An abnormal or missing SOX10 protein cannot control genes that signal neural crest cells to become specific cell types. As a result, enteric nerves and melanocytes do not form normally during embryonic development. Missing enteric nerves in certain parts of the intestine cause the signs and symptoms of Hirschsprung disease. A lack of melanocytes affects the coloring of skin, hair, and eyes and causes the hearing loss characteristic of Waardenburg syndrome.Researchers have found that mutations in the SOX10 gene also cause a similar disorder known as peripheral demyelinating neuropathy, central demyelinating leukodystrophy, Waardenburg syndrome, and Hirschsprung disease (PCWH). This rare condition is a variant of Waardenburg syndrome type IV that also affects other parts of the nervous system. Like mutations that cause other types of Waardenburg syndrome, the mutations responsible for PCWH lead to the production of an abnormal version of the SOX10 protein that is unable to direct the activity of other genes. "
1292,SP110 ,SP110 nuclear body protein,"The SP110 gene provides instructions for making a protein called SP110 nuclear body protein, which is a component of cellular structures called nuclear bodies. Nuclear bodies are located within the nuclei of cells, where they help control the activity of certain genes. Nuclear bodies are also involved in the regulation of cell division, the self-destruction of cells that are damaged or no longer needed (apoptosis), and the normal function of the immune system.SP110 nuclear body protein is active primarily in immune system cells called leukocytes and in the spleen. It likely helps regulate the activity of genes needed for the body's immune response to foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria).","Hepatic veno-occlusive disease with immunodeficiency At least five mutations in the SP110 gene have been found to cause hepatic veno-occlusive disease with immunodeficiency (VODI). Each of these mutations leads to the production of a nonfunctional version of SP110 nuclear body protein. A lack of functional protein impairs the immune system's ability to fight off foreign invaders, allowing recurrent and persistent infections to develop. It is unclear how the loss of SP110 nuclear body protein disrupts blood flow in the liver, leading to enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly), a buildup of scar tissue (hepatic fibrosis), and liver failure. "
1293,SPART ,spartin,"The SPART gene provides instructions for producing a protein called spartin, whose function is not entirely understood. Researchers believe that spartin may be involved in a variety of cell functions, from breaking down proteins to transporting materials from the cell surface into the cell (endocytosis). Spartin is found in a wide range of body tissues, including the nervous system.","Troyer syndrome One mutation has been identified in people with Troyer syndrome. This mutation deletes a DNA building block (nucleotide) in the SPART gene. Specifically, this mutation deletes the nucleotide adenosine at position 1110 in the gene, written as 1110delA. This mutation results in an abnormally shortened, nonfunctioning spartin protein. It is unclear how this mutation causes the signs and symptoms of Troyer syndrome. "
1294,SPAST ,spastin,"The SPAST gene provides instructions for producing a protein called spastin, which is a member of the AAA protein family. This protein family plays a role in many cellular activities, including regulation of cell components and proteins. Spastin is found throughout the body, particularly in certain nerve cells (neurons). The spastin protein plays a role in the function of microtubules, which are rigid, hollow fibers that make up the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton). Microtubules are also involved in transporting cell components and facilitating cell division. Spastin likely helps restrict microtubule length and disassemble microtubule structures when they are no longer needed.","Spastic paraplegia type 4 More than 240 mutations in the SPAST gene have been found to cause spastic paraplegia type 4. Most of these mutations alter the structure or disrupt the production of spastin, impairing its ability to regulate microtubules. The inability of the microtubules to transport cell components, especially in nerve cells, is thought to contribute to the major signs and symptoms of spastic paraplegia type 4.Mutation in the SPAST gene account for approximately 40 percent of autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegias. "
1295,SPECC1L ,sperm antigen with calponin homology and coiled-coil domains 1 like,"The SPECC1L gene provides instructions for making a protein called cytospin-A. This protein stabilizes components of the cell's structural framework (cytoskeleton) called microtubules, which are rigid, hollow fibers that help maintain the cell's shape. Stabilization of microtubules is necessary for these fibers to regulate various cell processes including the movement of cells to their proper location (cell migration). In order for cells to move, microtubules elongate in a specific direction, changing the shape of the cytoskeleton and allowing the cell to move in that direction. Migration of cells to their proper location during development ensures normal tissue formation.During development of the embryo, cytospin-A plays a role in the migration of cells called neural crest cells, which originate in the developing spinal cord and migrate to specific regions in the embryo to form different structures. Cytospin-A is specifically involved in the migration of neural crest cells that come together to form the forehead, nasal bridge, and lower jaw.","Opitz G/BBB syndrome At least two mutations in the SPECC1L gene have been found to cause Opitz G/BBB syndrome. This condition causes several abnormalities along the midline of the body, including widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), throat malformations that can cause difficulty breathing or swallowing, brain malformations, distinct facial features, and genital abnormalities in males. The SPECC1L gene mutations that cause Opitz G/BBB syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the cytospin-A protein, reducing the protein's ability to interact with components of the cytoskeleton. As a result, microtubules are disorganized and cells have trouble migrating to their proper location. Because the SPECC1L gene plays a role in facial development, mutations in this gene likely account for an opening in the lip (cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) seen in some individuals with Opitz G/BBB syndrome. However, it is unclear how SPECC1L gene mutations cause the other features of this disorder. "
1296,SPG7 ,"SPG7, paraplegin matrix AAA peptidase subunit","The SPG7 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called paraplegin, which is a member of the AAA protein family. This protein family plays a role in many cellular activities, including regulation of cell components and proteins. Located within the inner membrane of the energy-producing centers of cells (mitochondria), paraplegin is one of the proteins that form a complex called the m-AAA protease. The m-AAA protease is responsible for assembling ribosomes (cellular structures that process the cell's genetic instructions to create proteins) and removing nonfunctional proteins in the mitochondria.","Spastic paraplegia type 7 More than 10 mutations that cause spastic paraplegia type 7 have been found. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the protein paraplegin. When paraplegin is mutated, it cannot organize with other proteins within the mitochondria to form the m-AAA protease. The buildup of unusable proteins in nerve cells, caused by the nonfunctional m-AAA protease, can impair mitochondrial functioning and diminish nerve cell signaling, leading to the major signs and symptoms of spastic paraplegia type 7. "
1297,SPG11 ,"SPG11, spatacsin vesicle trafficking associated","The SPG11 gene provides instructions for making the protein spatacsin. Spatacsin is active (expressed) throughout the nervous system, although its exact function is unknown. Researchers speculate that it may help control the activity of particular genes (gene expression) or play a role in the transport (trafficking) of proteins. Spatacsin may also be involved in the maintenance of axons, which are specialized extensions of nerve cells (neurons) that transmit impulses throughout the nervous system.",Spastic paraplegia type 11 More than 65 mutations in the SPG11 gene have been found to cause spastic paraplegia type 11. Most of these mutations change the structure of the spatacsin protein. The effect that the altered spatacsin protein has on the nervous system is not known. Researchers suggest that mutations in spatacsin may cause the signs and symptoms of spastic paraplegia type 11 by interfering with the protein's proposed role in the maintenance of axons. 
1298,SPINK5 ,"serine peptidase inhibitor, Kazal type 5","The SPINK5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called LEKT1. LEKT1 is a type of serine peptidase inhibitor. Serine peptidase inhibitors control the activity of enzymes called serine peptidases, which break down other proteins. LEKT1 is found in the skin and in the thymus, which is a gland located behind the breastbone that plays an important role in the immune system by producing white blood cells called lymphocytes. LEKT1 controls the activity of certain serine peptidases in the outer layer of skin (the epidermis), especially the tough outer surface known as the stratum corneum, which provides a sturdy barrier between the body and its environment. Serine peptidase enzymes are involved in normal skin shedding by helping to break the connections between cells of the stratum corneum. LEKT1 is also involved in normal hair growth, the development of lymphocytes in the thymus, and the control of peptidases that trigger immune system function.","Netherton syndrome At least 70 SPINK5 gene mutations have been identified in people with Netherton syndrome, a disorder involving skin and hair abnormalities and a high risk of allergies, asthma, and an inflammatory skin condition called eczema. Mutations in the SPINK5 gene result in a LEKT1 protein that is unable to control serine peptidase activity. The lack of LEKT1 function allows the serine peptidases to be abnormally active and break down too many proteins in the stratum corneum. As a result, excessive skin shedding takes place, and the stratum corneum is unusually thin and breaks down easily, resulting in the skin abnormalities that occur in Netherton syndrome. Loss of LEKT1 function also results in abnormal hair growth. The immune dysfunction that leads to allergies, asthma, and eczema in people with Netherton syndrome likely arises from a lack of LEKT1 control of peptidases involved in the triggering of immune system function. Excessive activation of the immune system caused by invasion of microbes in the abnormal skin is also thought to be involved. "
1299,SPR ,sepiapterin reductase,"The SPR gene provides instructions for making the sepiapterin reductase enzyme. This enzyme is involved in the last of three steps in the production of a molecule called tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Other enzymes help carry out the first and second steps in this process. The sepiapterin reductase enzyme converts a molecule called 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin to tetrahydrobiopterin. Tetrahydrobiopterin helps process several building blocks of proteins (amino acids), and is involved in the production of chemicals called neurotransmitters, which transmit signals between nerve cells in the brain. Specifically, tetrahydrobiopterin is involved in the production of two neurotransmitters called dopamine and serotonin. Among their many functions, dopamine transmits signals within the brain to produce smooth physical movements, and serotonin regulates mood, emotion, sleep, and appetite.","Dopa-responsive dystonia At least four mutations in the SPR gene have been found to cause dopa-responsive dystonia. This condition is characterized by a pattern of involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia), tremors, and other uncontrolled movements and usually responds to treatment with a medication called L-Dopa. Dopa-responsive dystonia can be caused by mutations in one copy or both copies of the SPR gene in each cell. These mutations lead to the production of a sepiapterin reductase enzyme with reduced or absent function. In most parts of the body, there are alternate pathways that do not use sepiapterin reductase for the production of tetrahydrobiopterin, but these processes do not occur in the brain. Therefore, people with sepiapterin reductase deficiency have a lack of tetrahydrobiopterin in the brain, which affects the production of dopamine and serotonin. The lack of these two neurotransmitters causes the movement problems and other characteristic features of dopa-responsive dystonia. "
1300,SPRED1 ,sprouty related EVH1 domain containing 1,"The SPRED1 gene provides instructions for making the Spred-1 protein, which helps control (regulate) the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. The Ras/MAPK pathway is involved in the growth and division of cells (proliferation), the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement, and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).The Spred-1 protein attaches (binds) to a protein called Raf, which is part of the Ras/MAPK pathway. The binding of the Spred-1 protein blocks the activation of Raf, stopping the signaling through the remainder of the Ras/MAPK pathway.","Legius syndrome Mutations in the SPRED1 gene cause Legius syndrome, a condition characterized by multiple café-au-lait spots, which are flat patches on the skin that are darker than the surrounding area.Several mutations have been identified throughout the SPRED1 gene. These mutations lead to a nonfunctional Spred-1 protein, usually because the mutated gene provides instructions for a shortened protein. The nonfunctional Spred-1 protein is unable to bind and block the activation of the Raf protein, which means the Ras/MAPK pathway is continuously active. It is unclear how mutations in the SPRED1 gene cause the signs and symptoms of Legius syndrome. "
1301,SPTLC1 ,serine palmitoyltransferase long chain base subunit 1,"The SPTLC1 gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of an enzyme called serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). The SPT enzyme is involved in making certain fats called sphingolipids. Sphingolipids are important components of cell membranes that play a role in many cell functions. The SPT enzyme initiates the first step of sphingolipid production, in which the molecules serine and palmitoyl CoA combine to form a molecule called ketodihydrosphingosine. Additional chemical reactions convert ketodihydrosphingosine into various types of sphingolipids. Within the cell, the SPT enzyme is mainly found on the endoplasmic reticulum, which is a structure involved in protein processing and transport.","Hereditary sensory neuropathy type IA At least nine mutations in the SPTLC1 gene have been found to cause hereditary sensory neuropathy type IA. This condition is characterized by nerve abnormalities in the legs and feet (peripheral neuropathy); a reduced ability to feel pain, which can lead to the development of open sores; and muscle weakness that can impair mobility. The SPTLC1 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SPTLC1 subunit. One mutation that has been found in multiple affected families worldwide replaces the amino acid cysteine with the amino acid tryptophan at position 133 in the SPTLC1 subunit (written as Cys133Trp or C133W).SPTLC1 gene mutations reduce the amount of functional SPTLC1 subunit that is produced, which results in an SPT enzyme with altered activity. This altered enzyme makes molecules called deoxysphingoid bases, which it does not normally produce. Because of this new function, the SPT enzyme's production of sphingolipid is reduced. Overall, there does not seem to be a decrease in sphingolipid production because the body is able to compensate for the SPT enzyme's reduced production. When accumulated, deoxysphingoid bases are toxic to neurons. The gradual destruction of nerve cells caused by the buildup of toxic molecules results in loss of sensation and muscle weakness in people with hereditary sensory neuropathy type IA. "
1302,SQSTM1 ,sequestosome 1,"The SQSTM1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called p62. This protein plays an important role in bone remodeling, a normal process in which old bone is broken down and new bone is created to replace it. The p62 protein helps regulate this process through its role in a chemical signaling pathway that promotes the formation of osteoclasts. Osteoclasts are specialized cells that break down bone tissue during bone remodeling.Studies suggest that p62 may have other functions in addition to its role in bone remodeling. It may be involved in recycling worn-out cell parts and unneeded proteins (autophagy), the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis), and the body's immune responses and inflammatory reactions.","Paget disease of bone More than 20 mutations in the SQSTM1 gene have been found to cause Paget disease of bone. Many SQSTM1 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the p62 protein. The most common mutation replaces the amino acid proline with the amino acid leucine at protein position 392 (written as Pro392Leu or P392L).Through a mechanism that is not well understood, SQSTM1 gene mutations appear to overactivate the chemical signaling pathway that promotes osteoclast formation. The increased signaling stimulates the production of too many osteoclasts and triggers these cells to break down bone abnormally. In people with Paget disease of bone, affected bone is broken down and replaced much faster than usual. When the new bone tissue grows, it is weaker and less organized than normal bone. These problems with bone remodeling cause certain bones to become unusually large, misshapen, and easily broken (fractured). It is unclear why the disease affects some bones but not others. "
1303,SRCAP ,Snf2 related CREBBP activator protein,"The SRCAP gene provides instructions for making a protein called Snf2-related CREBBP activator protein, or SRCAP. SRCAP is one of several proteins that help activate a gene called CREBBP. The protein produced from the CREBBP gene, called CREB binding protein, plays a key role in regulating cell growth and division and is important for normal development.","Floating-Harbor syndrome At least five SRCAP gene mutations have been identified in people with Floating-Harbor syndrome, a disorder involving short stature, slowing of the mineralization of the bones (delayed bone age), delayed speech development, and characteristic facial features. The SRCAP gene mutations that cause Floating-Harbor syndrome may result in an altered protein that interferes with normal activation of the CREBBP gene, resulting in problems in development. However, the relationship between SRCAP gene mutations and the specific signs and symptoms of Floating-Harbor syndrome is unknown. "
1304,SRD5A2 ,steroid 5 alpha-reductase 2,"The SRD5A2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called steroid 5-alpha reductase 2. This enzyme is involved in processing androgens, which are hormones that direct male sexual development. Specifically, the enzyme is responsible for a chemical reaction that converts the hormone testosterone to a more potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), in male reproductive tissues.Testosterone and DHT are essential for the normal development of male sex characteristics. Before birth, testosterone is responsible for the formation of internal male genitalia, including the tubes that collect sperm and carry it out of the testes (the epididymis and vas deferens) and glands that help produce semen (the seminal vesicles). DHT directs the development of the external genitalia, including the penis and scrotum, and the prostate gland. During puberty, these two hormones also play an important role in the development of male secondary sex characteristics such as the growth of facial and body hair, increased muscle mass, and deepening of the voice.","5-alpha reductase deficiency About 50 mutations in the SRD5A2 gene have been identified in people with 5-alpha reductase deficiency. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in steroid 5-alpha reductase 2. Some of these genetic changes render the enzyme completely inactive. Other mutations reduce but do not eliminate the enzyme's function.As a result of SRD5A2 mutations, the body cannot effectively convert testosterone to DHT in reproductive tissues. A shortage of DHT disrupts the formation of external genitalia before birth. People with 5-alpha reductase deficiency are genetically male, with one X and one Y chromosome in each cell, but they may be born with external genitalia that look predominantly female, or that are not clearly male or clearly female (sometimes called ambiguous genitalia). Other affected infants have external genitalia that appear predominantly male, but they often have an unusually small penis (micropenis) and the urethra opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias).During puberty, the testes produce more testosterone. Researchers believe that people with 5-alpha reductase deficiency develop secondary male sex characteristics in response to higher levels of this hormone. Some affected people also retain a small amount of 5-alpha reductase 2 activity, which may produce DHT and contribute to the development of secondary sex characteristics during puberty. "
1305,SRY ,sex determining region Y,"The SRY gene provides instructions for making a protein called the sex-determining region Y protein. This protein is involved in male sexual development, which is usually determined by the chromosomes an individual has. People usually have 46 chromosomes in each cell. Two of the 46 chromosomes, known as X and Y, are called sex chromosomes because they help determine whether a person will develop male or female sex characteristics. Girls and women typically have two X chromosomes (46,XX karyotype), while boys and men usually have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (46,XY karyotype).The SRY gene is found on the Y chromosome. The sex-determining region Y protein produced from this gene acts as a transcription factor, which means it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. This protein starts processes that cause a fetus to develop male gonads (testes) and prevent the development of female reproductive structures (uterus and fallopian tubes).","Swyer syndrome Mutations in the SRY gene have been identified in approximately 15 percent of individuals with Swyer syndrome, also known as 46,XY complete gonadal dysgenesis or 46,XY pure gonadal dysgenesis. SRY gene mutations that cause Swyer syndrome prevent production of the sex-determining region Y protein or result in the production of a nonfunctioning protein. A fetus whose cells do not produce functional sex-determining region Y protein will not develop testes but will develop a uterus and fallopian tubes, despite having a typically male karyotype. "
1306,ST3GAL5 ,"ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 5","The ST3GAL5 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called GM3 synthase. This enzyme carries out a chemical reaction that is the first step in the production of certain fatty molecules (lipids) called gangliosides. Specifically, GM3 synthase converts a molecule called lactosylceramide to a simple ganglioside called GM3. Further reactions use GM3 to create more complex gangliosides.Gangliosides are present on the surface of cells and tissues throughout the body, and they are particularly abundant in the nervous system. Although their exact functions are unclear, studies suggest that these molecules help regulate chemical signaling pathways that influence cell growth and division (proliferation), cell movement (motility), the attachment of cells to one another (adhesion), and cell survival. Gangliosides appear to be important for normal brain development and function.","GM3 synthase deficiency At least one mutation in the ST3GAL5 gene has been found to cause GM3 synthase deficiency, a condition characterized by recurrent seizures (epilepsy) and problems with brain development. The known mutation replaces a single protein building block (amino acid), arginine, with a signal to stop protein production prematurely. The mutation is written as Arg288Ter or R288X, although in older scientific articles it is sometimes written as Arg232Ter or R232X. The mutation prevents the production of any functional GM3 synthase. Without this enzyme, cells cannot produce GM3 or other gangliosides normally. It is unclear how a loss of this enzyme leads to the signs and symptoms of GM3 synthase deficiency. Researchers are working to determine whether it is the lack of gangliosides or a buildup of compounds used to make gangliosides, or both, that underlies the seizures and other problems with brain development that occur in this condition. "
1307,STAMBP ,STAM binding protein,"The STAMBP gene provides instructions for making a protein called STAM binding protein. Although its exact function is not well understood, within cells this protein interacts with large groups of interrelated proteins known as endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs). ESCRTs help transport proteins from the outer cell membrane to the interior of the cell, a process known as endocytosis. In particular, they are involved in the endocytosis of damaged or unneeded proteins that need to be broken down (degraded) or recycled by the cell. ESCRTs help sort these proteins into structures called multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which deliver them to lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments within cells that digest and recycle many different types of molecules.Through its association with ESCRTs, STAM binding protein helps to maintain the proper balance of protein production and breakdown (protein homeostasis) that cells need to function and survive. Studies suggest that the interaction of STAM binding protein with ESCRTs is also involved in multiple chemical signaling pathways within cells, including pathways needed for overall growth and the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis).","Microcephaly-capillary malformation syndrome At least 13 mutations in the STAMBP gene have been identified in people with microcephaly-capillary malformation syndrome, an inherited disorder characterized by an abnormally small head size (microcephaly), profound developmental delay and intellectual disability, recurrent seizures (epilepsy), and abnormalities of small blood vessels in the skin called capillaries (capillary malformations).The known STAMBP gene mutations reduce or eliminate the production of STAM binding protein. This shortage allows damaged or unneeded proteins to build up inside cells instead of being degraded or recycled, which may damage cells and cause them to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). Researchers suspect that abnormal apoptosis of brain cells starting before birth may cause microcephaly and the underlying brain abnormalities found in people with microcephaly-capillary malformation syndrome. A lack of STAM binding protein also alters multiple signaling pathways that are necessary for normal development, which may underlie the capillary malformations and other signs and symptoms of the condition. "
1308,STAT1 ,signal transducer and activator of transcription 1,"The STAT1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in multiple immune system functions, including the body's defense against a fungus called Candida. When the immune system recognizes Candida, it generates cells called Th17 cells. These cells produce signaling molecules (cytokines) called the interleukin-17 (IL-17) family as part of an immune process called the IL-17 pathway. The IL-17 pathway creates inflammation, sending other cytokines and white blood cells that fight foreign invaders and promote tissue repair. In addition, the IL-17 pathway promotes the production of certain antimicrobial protein segments (peptides) that control growth of Candida on the surface of mucous membranes.The STAT1 protein helps keep the immune system in balance by controlling the IL-17 pathway. When the STAT1 protein is turned on (activated), it blocks (inhibits) this pathway.In contrast to its inhibitory role in the IL-17 pathway, the STAT1 protein helps promote other immune processes called the interferon-alpha/beta (IFNA/B) and interferon-gamma (IFNG) signaling pathways. The IFNA/B pathway is important in defense against viruses, and the IFNG pathway helps fight a type of bacteria called mycobacteria, which includes the bacterium that causes tuberculosis.","Familial candidiasis At least 35 STAT1 gene mutations have been identified in people with familial candidiasis, an inherited tendency to develop infections caused by the Candida fungus (commonly called yeast infections). Most people with familial candidiasis have chronic infections of the skin, nails, and mucous membranes such as the lining of the mouth, collectively called chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, beginning in early childhood. Some people with STAT1 gene mutations have additional features such as increased susceptibility to other infections and an increased risk of autoimmune disorders, in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues or organs. This combination of signs and symptoms caused by STAT1 gene mutations is sometimes called immunodeficiency 31C.The STAT1 gene mutations that have been identified in people with familial candidiasis are described as ""gain of function"" because they increase the amount of activated STAT1 protein in cells. By increasing STAT1's inhibitory effect on the IL-17 pathway, the mutations impair the body's ability to fight Candida and result in the chronic infection that occurs in familial candidiasis. The effects of the increase in activated STAT1 protein on other signaling pathways are thought to underlie the variety of features that can occur in immunodeficiency 31C, but the specific mechanisms are not well understood. "
1309,STAT3 ,signal transducer and activator of transcription 3,"The STAT3 gene is part of a family known as the STAT genes. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are part of essential chemical signaling pathways within cells. When STAT proteins are turned on (activated) by certain chemical signals, they move into the cell's nucleus and attach (bind) to particular areas of DNA. The STAT proteins bind to regulatory regions near genes, which allows the proteins to control whether these genes are turned on or off. STAT proteins are called transcription factors on the basis of this action.Through its regulation of gene activity, the STAT3 protein is involved in many cellular functions. It helps control cell growth and division (proliferation), cell movement (migration), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). The STAT3 protein is active in tissues throughout the body. It plays an important role in the development and function of several body systems and is essential for life. In the immune system, the STAT3 protein transmits signals for the maturation of immune system cells, especially T cells and B cells. These cells help control the body's response to foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi. In addition, the protein is involved in the regulation of inflammation, which is one way the immune system responds to infection or injury, and it plays a role in cellular processes that promote allergic reactions. In the skeletal system, the STAT3 protein is involved in the formation of specialized cells that build and break down bone tissue. These cells are necessary for the normal development and maintenance of bones.","Autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome More than 100 germline mutations in the STAT3 gene have been identified in people with autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES), a disorder of the immune system that leads to recurrent skin and lung infections as well as abnormalities of the bones, teeth, and blood vessels. The condition is characterized by high levels of an immune system protein called immunoglobulin E (IgE), which is involved in allergic reactions. Most of the mutations involved in this condition change single amino acids in the STAT3 protein.Changes in the STAT3 gene that cause AD-HIES alter the structure and function of the STAT3 protein, impairing its ability to control the activity of other genes. Most of these mutations have a dominant-negative effect, which means that the altered protein produced from one copy of the STAT3 gene interferes with the function of the normal protein produced from the other copy of the gene. The lack of STAT3's signaling function disrupts the normal maturation of T cells (specifically a subset known as Th17 cells) and other immune system cells. The resulting immune system abnormalities make people with AD-HIES highly susceptible to infections, particularly bacterial and fungal infections affecting the lungs and skin. A shortage of functioning STAT3 protein prevents cells from reacting to signals that trigger allergic reactions, which explains why people with AD-HIES do not have an increased risk of allergies, despite having high levels of IgE. It is unclear why levels of this protein are elevated in affected individuals.The role of STAT3 protein in the formation and maintenance of bone tissue may help explain why STAT3 gene mutations lead to the skeletal and dental abnormalities characteristic of this condition, but it is unclear what causes blood vessel abnormalities in AD-HIES. "
1310,STAT4 ,signal transducer and activator of transcription 4,"The STAT4 gene provides instructions for a protein that acts as a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of certain genes. The STAT4 protein is turned on (activated) by immune system proteins called cytokines, which are part of the inflammatory response to fight infection. When activated, the STAT4 protein increases the activity of genes that help immune cells called T-cells mature into specialized T-cells. These specialized T-cells, called Th1 cells, produce specific cytokines and stimulate other immune cells to get rid of foreign invaders (pathogens) in the cell.","Systemic scleroderma A normal variation in the STAT4 gene has been associated with an increased risk of developing systemic scleroderma, which is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis) in the skin and internal organs. Although the STAT4 gene is known to stimulate the immune system in response to pathogens, it is unknown how the gene variation contributes to the increased risk of systemic scleroderma. Researchers believe that a combination of genetic and environmental factors may play a role in development of the condition. "
1311,STIM1 ,stromal interaction molecule 1,"The STIM1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1). The STIM1 protein is involved in controlling the entry of positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) into cells when levels of the ions are low, specifically through channels called calcium-release activated calcium (CRAC) channels. The flow of calcium ions through CRAC channels triggers signaling within cells that plays a role in many cellular functions including control of gene activity, cell growth and division, and immune function.STIM1 is found in the membrane of a cellular structure called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which, among other functions, stores calcium in cells. STIM1 recognizes when calcium levels in the ER are low and stimulates changes in the cell that allow STIM1 to attach (bind) to a protein called ORAI1 in the cell membrane. This protein, which is part of the CRAC channel, forms a hole (pore) in the cell membrane through which calcium ions can flow. STIM1 binding triggers the flow of calcium ions into the cell through the channel. STIM1 also likely plays a role in the process that stops the flow of calcium ions when enough calcium has entered.STIM1 is also found in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a structure similar to the ER that is found in muscle cells. This structure plays a major role in muscle contraction and relaxation by storing and releasing calcium ions. The STIM1 protein is thought to help replenish calcium stores in the sarcoplasmic reticulum through CRAC channels. It may also be involved in the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which stimulates muscle contraction.","Stormorken syndrome A mutation in the STIM1 gene causes Stormorken syndrome, a rare condition characterized by a low number of blood cells called platelets (thrombocytopenia) and consequent bleeding problems, a muscle disorder called tubular aggregate myopathy (described below), and other abnormalities. The mutation involved in this condition changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the STIM1 protein, replacing the amino acid arginine with the amino acid tryptophan at protein position 304 (written as Arg304Trp or R304W). This change occurs in a region of the protein that is thought to be involved in keeping it turned off when calcium ion levels are high. As a result of this change, the altered STIM1 protein is constantly turned on (constitutively active), continually stimulating calcium ion entry through CRAC channels regardless of ion levels in the ER. Because the genetic change enhances the activity of the protein, it is described as a ""gain-of-function"" mutation. Researchers suggest that the abnormal ion flow in platelets causes the cells to break down earlier than usual, leading to thrombocytopenia and bleeding problems in people with Stormorken syndrome. It is unknown how constitutively active STIM1 leads to the other features of the disorder. "
1312,STING1 ,stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1,"The STING1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in immune system function. STING helps produce beta-interferon, a member of a class of proteins called cytokines that promote inflammation. Inflammation normally occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and help with tissue repair.","STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy At least three STING1 gene mutations have been identified in individuals with STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI), a potentially life-threatening disorder that damages the skin, lungs, blood vessels, and other tissues. The mutations that cause SAVI are described as ""gain-of-function"" mutations because they enhance the activity of the STING protein, leading to overproduction of beta-interferon. Abnormally high beta-interferon levels cause excessive inflammation, resulting in damage to the body's own cells and tissues and leading to the signs and symptoms of SAVI. Disorders such as SAVI that result from abnormally increased inflammation are known as autoinflammatory diseases. "
1313,STK11 ,serine/threonine kinase 11,"The STK11 gene (also called LKB1) provides instructions for making an enzyme called serine/threonine kinase 11. This enzyme is a tumor suppressor, which means that it helps keep cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way. This enzyme helps certain types of cells correctly orient themselves within tissues (polarization) and assists in determining the amount of energy a cell uses. This kinase also promotes a type of programmed cell death known as apoptosis. In addition to its role as a tumor suppressor, serine/threonine kinase 11 function appears to be required for normal development before birth.","Peutz-Jeghers syndrome Inherited mutations in the STK11 gene cause Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, a condition characterized by the development of noncancerous growths called hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and a greatly increased risk of developing several types of cancer. More than 340 STK11 gene mutations have been identified in people with this condition. Many of these mutations result in the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the serine/threonine kinase 11 enzyme. Other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) used to build the enzyme. Mutations in the STK11 gene impair the enzyme's tumor suppressor function, allowing cells to grow and divide without control or order. This uncontrolled cell growth can lead to the formation of hamartomatous polyps and cancerous tumors. "
1314,STRC ,stereocilin,"The STRC gene provides instructions for making a protein called stereocilin. This protein is found in the inner ear and appears to be involved in hearing.Stereocilin is associated with hairlike structures called stereocilia, which project from specialized cells called hair cells in the inner ear. Specifically, stereocilin helps to maintain the structure of stereocilia by linking their tips to one another. Stereocilia bend in response to sound waves, triggering a series of reactions within hair cells that generate a nerve impulse. Such nerve impulses are transmitted via the auditory nerve to the brain, where they are interpreted as sound.","Nonsyndromic hearing loss Researchers have identified a few STRC gene mutations in individuals with nonsyndromic hearing loss, which is loss of hearing that is not associated with other signs and symptoms. Mutations in this gene cause a form of nonsyndromic hearing loss called DFNB16. This form of hearing loss can either be present before a child learns to speak (prelingual) or begin after a child learns to speak (postlingual). The hearing loss ranges from mild to profound and particularly affects the ability to hear high-frequency sounds.The STRC gene mutations that cause nonsyndromic hearing loss add a small amount of DNA to the STRC gene or delete DNA from the gene. In many cases, the mutation deletes a piece of chromosome 15 that includes the entire STRC gene. Mutations in this gene lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of stereocilin or prevent any of this protein from being produced. A loss of functional stereocilin likely alters the structure of stereocilia, preventing them from reacting normally to sound waves. As a result, hair cells cannot convert sound into electrical impulses, which leads to hearing loss in people with DFNB16. "
1315,STXBP1 ,syntaxin binding protein 1,"The STXBP1 gene provides instructions for making syntaxin-binding protein 1. In nerve cells (neurons), this protein helps regulate the release of chemical messengers called neurotransmitters from compartments known as synaptic vesicles. The release of neurotransmitters relays signals between neurons and is critical for normal brain function.To release its neurotransmitters, a synaptic vesicle must join (fuse) with the outer membrane of the neuron. The syntaxin-binding protein 1 regulates the formation of a group (complex) of proteins that allows vesicle fusion.","STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy At least 85 mutations in the STXBP1 gene have been found to cause STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy. This condition is characterized by recurrent seizures (epilepsy) that begin in infancy, abnormal brain function (encephalopathy), and intellectual disability. The mutations can alter the structure of the syntaxin-binding protein 1, result in an abnormally short protein, or add or delete small sections of the protein.The gene mutations that cause STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy reduce the amount of functional syntaxin-binding protein 1 produced from the gene. A shortage of this protein impairs the formation of the protein complex that allows vesicle fusion and the release of neurotransmitters from neurons. A change in neurotransmitter levels can lead to uncontrolled activation (excitation) of neurons, which causes seizures. This altered neuronal activity does not appear to impair the development or survival of neurons; the cause of the encephalopathy and other neurological problems in this condition is unclear. "
1316,SUCLA2 ,succinate-CoA ligase ADP-forming beta subunit,"The SUCLA2 gene provides instructions for making one part (a beta subunit) of an enzyme called succinate-CoA ligase. The body makes two slightly different versions of this enzyme: ADP-forming succinate-CoA ligase (A-SUCL) and GDP-forming succinate-CoA ligase (G-SUCL). Only A-SUCL contains the beta subunit produced from the SUCLA2 gene. This version of the enzyme is most active in tissues that require a large amount of energy, such as those of the brain and muscles.Succinate-CoA ligase plays a critical role in mitochondria, which are structures inside cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Within mitochondria, this enzyme is involved in a series of chemical reactions known as the citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle. These reactions allow cells to use oxygen and generate energy.Mitochondria each contain a small amount of DNA, known as mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA. Studies suggest that succinate-CoA ligase interacts with another enzyme, nucleoside diphosphate kinase, to produce and maintain the building blocks of mitochondrial DNA. Having an adequate amount of mitochondrial DNA is essential for normal energy production within cells.","Succinate-CoA ligase deficiency At least four mutations in the SUCLA2 gene have been identified in people with succinate-CoA ligase deficiency. Each of these mutations alters the structure of A-SUCL, reducing the enzyme's activity. However, SUCLA2 gene mutations do not affect the other version of succinate-CoA ligase, G-SUCL. Studies suggest that the activity of G-SUCL may be able to compensate for a loss of A-SUCL in some tissues.A shortage (deficiency) of A-SUCL leads to problems with the production and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA in the brain, muscles, and other tissues that require a large amount of energy. A reduction in the amount of mitochondrial DNA (known as mitochondrial DNA depletion) impairs mitochondrial function and the production of energy within cells. These problems lead to weak muscle tone (hypotonia), delayed development, and the other characteristic features of succinate-CoA ligase deficiency. "
1317,SUCLG1 ,succinate-CoA ligase alpha subunit,"The SUCLG1 gene provides instructions for making one part, the alpha subunit, of an enzyme called succinate-CoA ligase. Two slightly different versions of this enzyme are made with the alpha subunit: ADP-forming succinate-CoA ligase (A-SUCL) and GDP-forming succinate-CoA ligase (G-SUCL). A-SUCL is most active in tissues that require a large amount of energy, such as those of the brain and muscles. G-SUCL is most active in other tissues, particularly in the liver and kidneys.Both versions of succinate-CoA ligase play a critical role in mitochondria, which are structures inside cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Within mitochondria, these enzymes are likely involved in a series of chemical reactions known as the citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle. These reactions allow cells to use oxygen and generate energy.Mitochondria each contain a small amount of DNA, known as mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA. Studies suggest that succinate-CoA ligase interacts with another enzyme, nucleoside diphosphate kinase, to produce and maintain the building blocks of mitochondrial DNA. Having an adequate amount of mitochondrial DNA is essential for normal energy production within cells.","Succinate-CoA ligase deficiency At least two mutations in the SUCLG1 gene have been identified in people with succinate-CoA ligase deficiency. One mutation has been found to cause a very severe form of the condition known as fatal infantile lactic acidosis. Children with this condition usually live only a few days after birth. The mutation responsible for fatal infantile lactic acidosis deletes a small amount of genetic material from the SUCLG1 gene, which completely eliminates the activity of both versions of succinate-CoA ligase.At least one other SUCLG1 gene mutation results in a somewhat less severe form of succinate-CoA ligase deficiency that is characterized by very weak muscle tone (severe hypotonia), uncontrolled movements, hearing loss, and delayed development. This mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in succinate-CoA ligase, which reduces but does not eliminate the activity of both A-SUCL and G-SUCL.A shortage (deficiency) of succinate-CoA ligase leads to problems with the production and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA. A reduction in the amount of mitochondrial DNA (known as mitochondrial DNA depletion) impairs mitochondrial function in many of the body's cells and tissues. A total loss of succinate-CoA ligase activity appears to have more severe effects than a partial loss of enzyme activity. "
1318,SUMF1 ,sulfatase modifying factor 1,"The SUMF1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE). This enzyme is found in a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein processing and transport. The FGE enzyme modifies other enzymes called sulfatases, which aid in breaking down substances that contain chemical groups known as sulfates. These substances include a variety of sugars, fats, and hormones. Specifically, FGE converts a protein building block (amino acid) within sulfatases called cysteine into a molecule called C-alpha-formylglycine.","Multiple sulfatase deficiency At least 35 mutations in the SUMF1 gene have been found to cause multiple sulfatase deficiency. This condition is apparent at birth or early childhood and is characterized by neurological decline, scaly skin (ichthyosis), and skeletal abnormalities. Most SUMF1 gene mutations that cause multiple sulfatase deficiency change single amino acids in the FGE enzyme. These changes severely reduce enzyme function or produce an unstable enzyme that is quickly broken down. The activity of multiple sulfatases is impaired because the FGE enzyme modifies all known sulfatase enzymes. Sulfate-containing molecules that are not broken down build up in cells, often resulting in cell death. The death of cells in particular tissues, specifically the brain, skeleton, and skin, cause many of the signs and symptoms of multiple sulfatase deficiency. Research indicates that mutations that lead to reduced FGE enzyme function are associated with the less severe cases of the condition, whereas mutations that lead to the production an of unstable FGE enzyme tend to be associated with the more severe cases of multiple sulfatase deficiency. "
1319,SUOX ,sulfite oxidase,"The SUOX gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called sulfite oxidase, which helps break down protein building blocks (amino acids) that contain sulfur when they are no longer needed. Specifically, sulfite oxidase is involved in the final step of this process, in which sulfur-containing molecules called sulfites are converted to other molecules called sulfates by adding an oxygen atom (a process called oxidation).","Isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency At least 27 SUOX gene mutations have been identified in people with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency (ISOD), a severe disorder that causes brain damage and is generally fatal in the first months or years of life. The SUOX gene mutations that cause ISOD impair the function of sulfite oxidase, preventing complete breakdown of sulfur-containing amino acids. As a result, sulfites and other compounds left over from the partial breakdown process abnormally accumulate in the body. Researchers suggest that the nervous system is especially sensitive to this abnormal accumulation, and excessive levels of sulfite compounds that are toxic to the brain are thought to result in the brain damage that occurs in ISOD. "
1320,SURF1 ,"SURF1, cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor","The SURF1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is important in oxidative phosphorylation, the process by which the energy from food is converted into a form cells can use. Oxidative phosphorylation involves a series of reactions that take place through several different protein complexes. The SURF1 protein aids in the correct assembly of one of the protein complexes, or enzymes, involved in oxidative phosphorylation called complex IV.Complex IV, also known as cytochrome c oxidase or COX, accepts negatively charged particles (electrons) from earlier steps in oxidative phosphorylation. In addition, the enzyme accepts positively charged particles (protons) from inside the mitochondrion. Using the electrons and protons, the COX enzyme performs a chemical reaction that converts oxygen to water. The enzyme also transfers additional protons across the specialized membrane inside the mitochondrion. These processes create energy that is used to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source.",Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Genetics Home Reference provides information about Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. 
1321,SYNE1 ,spectrin repeat containing nuclear envelope protein 1,"The SYNE1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called Syne-1 that is found in many tissues, but it seems to be especially critical in the brain. The Syne-1 protein plays a role in the maintenance of the part of the brain that coordinates movement (the cerebellum). The Syne-1 protein is active (expressed) in Purkinje cells, which are located in the cerebellum and are involved in chemical signaling between nerve cells (neurons). The protein is thought to attach the membrane of Purkinje cells to the actin cytoskeleton, which is a network of fibers that make up the cell's structural framework. It is not clear what role this attachment plays in Purkinje cell function.","Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia type 1 At least seven mutations in the SYNE1 gene have been found to cause autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia type 1 (ARCA1). All the mutations that have been identified create a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the Syne-1 protein, resulting in an abnormally short protein with impaired function. A dysfunctional Syne-1 protein is thought to impair Purkinje cell function and disrupt signaling between neurons in the cerebellum. The loss of brain cells in the cerebellum causes the movement problems characteristic of ARCA1, but it is unclear how this cell loss is related to impaired Purkinje cell function. "
1322,SYNGAP1 ,synaptic Ras GTPase activating protein 1,"The SYNGAP1 gene provides instructions for making a protein, called SynGAP, that plays an important role in nerve cells in the brain. SynGAP is found at the junctions between nerve cells (synapses) where cell-to-cell communication takes place. Connected nerve cells act as the ""wiring"" in the circuitry of the brain. Synapses are able to change and adapt over time, rewiring brain circuits, which is critical for learning and memory. SynGAP helps regulate synapse adaptations and promotes proper brain wiring. The protein's function is particularly important during a critical period of early brain development that affects future cognitive ability.","SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability At least 40 mutations in the SYNGAP1 gene have been found to cause SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability. In addition to mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, this condition commonly features other neurological problems, including recurrent seizures (epilepsy) and autism spectrum disorder, which affects communication and social interaction. Gene mutations involved in SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability prevent the production of functional SynGAP protein from one copy of the gene, reducing the protein's activity in cells. Studies show that a reduction of SynGAP activity can have multiple effects in nerve cells, including pushing synapses to develop (mature) too early. The changes triggered by a reduction of SynGAP activity disrupt the synaptic adaptations in the brain that underlie learning and memory, leading to cognitive impairment and other neurological problems characteristic of SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability. "
1323,TAF1 ,TATA-box binding protein associated factor 1,"The TAF1 gene provides instructions for making part of a protein called transcription factor IID (TFIID). This protein is active in cells and tissues throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) to DNA. Transcription factor IID plays an essential role in regulating the activity of most genes.The TAF1 gene is part of a complex region of DNA known as the TAF1/DYT3 multiple transcript system. This region consists of short stretches of DNA from the TAF1 gene plus some extra segments of genetic material near the gene. These stretches of DNA can be combined in different ways to create various sets of instructions for making proteins. Researchers believe that some of these variations are critical for the normal function of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain.","X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism Several changes in the TAF1/DYT3 multiple transcript system have been identified in people with X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism. Some alter single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the gene; these changes are described as disease-specific single-nucleotide changes (DSCs). Another genetic change deletes a small number of nucleotides from the gene. Researchers are uncertain how these changes are related to the movement abnormalities characteristic of the disease.X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism may also be related to an extra segment of DNA in the TAF1/DYT3 multiple transcript system. The extra segment results from the insertion of a retrotransposon, which is a small piece of DNA that can move around to different positions in a cell's genetic material. When a retrotransposon inserts itself in or a near a gene, it can disrupt the gene's function. In this case, the retrotransposon insertion probably interferes with the normal function of the TAF1/DYT3 multiple transcript system.Researchers suspect that changes in the TAF1/DYT3 multiple transcript system disrupt the regulation of critical genes in neurons. This defect leads to the eventual death of these cells, particularly in areas of the brain called the caudate nucleus and putamen. These regions are critical for normal movement, learning, and memory. It is unclear why the effects of changes in the TAF1/DYT3 multiple transcript system appear to be limited to dystonia and parkinsonism. "
1324,TAP1 ,"transporter 1, ATP binding cassette subfamily B member","The TAP1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in the immune system. The TAP1 protein assembles with another protein called TAP2 (produced from the TAP2 gene) to form a protein complex called transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) complex. This complex, which is found in the membrane of a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, moves (transports) protein fragments (peptides) from foreign invaders into the endoplasmic reticulum. There, the peptides are attached to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins. The peptide-bound MHC class I proteins are then moved to the surface of the cell so that specialized immune system cells can interact with them. When these immune system cells recognize the peptides as harmful, they launch an immune response to get rid of the foreign invaders.","Bare lymphocyte syndrome type I At least six mutations in the TAP1 gene have been found to cause bare lymphocyte syndrome type I (BLS I). This immune system disorder often causes recurrent bacterial infections in the respiratory tract and open sores (ulcers) on the skin, although some people with BLS I have no symptoms of the condition. TAP1 gene mutations involved in BLS I prevent production of functional TAP1 protein. Absence of functional TAP1 impairs the formation of the TAP complex, without which peptides from foreign invaders cannot be transported into the endoplasmic reticulum and attached to MHC class I proteins. Consequently, MHC class I proteins are broken down, which results in a shortage of these proteins on the surface of cells. A lack of MHC class I proteins impairs the body's immune response to bacteria, leading to recurrent bacterial infections. Researchers are unsure why people with BLS I do not also get viral infections, but they suspect that other immune processes are able to recognize and fight viruses. It is also not clear how TAP1 gene mutations are involved in the development of skin ulcers. "
1325,TAP2 ,"transporter 2, ATP binding cassette subfamily B member","The TAP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in the immune system. The TAP2 protein assembles with another protein called TAP1 (produced from the TAP1 gene) to form a protein complex called the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) complex. This complex, which is found in the membrane of a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, moves (transports) protein fragments (peptides) from foreign invaders into the endoplasmic reticulum.

Researchers are unsure why people with BLS I do not also get viral infections, but they suspect that other immune processes are able to recognize and fight viruses. It is also not clear how TAP2 gene mutations are involved in the development of skin ulcers. "
1326,TARDBP ,TAR DNA binding protein,"The TARDBP gene provides instructions for making a protein called transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43). This protein is found within the cell nucleus in most tissues and is involved in many of the steps of protein production. The TDP-43 protein attaches (binds) to DNA and regulates an activity called transcription, which is the first step in the production of proteins from genes. This protein can also bind to RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA, to ensure the RNA's stability. The TDP-43 protein is involved in processing molecules called messenger RNA (mRNA), which serve as the genetic blueprints for making proteins. By cutting and rearranging mRNA molecules in different ways, the TDP-43 protein controls the production of different versions of certain proteins. This process is known as alternative splicing. The TDP-43 protein can influence various functions of a cell by regulating protein production.The TARDBP gene is particularly active (expressed) during early development before birth when new tissues are forming. Many of the proteins whose production is influenced by the TDP-43 protein are involved in nervous system and organ development.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis At least 60 mutations in the TARDBP gene have been found to cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a condition characterized by progressive muscle weakness, a loss of muscle mass, and an inability to control movement. Most mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the TDP-43 protein. The majority of these changes affect the region of the protein involved in mRNA processing, likely disrupting the production of other proteins. Changes to the TDP-43 protein cause the protein to misfold and form protein clumps (aggregates), which have been found in nerve cells that control muscle movement (motor neurons) in some people with ALS. It is unclear whether TDP-43 protein aggregates causes the nerve cell death that leads to ALS or if they are a byproduct of a dying cell.Some people with ALS caused by TARDBP gene mutations also develop a condition called frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which is a progressive brain disorder that affects personality, behavior, and language. It is unclear why some people with TARDBP gene mutations develop FTD and others do not. Individuals who develop both conditions are diagnosed as having ALS-FTD. "
1327,TAT ,tyrosine aminotransferase,"The TAT gene provides instructions for making a liver enzyme called tyrosine aminotransferase. This enzyme is the first in a series of five enzymes that work to break down the amino acid tyrosine, a protein building block found in many foods. Specifically, tyrosine aminotransferase converts tyrosine into a byproduct called 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. Continuing the process, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate is further broken down and ultimately smaller molecules are produced that are either excreted by the kidneys or used to produce energy or make other substances in the body.","Tyrosinemia At least 22 TAT gene mutations have been found to cause tyrosinemia type II. This condition often affects the eyes, skin, and mental development. Most of these mutations change single DNA building blocks (base pairs) within the TAT gene. Research suggests that the altered TAT gene produces a tyrosine aminotransferase enzyme with reduced activity. Other mutations delete all or part of the TAT gene, eliminating enzyme activity. As a result of these mutations, tyrosine is not properly broken down. Tyrosine levels are elevated and some tyrosine is converted into other molecules that may be toxic to cells. It is unclear how impaired break down of tyrosine leads to the skin, eye, and intellectual problems that characterize tyrosinemia type II. "
1328,TAZ ,tafazzin,"The TAZ gene provides instructions for producing a protein called tafazzin. Several different versions (isoforms) of the tafazzin protein are produced from the TAZ gene. Most isoforms are found in all tissues, but some are found only in certain types of cells. Tafazzin is located in structures called mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers of cells. Tafazzin is involved in altering a fat (lipid) called cardiolipin, which plays critical roles in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Tafazzin adds a fatty acid called linoleic acid to the cardiolipin molecule, which enables cardiolipin to perform its functions. Cardiolipin is necessary for maintaining mitochondrial shape, energy production, and protein transport within cells.","Barth syndrome More than 160 mutations in the TAZ gene have been found to cause Barth syndrome. This rare condition occurs almost exclusively in males and is characterized by an enlarged and weakened heart (dilated cardiomyopathy), muscle weakness, recurrent infections, and short stature. TAZ gene mutations that cause Barth syndrome result in the production of tafazzin proteins with little or no function. As a result, linoleic acid is not added to cardiolipin, which causes problems with normal mitochondrial shape and functions such as energy production and protein transport. Tissues with high energy demands, such as the heart and other muscles, are most susceptible to cell death due to reduced energy production in mitochondria. Additionally, affected white blood cells have abnormally shaped mitochondria, which could impair their ability to grow (proliferate) and mature (differentiate), leading to a weakened immune system and recurrent infections. Dysfunctional mitochondria likely lead to other signs and symptoms of Barth syndrome. "
1329,TBC1D20 ,TBC1 domain family member 20,"The TBC1D20 gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps regulate the activity of other proteins called GTPases, which control a variety of functions in cells. Often referred to as molecular switches, GTPases can be turned on and off. They are turned on (active) when they are attached (bound) to a molecule called GTP and are turned off (inactive) when they are bound to another molecule called GDP. The TBC1D20 protein turns off a GTPase known as RAB18 by stimulating a reaction that turns the attached GTP into GDP. When active, RAB18 is involved in a process called vesicle trafficking, which moves proteins and other molecules within cells in sac-like structures called vesicles. RAB18 regulates the movement of substances between compartments in cells and the storage and release of fats (lipids) by structures called lipid droplets. The protein also appears to play a role in a process called autophagy, which helps clear unneeded materials from cells. RAB18 is important for the organization of a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein processing and transport.The TBC1D20 protein is also thought to inactivate another GTPase called RAB1. RAB1 is important for maintaining the structure of a cell compartment called the Golgi apparatus, in which newly produced proteins are modified so they can carry out their functions. The TBC1D20 protein also appears to play a role in the copying (replication) of viruses in infected cells.","RAB18 deficiency At least five mutations in the TBC1D20 gene have been found to cause Warburg micro syndrome, which is the most severe of the disorders caused by RAB18 deficiency. Warburg micro syndrome is characterized by multiple eye abnormalities, vision impairment, severe intellectual disability, and a reduction of the hormones that direct sexual development (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism).The TBC1D20 gene mutations that cause Warburg micro syndrome eliminate the function of the TBC1D20 protein. Researchers suspect that loss of this protein's function disrupts the normal control of RAB18 activity. It is unclear, though, how the resulting changes in RAB18 activity might lead to eye problems, brain abnormalities, and other features of Warburg micro syndrome.Because Warburg micro syndrome can be caused by mutations in other genes that disrupt normal RAB18 activity, loss of control of this GTPase is thought to underlie the condition. It is unclear if impaired regulation of RAB1 activity contributes to the features of the condition. "
1330,TBC1D24 ,TBC1 domain family member 24,"The TBC1D24 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose specific function in the cell is unclear. Studies suggest the protein may have several roles in cells. The TBC1D24 protein belongs to a group of proteins that are involved in the movement (transport) of vesicles, which are small sac-like structures that transport proteins and other materials within cells. Research suggests that the TBC1D24 protein may also help cells respond to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress occurs when unstable molecules called free radicals accumulate to levels that can damage or kill cells. Studies indicate that the TBC1D24 protein is active in a variety of organs and tissues; it is particularly active in the brain and likely plays an important role in normal brain development. The TBC1D24 protein is also active in specialized structures called stereocilia. In the inner ear, stereocilia project from certain cells called hair cells. The stereocilia bend in response to sound waves, which is critical for converting sound waves to nerve impulses.","DOORS syndrome At least 10 mutations in the TBC1D24 gene have been identified in people with DOORS syndrome, a disorder involving multiple abnormalities that are present from birth (congenital). ""DOORS"" is an abbreviation for the major features of the disorder including deafness; short or absent nails (onychodystrophy); short fingers and toes (osteodystrophy); developmental delay and intellectual disability (previously called mental retardation); and seizures. Some people with DOORS syndrome do not have all of these features.Most of the TBC1D24 gene mutations that cause DOORS syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the TBC1D24 protein sequence. These mutations are thought to reduce or eliminate the function of the TBC1D24 protein, but the specific mechanism by which loss of TBC1D24 function leads to the signs and symptoms of DOORS syndrome is not well understood. "
1331,TBP ,TATA-box binding protein,"The TBP gene provides instructions for making a protein called the TATA box binding protein. This protein is active in cells and tissues throughout the body, where it plays an essential role in regulating the activity of most genes.The TATA box binding protein attaches (binds) to a particular sequence of DNA known as the TATA box. This sequence occurs in a regulatory region of DNA near the beginning of many genes. Once the protein is attached to the TATA box near a gene, it acts as a landmark to indicate where other enzymes should start reading the gene. The process of reading a gene's DNA and transferring the information to a similar molecule called mRNA is known as transcription.One region of the TBP gene contains a particular DNA segment known as a CAG/CAA trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (nucleotides) that appear multiple times in a row. Normally, the CAG/CAA segment is repeated 25 to 42 times within the gene.","Huntington disease-like syndrome A particular type of mutation in the TBP gene has been found to cause a progressive brain disorder known as Huntington disease-like 4 (HDL4) or spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17). The features of this disorder vary widely among affected individuals. The condition was first described as HDL4 in people whose signs and symptoms closely resembled those of Huntington disease, including uncontrolled movements, emotional problems, and loss of thinking ability. The disorder is now more commonly known as SCA17 because difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia) and other movement problems are the most frequent signs and symptoms. It is unknown why some people with TBP mutations have a disorder resembling Huntington disease, while others have more prominent ataxia.The mutation associated with HDL4/SCA17 increases the size of the CAG/CAA trinucleotide repeat in the TBP gene. People with this condition have 43 to 66 CAG/CAA repeats. People with 43 to 48 CAG/CAA repeats may or may not have signs and symptoms, while people with 49 or more repeats almost always develop the disorder.An increased number of CAG/CAA repeats in the TBP gene leads to the production of an abnormally long version of the TATA box binding protein. The abnormal protein builds up in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and disrupts the normal functions of these cells. The dysfunction and eventual death of neurons in certain areas of the brain underlie the signs and symptoms of HDL4/SCA17. Because the TBP gene is active throughout the body, it is unclear why the effects of a mutation in this gene are limited to the brain. "
1332,TBX1 ,T-box 1,"The TBX1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called T-box 1. Genes in the T-box family play important roles in the formation of tissues and organs during embryonic development. To carry out these roles, proteins produced from these genes bind to specific areas of DNA. The proteins attach to critical regions near genes and help control the activity of those genes. T-box proteins are called transcription factors on the basis of this action.The T-box 1 protein appears to be necessary for the normal development of muscles and bones of the face and neck, large arteries that carry blood out of the heart, structures in the ear, and glands such as the thymus and parathyroid. Although the T-box 1 protein acts as a transcription factor, researchers have not determined which genes are regulated by this protein.","22q11.2 deletion syndrome Most cases of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are caused by a deletion of a small piece of chromosome 22. This region of the chromosome contains 30 to 40 genes, including the TBX1 gene. In a small number of affected individuals without a chromosome 22 deletion, mutations in the TBX1 gene are thought to be responsible for the characteristic signs and symptoms of the syndrome. The identified mutations include changes in single DNA building blocks (base pairs) in the TBX1 gene and deletions of a small amount of genetic material from the gene. Some of these mutations reduce the amount of T-box 1 protein that is produced in cells, while other mutations alter the protein's function. These genetic changes likely affect the ability of the T-box 1 protein to bind to DNA and regulate the activity of other genes.Researchers believe that changes in the TBX1 gene, due to either a mutation in the gene or a deletion of part of chromosome 22, are responsible for many of the features of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Specifically, a reduction in the amount of T-box 1 or changes in the protein's normal function are associated with heart defects, an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), distinctive facial features, hearing loss, and low calcium levels. Some studies suggest that a loss of the TBX1 gene may also be associated with behavioral problems in affected individuals. "
1333,TBX5 ,T-box 5,"The TBX5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called T-box 5 that plays an important role in the formation of tissues and organs during embryonic development. This protein regulates the activity of other genes by attaching (binding) to specific regions of DNA. On the basis of this action, the T-box 5 protein is called a transcription factor.During embryonic development, the T-box 5 protein turns on (activates) genes involved in the normal development of the hands and arms (upper limbs). The T-box 5 protein also activates genes that play an important role in the growth and development of the heart. This protein appears to be particularly important for the formation of the wall (septum) that separates the right and left sides of the heart. The T-box 5 protein is also critical to the formation of the electrical system that coordinates contractions of the heart chambers.","Holt-Oram syndrome More than 70 mutations in the TBX5 gene have been found to cause Holt-Oram syndrome. Most of these mutations prevent the production of the T-box 5 protein. Other mutations change one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make the T-box 5 protein. Researchers believe that a change in amino acids impairs the protein's ability to bind to DNA. As a result of TBX5 mutations, genes that are important for development of the heart and upper limbs are probably not activated. Abnormal development of the heart and upper limbs is characteristic of Holt-Oram syndrome. "
1334,TBXAS1 ,thromboxane A synthase 1,"The TBXAS1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called thromboxane A synthase 1. This enzyme acts as part of a chemical pathway called the arachidonic acid cascade. Through this multistep pathway, a molecule called arachidonic acid is processed to produce several molecules with diverse functions in the body. As part of this pathway, thromboxane A synthase 1 converts a molecule called prostaglandin H2 into another molecule called thromboxane A2. Thromboxane A2 is involved in normal blood clotting (hemostasis), playing critical roles in the narrowing of blood vessels (vasoconstriction) to slow blood flow and the clumping (aggregation) of blood cells called platelets at the site of an injury.Studies suggest that the activity of thromboxane A synthase 1 may also be important for bone remodeling, which is a normal process in which old bone is removed and new bone is created to replace it, and for the production of red blood cells in bone marrow.","Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia At least four mutations in the TBXAS1 gene have been found to cause Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia. This condition is characterized by abnormally thick bones and a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) caused by scarring (fibrosis) of the bone marrow.Each of the known mutations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in thromboxane A synthase 1, which severely reduces the activity of the enzyme. A shortage of this enzyme's activity prevents the conversion of prostaglandin H2 to thromboxane A2. As a result, cells have more prostaglandin H2 than usual. Prostaglandin H2 is converted into several related molecules, including prostaglandin E2, which is thought to be involved in bone remodeling and in controlling the growth of immature red blood cells. Researchers speculate that an increase in prostaglandin E2 levels resulting from excess prostaglandin H2 contributes to the bone abnormalities and anemia that occur in people with Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia. However, the exact mechanism by which a lack of thromboxane A synthase 1 activity leads to the particular features of this condition is still unclear.A shortage of thromboxane A synthase 1 activity also reduces the level of thromboxane A2 in cells. Although this molecule plays a critical role in hemostasis, people with Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia do not appear to have problems with blood clotting. Researchers suspect that other molecules involved in vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation may be able to compensate for the lack of thromboxane A2 in these individuals. "
1335,TBXT ,T-box transcription factor T,"The TBXT gene provides instructions for making a protein called brachyury. Brachyury is a member of a protein family called T-box proteins, which play critical roles during embryonic development. T-box proteins regulate the activity of other genes by attaching (binding) to specific regions of DNA. On the basis of this action, T-box proteins are called transcription factors.The brachyury protein is important for the development of the notochord, which is the precursor of the spinal column in the embryo. The notochord disappears before birth, but in a small percentage of individuals, some of its cells remain in the base of the skull or in the spine. The notochord helps control the development of the neural tube, which is a layer of cells that ultimately develops into the brain and spinal cord.","Chordoma Changes in the TBXT gene have been associated with chordoma. A chordoma is a cancerous tumor that occurs along the spine or in the base of the skull, gradually extending further into the bone and into nearby soft tissue. The tumor develops from residual cells of the notochord that begin to grow and divide uncontrollably.An inherited duplication of the TBXT gene identified in a few families is associated with an increased risk of developing a chordoma. Duplications or increases in activity (expression) of the TBXT gene have also been identified in people with chordoma who have no history of the disorder in their family. In these individuals, the changes occur only in the tumor cells and are not inherited.Duplications and increases in expression of the TBXT gene both result in the production of excess brachyury protein. The specific mechanism by which excess brachyury protein contributes to the development of chordomas is unclear. "
1336,TCF4 ,transcription factor 4,"The TCF4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of many other genes. On the basis of this action, the TCF4 protein is known as a transcription factor. The TCF4 protein is part of a group of proteins known as E-proteins. E-proteins each bind with another identical or similar protein and then bind to a specific sequence of DNA known as an E-box. E-proteins are involved in many aspects of development.The TCF4 protein is found in the brain, muscles, lungs, and heart. This protein also appears to be active (expressed) in various tissues before birth. The TCF4 protein plays a role in the maturation of cells to carry out specific functions (cell differentiation) and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).","Pitt-Hopkins syndrome At least 50 mutations in the TCF4 gene have been found to cause Pitt-Hopkins syndrome, a condition characterized by severe intellectual disability and breathing problems. Some mutations delete a few building blocks of DNA (nucleotides) within the TCF4 gene, while other mutations delete the TCF4 gene as well as a number of genes that surround it. Still other TCF4 gene mutations replace single nucleotides. The type of the mutation does not appear to affect the severity of the condition.TCF4 gene mutations disrupt the protein's ability to bind to DNA and control the activity of certain genes. These gene mutations typically do not affect the TCF4 protein's ability to bind to other proteins. The TCF4 protein's inability to bind to DNA and control the activity of certain genes, particularly those genes involved in nervous system development and function, contributes to the signs and symptoms of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome. It is also likely that the loss of the normal proteins that are attached to the nonfunctional TCF4 proteins contribute to the features of this condition. "
1337,TCHH ,trichohyalin,"The TCHH gene provides instructions for making a protein called trichohyalin. This protein is primarily found in hair follicles, which are specialized structures in the skin where hair growth occurs. Trichohyalin can also be found in the hair strand (shaft). Once trichohyalin is produced, it is modified by other proteins so that it can attach (bind) to other trichohyalin proteins and to molecules called keratin intermediate filaments to create organized cross-links. These links form dense networks that give the hair shaft its cylindrical shape.","Uncombable hair syndrome At least one mutation in the TCHH gene has been found to cause uncombable hair syndrome. This condition is characterized by dry, frizzy, blond scalp hair that cannot be combed flat. This condition usually improves over time, and by adolescence individuals with uncombable hair syndrome have hair that lies flat and has normal or nearly normal texture.The TCHH gene mutation that has been identified leads to a premature stop signal in the instructions used to make trichohyalin, resulting in an abnormally short protein with severely reduced activity. A shortage (deficiency) of functional protein reduces the cross-links that are formed between trichohyalin proteins and keratin intermediate filaments. As a result, the cross-section of the hair shaft becomes triangular, heart-shaped, or flat. These angular hair shafts result in frizzy hair that will not lie flat, which is typical of uncombable hair syndrome. "
1338,TCIRG1 ,"T cell immune regulator 1, ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit a3","The TCIRG1 gene provides instructions for making one part, the a3 subunit, of a large protein complex known as a vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase). V-ATPases are a group of similar complexes that act as pumps to move positively charged hydrogen atoms (protons) across membranes. This movement of protons helps regulate the relative acidity (pH) of cells and their surrounding environment. Tight control of pH is necessary for most biological reactions to proceed properly.The V-ATPases containing the a3 subunit play an essential role in specialized cells called osteoclasts. These cells break down bone tissue as part of the normal process of bone remodeling, in which old bone is removed and new bone is created to replace it. Bones are constantly being remodeled, and the process is carefully controlled to ensure that bones stay strong and healthy.On the surface of osteoclasts, V-ATPases are embedded in a specialized, highly folded membrane called the ruffled border. The ruffled border faces the surface of bone, where it helps form a tightly sealed compartment between the osteoclast and the bone surface. V-ATPases pump protons into the compartment, making it very acidic. This acidic environment is necessary to break down bone.","Osteopetrosis More than 60 mutations in the TCIRG1 gene have been identified in people with osteopetrosis. These mutations cause the most severe form of the disorder, autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO).Many TCIRG1 gene mutations change how the gene's instructions are used to make the a3 subunit of V-ATPase. Other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the a3 subunit or lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the subunit. Studies suggest that most of the TCIRG1 gene mutations responsible for osteopetrosis eliminate the function of the a3 subunit.Without the a3 subunit, V-ATPases cannot pump protons out of osteoclasts. As a result, the compartment between the ruffled border and the bone surface is not acidified, and bone cannot be broken down. When old bone is not broken down as new bone is formed, bones throughout the skeleton become unusually dense. The bones are also structurally abnormal, making them prone to fracture. These problems with bone remodeling underlie the major features of autosomal recessive osteopetrosis. "
1339,TCN2 ,transcobalamin 2,"The TCN2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called transcobalamin (formerly known as transcobalamin II). This protein transports cobalamin (also known as vitamin B12) from the bloodstream to cells throughout the body. Cobalamin is obtained from the diet; this vitamin is found in animal products such as meat, eggs, and shellfish.During digestion, cobalamin is transported through intestinal cells into the bloodstream. Transcobalamin attaches (binds) to cobalamin when it is released into the bloodstream and transports the vitamin to cells. The transcobalamin-cobalamin complex binds to a receptor on the cell surface, which allows the complex to enter the cell. Transcobalamin releases cobalamin when the complex enters the cell and transcobalamin is broken down.Within cells, cobalamin helps certain enzymes carry out chemical reactions. Cobalamin plays a role in the processes that produce the building blocks of DNA (nucleotides) and break down various compounds such as fatty acids; these processes are needed for cell growth and division (proliferation) and cellular energy production. Cobalamin's role in these processes is particularly important in the formation of new blood cells and in the nervous system.","Transcobalamin deficiency More than 20 mutations in the TCN2 gene have been found to cause transcobalamin deficiency. This condition impairs the transport of cobalamin from the bloodstream to cells throughout the body. Affected individuals have difficulty gaining weight and growing at the expected rate (failure to thrive), vomiting, diarrhea, a shortage of all types of blood cells, and neurological problems. Many TCN2 gene mutations lead to a complete or near-complete lack (deficiency) of transcobalamin. Other TCN2 gene mutations result in a transcobalamin protein that cannot bind to cobalamin or a protein that cannot bind to the receptor at the surface of cells. The resulting lack of cobalamin within cells interferes with the functioning of certain enzymes, which impacts many cell activities. As a result, a wide range of signs and symptoms characteristic of transcobalamin deficiency can develop. "
1340,TCOF1 ,treacle ribosome biogenesis factor 1,"The TCOF1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called treacle. This protein is active during early embryonic development in structures that become bones and other tissues of the face, and it appears to play a critical role in the formation of these structures.Studies suggest that treacle is involved in the production of a molecule called ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a chemical cousin of DNA. Ribosomal RNA helps assemble protein building blocks (amino acids) into functioning proteins, which is essential for the normal functioning and survival of cells. Treacle is active in the nucleolus, which is a small region inside the nucleus where rRNA is produced.","Treacher Collins syndrome About 200 mutations in the TCOF1 gene have been identified in people with Treacher Collins syndrome, a condition that affects the development of bones and other tissues of the face. Most of these mutations insert or delete a small number of DNA building blocks (base pairs) in the TCOF1 gene, which leads to a reduction in the amount of functional treacle in cells. As a result, the production of rRNA is reduced, which likely triggers the self-destruction (apoptosis) of certain cells involved in the early development of facial bones and tissues. Researchers believe that this abnormal cell death may lead to the specific problems with facial development found in Treacher Collins syndrome. However, it is unclear why the effects of a reduction in rRNA are limited to facial development. "
1341,TECPR2 ,tectonin beta-propeller repeat containing 2,"The TECPR2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in a cellular process called autophagy. Cells use this process to recycle worn-out or unnecessary cell parts and break down certain proteins when they are no longer needed. During autophagy, materials that are no longer needed are isolated in compartments called autophagosomes. The autophagosomes are then transported to cell structures that break the materials down. The TECPR2 protein is thought to be important for the formation of autophagosomes.","Spastic paraplegia type 49 At least five mutations in the TECPR2 gene have been found to cause spastic paraplegia type 49. This condition is characterized by gradually worsening muscle stiffness (spasticity) and paralysis in the lower limbs (paraplegia), intellectual disability, and other neurological problems that lead to trouble regulating involuntary body processes, such as digestion and breathing. Many of the mutations that cause spastic paraplegia type 49 change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the TECPR2 protein. Others lead to production of an abnormally short protein that is likely broken down quickly. Alteration or loss of the TECPR2 protein is thought to impair autophagy, making cells less efficient at removing unneeded materials. Researchers suggest that nerve cells (neurons) may be particularly vulnerable to impaired autophagy because it is especially difficult to transport waste materials through their long extensions (axons and dendrites) for breakdown. The waste materials can build up in neurons and damage them. Damage to neurons results in the neurological problems that occur in spastic paraplegia type 49. "
1342,TECTA ,tectorin alpha,"The TECTA gene provides instructions for making a protein called alpha-tectorin. This protein is found in the tectorial membrane, which is part of a snail-shaped structure called the cochlea in the inner ear. The cochlea converts sound waves into nerve impulses, which are then transmitted to the brain. This process is critical for normal hearing.Alpha-tectorin is large protein with multiple regions (called domains) through which it interacts with other proteins. These interactions are critical for the normal formation of the tectorial membrane.","Nonsyndromic hearing loss Researchers have identified at least 40 TECTA gene mutations that can cause nonsyndromic hearing loss, which is loss of hearing that is not associated with other signs and symptoms. Mutations in this gene can cause two forms of nonsyndromic hearing loss: DFNA8/12 and DFNB21.DFNA8/12 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one mutated copy of the TECTA gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. This form of hearing loss can be present before a child learns to speak (prelingual) or begin after a child learns to speak (postlingual). In some cases the hearing loss is stable, while in others it becomes more severe over time.The TECTA gene mutations that cause DFNA8/12 change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in alpha-tectorin. The characteristics of the hearing loss depend on the domain in which the mutation occurs. Mutations in one domain tend to affect the ability to hear mid-frequency sounds, while mutations in another generally affect the ability to hear high-frequency sounds. All of these mutations alter the structure of the tectorial membrane and disrupt the conversion of sound to nerve impulses. However, it is unclear why changes in different areas of the alpha-tectorin protein lead to different hearing loss characteristics.DFNB21 is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the TECTA gene are mutated in each cell. This form of hearing loss is usually severe to profound and is prelingual.The TECTA gene mutations that cause DFNB21 mutations create a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the alpha-tectorin protein. These mutations lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of alpha-tectorin or prevent cells from making any of this protein. A total loss of alpha-tectorin function alters the structure of the tectorial membrane in such a way that sound cannot be converted to nerve impulses. "
1343,TEK ,TEK receptor tyrosine kinase,"The TEK gene (also called the TIE2 gene) provides instructions for making a protein called TEK receptor tyrosine kinase. The TEK receptor tyrosine kinase (or TEK receptor) is active (expressed) mainly in endothelial cells, which line the walls of blood vessels. When the TEK receptor is activated, it triggers a series of chemical signals that facilitates communication between endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. Layers of smooth muscle cells surround layers of endothelial cells lining the walls of blood vessels. Communication between these two cell types is necessary to direct blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) and ensure the structure and integrity of blood vessels.The TEK receptor is also found in bone marrow, where it is expressed in blood-forming cells called hematopoietic stem cells. The role of the TEK receptor in hematopoietic stem cells is unknown. Researchers speculate that the TEK receptor aids in hematopoietic stem cell growth and division (proliferation) or cell specialization (differentiation).","Multiple cutaneous and mucosal venous malformations At least eight mutations in the TEK gene have been found to cause multiple cutaneous and mucosal venous malformations (also known as VMCM). These mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the TEK receptor tyrosine kinase. The most common mutation replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid tryptophan at position 849 in the TEK receptor (written as Arg849Trp or R849W). The R849W mutation and most of the others that cause this condition result in a TEK receptor that is always turned on (overactive).An overactive TEK receptor is thought to disrupt the communication between endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. It is unclear how a lack of communication between these cells causes venous malformations. These abnormal blood vessels show a deficiency of smooth muscle cells while endothelial cells are maintained. Venous malformations cause lesions below the surface of the skin or mucous membranes, which are characteristic of VMCM. "
1344,TERC ,telomerase RNA component,"The TERC gene provides instructions for making one component of an enzyme called telomerase. Telomerase maintains structures called telomeres, which are composed of repeated segments of DNA found at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres protect chromosomes from abnormally sticking together or breaking down (degrading). In most cells, telomeres become progressively shorter as the cell divides. After a certain number of cell divisions, the telomeres become so short that they trigger the cell to stop dividing or to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). Telomerase counteracts the shortening of telomeres by adding small repeated segments of DNA to the ends of chromosomes each time the cell divides.In most types of cells, telomerase is either undetectable or active at very low levels. However, telomerase is highly active in cells that divide rapidly, such as cells that line the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, cells in bone marrow, and cells of the developing fetus. Telomerase allows these cells to divide many times without becoming damaged or undergoing apoptosis. Telomerase is also abnormally active in cancer cells, which grow and divide without control or order.The telomerase enzyme consists of two major components that work together. The component produced from the TERC gene is known as hTR. The hTR component is an RNA molecule, a chemical cousin of DNA. It provides a template for creating the repeated sequence of DNA that telomerase adds to the ends of chromosomes. The other major component of telomerase, which is produced from a gene called TERT, is known as hTERT. The function of hTERT is to add the new DNA segment to chromosome ends.","Dyskeratosis congenita At least 11 mutations in the TERC gene have been identified in people with dyskeratosis congenita. This disorder is characterized by changes in skin coloring (pigmentation), white patches inside the mouth (oral leukoplakia), and abnormally formed fingernails and toenails (nail dystrophy). People with dyskeratosis congenita have an increased risk of developing several life-threatening conditions, including cancer and a progressive lung disease called pulmonary fibrosis. Many affected individuals also develop a serious condition called aplastic anemia, also known as bone marrow failure, which occurs when the bone marrow does not produce enough new blood cells.Some of the TERC gene mutations that cause dyskeratosis congenita result in an absent or unstable hTR molecule; others change the way hTR interacts with hTERT or other components of the telomerase enzyme.TERC gene mutations lead to telomerase dysfunction, impaired maintenance of telomeres, and reduced telomere length. Cells that divide rapidly are especially vulnerable to the effects of shortened telomeres. As a result, people with dyskeratosis congenita may experience a variety of problems affecting quickly dividing cells in the body such as cells of the nail beds, hair follicles, skin, lining of the mouth (oral mucosa), and bone marrow.Breakage and instability of chromosomes resulting from inadequate telomere maintenance may lead to genetic changes that allow cells to divide in an uncontrolled way, resulting in the development of cancer in some people with dyskeratosis congenita. "
1345,TERT ,telomerase reverse transcriptase,"The TERT gene provides instructions for making one component of an enzyme called telomerase. Telomerase maintains structures called telomeres, which are composed of repeated segments of DNA found at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres protect chromosomes from abnormally sticking together or breaking down (degrading). In most cells, telomeres become progressively shorter as the cell divides. After a certain number of cell divisions, the telomeres become so short that they trigger the cell to stop dividing or to self-destruct (undergo apoptosis).

Telomerase is also abnormally active in most cancer cells, which grow and divide without control or order.The telomerase enzyme consists of two major components that work together. The component produced from the TERT gene is known as hTERT. The other component is produced from a gene called TERC and is known as hTR. The hTR component provides a template for creating the repeated sequence of DNA that telomerase adds to the ends of chromosomes. The hTERT component then adds the new DNA segment to chromosome ends.","Dyskeratosis congenita At least 18 mutations in the TERT gene have been identified in people with dyskeratosis congenita. This disorder is characterized by changes in skin coloring (pigmentation), white patches inside the mouth (oral leukoplakia), and abnormally formed fingernails and toenails (nail dystrophy). People with dyskeratosis congenita have an increased risk of developing several life-threatening conditions, including cancer and a progressive lung disease called pulmonary fibrosis. Many affected individuals also develop a serious condition called aplastic anemia, also known as bone marrow failure, which occurs when the bone marrow does not produce enough new blood cells.Most of the TERT gene mutations that cause dyskeratosis congenita change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the hTERT protein, causing it to be unstable or dysfunctional. The mutations interfere with telomerase function, leading to impaired maintenance of telomeres and reduced telomere length. Cells that divide rapidly are especially vulnerable to the effects of shortened telomeres. As a result, people with dyskeratosis congenita may experience a variety of problems affecting quickly dividing cells in the body such as cells of the nail beds, hair follicles, skin, lining of the mouth (oral mucosa), and bone marrow.Breakage and instability of chromosomes resulting from inadequate telomere maintenance may lead to genetic changes that allow cells to divide in an uncontrolled way, resulting in the development of cancer in some people with dyskeratosis congenita. "
1346,TET2 ,tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2,"The TET2 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. Based on the function of similar proteins, researchers believe the TET2 protein is involved in regulating the process of transcription, which is the first step in protein production. Although this protein is found throughout the body, it may play a particularly important role in the production of blood cells from hematopoietic stem cells. These stem cells are located within the bone marrow and have the potential to develop into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The TET2 protein appears to act as a tumor suppressor, which is a protein that prevents cells from growing and dividing in an uncontrolled way.","Essential thrombocythemia Some gene mutations are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in the TET2 gene have been identified in a small number of people with essential thrombocythemia, which is a condition characterized by high numbers of platelets in the blood. Platelets are the blood cells involved in blood clotting.TET2 gene mutations alter the TET2 protein in different ways; however, all of them appear to result in a nonfunctional protein. The role these mutations play in the development of essential thrombocythemia is unknown. "
1347,TFAP2A ,transcription factor AP-2 alpha,"The TFAP2A gene provides instructions for making a protein called transcription factor AP-2 alpha (AP-2α). As its name suggests, this protein is a transcription factor, which means it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. Transcription factor AP-2α is one of a group of related proteins called AP-2 transcription factors. These proteins regulate genes that help control cell division and the self-destruction (apoptosis) of cells that are no longer needed.Transcription factor AP-2α is involved in development before birth. In particular, this protein is active in the neural crest, which is a group of cells in the early embryo that give rise to many tissues and organs. Among the embryonic structures formed from neural crest cells are the branchial arches, which develop into the bones and other tissues of the head and neck. The TFAP2A gene appears to be especially important for the development of tissues derived from the first and second branchial arches.","Branchio-oculo-facial syndrome Mutations in the TFAP2A gene cause a condition called branchio-oculo-facial syndrome, which is characterized by skin anomalies on the neck, malformations of the eyes and ears, and distinctive facial features. Most TFAP2A gene mutations involved in this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the transcription factor AP-2α protein. These changes tend to occur in a region of the protein that enables it to bind to DNA. Although the effect of the amino acid changes on transcription factor AP-2α is unknown, the protein's DNA binding function is likely impaired. Without this function, the protein cannot control the activity of genes during development. TFAP2A gene mutations disrupt the development of structures derived from the branchial arches, which results in the characteristic features of branchio-oculo-facial syndrome. "
1348,TFAP2B ,transcription factor AP-2 beta,"The TFAP2B gene provides instructions for making a protein called transcription factor AP-2β. A transcription factor is a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. Transcription factor AP-2β is one of a group of related proteins called AP-2 transcription factors. These proteins regulate genes that help control cell division and the self-destruction of cells that are no longer needed (apoptosis).Transcription factor AP-2β is involved in development before birth. In particular, this protein is active in the neural crest, which is a group of cells in the early embryo that give rise to many tissues and organs. Neural crest cells migrate to form portions of the nervous system, glands that produce hormones (endocrine glands), pigment cells, smooth muscle and other tissues in the heart, and many tissues in the face and skull. Transcription factor AP-2β also appears to play an important role in the development of the limbs.","Char syndrome Fewer than 10 mutations in the TFAP2B gene have been identified in people with Char syndrome. These mutations alter the structure of transcription factor AP-2β. More than half of the known mutations alter a region of the protein that is critical for DNA binding. Other mutations occur in an area of the protein that is necessary for regulating gene activity. At least two changes in the TFAP2B gene prevent the production of any transcription factor AP-2β. A loss of this protein's function disrupts the normal development of structures derived from the neural crest, including the heart and facial features. Abnormal development of these tissues leads to the major features of Char syndrome. "
1349,TFR2 ,transferrin receptor 2,"The TFR2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called transferrin receptor 2. The main function of this protein is to help iron enter liver cells (hepatocytes). On the surface of hepatocytes, the receptor binds to a protein called transferrin, which transports iron through the blood to tissues throughout the body. When transferrin binds to transferrin receptor 2, iron is allowed to enter the cell.Additionally, transferrin receptor 2 can bind to other proteins to help regulate iron storage levels in the body by controlling the levels of another protein called hepcidin. Hepcidin is a protein that determines how much iron is absorbed from the diet and released from storage sites in the body in response to iron levels.","Hereditary hemochromatosis About 50 mutations in the TFR2 gene cause type 3 hemochromatosis, a form of hereditary hemochromatosis that begins in early adulthood, usually before age 30. Hereditary hemochromatosis is a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet. The excess iron accumulates in, and eventually damages, the body's tissues and organs.Some TFR2 gene mutations prevent the production of transferrin receptor 2. Other mutations result in proteins that have an incorrect sequence of protein building blocks (amino acids) or proteins that are too short to function normally. These mutations prevent the protein from binding to transferrin, blocking iron from entering hepatocytes.Mutations in the TFR2 gene are also thought to contribute to low levels of hepcidin in the body, which results in too much iron being absorbed from the diet. When this occurs, the excess iron is stored in the body's tissues, especially the liver. Iron overload leads to the organ damage and other signs and symptoms of type 3 hemochromatosis. "
1350,TG ,thyroglobulin,"The TG gene provides instructions for making a protein called thyroglobulin, one of the largest proteins in the body. This protein is found only in the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped tissue in the lower neck. Thyroglobulin combines with iodine and is modified and broken down to release small molecules known as thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones play an important role in regulating growth, brain development, and the rate of chemical reactions in the body (metabolism). Thyroglobulin also serves as a protein storehouse for iodine and inactive thyroid hormone until these substances are needed.","Congenital hypothyroidism Mutations in the TG gene can cause congenital hypothyroidism, a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of thyroid hormones starting from birth. The TG gene mutations involved in this condition either delete a small segment of the TG gene or change one of the DNA building blocks (base pairs). As a result, the 3-dimensional shape of thyroglobulin is altered, reducing the amount of properly structured protein that is available for thyroid hormone production. In most affected individuals, the thyroid gland is enlarged (goiter) in an attempt to compensate for reduced hormone production. Because cases caused by TG gene mutations are due to a disruption of thyroid hormone synthesis, they are classified as thyroid dyshormonogenesis. "
1351,TGFB1 ,transforming growth factor beta 1,"The TGFB1 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFβ-1). The TGFβ-1 protein triggers chemical signals that regulate various cell activities inside the cell, including the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the maturation of cells to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (motility), and controlled cell death (apoptosis).The TGFβ-1 protein is found throughout the body but is particularly abundant in tissues that make up the skeleton, where it helps regulate the formation and growth of bone and cartilage, a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. TGFβ-1 is also involved in the formation of blood vessels, development of muscle tissue and body fat, wound healing, inflammatory processes in the immune system, and prevention of tumor growth.","Camurati-Engelmann disease At least 12 mutations in the TGFB1 gene have been found to cause Camurati-Engelmann disease. This condition is characterized by abnormally thick bones (hyperostosis) in the arms, legs, and skull. Hyperostosis can cause bone pain, muscle weakness, and increased pressure on the brain that results in neurological problems, including headaches and hearing and vision problems.Most of the TGFB1 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the TGFβ-1 protein. Three mutations account for approximately 75 percent of cases of Camurati-Engelmann disease. Two of these mutations change the amino acid arginine at position 218 in the protein. One replaces arginine with the amino acid cysteine (written as Arg218Cys or R218C) and the other replaces arginine with the amino acid histidine (written as Arg218His R218H). The third mutation replaces the amino acid cysteine with the amino acid arginine at protein position 225 (written as Cys225Arg C225R).All TGFB1 gene mutations that cause Camurati-Engelmann disease result in the production of an overly active TGFβ-1 protein. This abnormal TGFβ-1 protein activity causes an increase in signal transduction, which leads to more bone formation. As a result, the bones in the arms, legs, and skull are thicker than normal, contributing to the movement and neurological problems often experienced by individuals with Camurati-Engelmann disease. "
1352,TGFB2 ,transforming growth factor beta 2,"The TGFB2 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called transforming growth factor beta-2 (TGFβ-2). This protein is found throughout the body and is required for development before birth and throughout life. To carry out its functions, TGFβ-2 attaches (binds) to receptor proteins on the surface of cells. This binding triggers the transmission of signals within cells, controlling various cellular activities. As part of a signaling pathway called the TGF-β pathway, the TGFβ-2 protein helps control the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (motility), and controlled cell death (apoptosis). Because the TGFβ-2 protein keeps cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way, it can suppress the formation of tumors.The TGFβ-2 protein plays a role in the formation of blood vessels, the regulation of muscle tissue and body fat development, wound healing, and immune system function. TGFβ-2 is especially abundant in tissues that make up the skeleton, where it helps regulate bone growth, and in the intricate lattice that forms in the spaces between cells (the extracellular matrix).","Loeys-Dietz syndrome At least 20 mutations in the TGFB2 gene have been found to cause Loeys-Dietz syndrome type IV. This disorder affects connective tissue, which gives structure and support to blood vessels, the skeleton, and many other parts of the body. Loeys-Dietz syndrome type IV is characterized by blood vessel abnormalities, heart defects, and skeletal deformities. The TGFB2 gene mutations that cause this condition lead to the production of a TGFβ-2 protein with little or no function. As a result, the protein cannot bind to its receptors. Although the TGFβ-2 protein and its receptors are not bound, TGF-β pathway signaling occurs at an even greater intensity than normal. Researchers speculate that the activity of other proteins in this signaling pathway is increased to compensate for the reduction in TGFβ-2 activity; however, the exact mechanism responsible for the increase in signaling is unclear. The overactive signaling pathway disrupts development of connective tissue and various body systems and leads to the signs and symptoms of Loeys-Dietz syndrome type IV.A few mutations have been found that delete the entire TGFB2 gene and some nearby genetic material. People with these deletions often have the features of Loeys-Dietz syndrome as well as features not usually associated with the condition, such as intellectual disability and movement problems. Researchers are working to determine which genes are missing as a result of these deletions and how their loss contributes to these additional signs and symptoms. "
1353,TGFB3 ,transforming growth factor beta 3,"The TGFB3 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called transforming growth factor beta-3 (TGFβ-3). This protein is found throughout the body and is required for development before birth and throughout life. To carry out its functions, TGFβ-3 attaches (binds) to receptor proteins on the surface of cells. This binding triggers the transmission of signals within the cell, controlling various cellular activities. As part of a signaling pathway, called the TGF-β pathway, the TGFβ-3 protein helps control the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (motility), and controlled cell death (apoptosis). Because the TGFβ-3 protein keeps cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way, it can suppress the formation of tumors.The TGFβ-3 protein is especially abundant in tissues that develop into the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles), and plays a key role in their development. The protein is also involved in the formation of blood vessels, regulation of bone growth, wound healing, and immune system function.","Loeys-Dietz syndrome At least 11 mutations in the TGFB3 gene have been found to cause Loeys-Dietz syndrome type V. This disorder affects connective tissue, which gives structure and support to blood vessels, the skeleton, and many other parts of the body. Loeys-Dietz syndrome type V is characterized by blood vessel abnormalities, heart defects, and skeletal deformities. The TGFB3 gene mutations that cause this condition lead to the production of a TGFβ-3 protein with little or no function. As a result, the protein cannot bind to its receptors. Although the TGFβ-3 protein and its receptors are not bound, TGF-β pathway signaling occurs at an even greater intensity than normal. Researchers speculate that the activity of other proteins in this signaling pathway is increased to compensate for the reduction in TGFβ-3 activity; however, the exact mechanism responsible for the increase in signaling is unclear. The overactive signaling pathway disrupts development of connective tissue and various body systems and leads to the signs and symptoms of Loeys-Dietz syndrome type V. "
1354,TGFBI ,transforming growth factor beta induced,"The TGFBI gene provides instructions for making a protein called transforming growth factor beta induced (TGFBI). This protein is released (secreted) from cells and becomes part of the extracellular matrix, which is an intricate network that forms in the spaces between cells and provides structural support to tissues. The TGFBI protein is thought to play a role in the attachment of cells to one another (cell adhesion) and cell movement (migration). This protein is found in many tissues in the body, including the the clear, outer covering of the eye (the cornea).","Lattice corneal dystrophy type I At least 26 mutations in the TGFBI gene can cause lattice corneal dystrophy type I. This inherited eye condition is characterized by a lattice-like accumulation of proteins (called amyloid deposits) that form in the cornea. These deposits cloud the cornea and lead to vision impairment in affected individuals. The cornea is made up of several layers of tissue. In lattice corneal dystrophy type I, the deposits occur in the stromal layer of the cornea and contain altered TGFBI proteins.The TGFBI gene mutations involved in lattice corneal dystrophy type I change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the TGFBI protein. The most common mutation replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid cysteine at position 124 (written as Arg124Cys or R124C). When the condition is caused by this mutation, it is often called classic lattice corneal dystrophy type I. Altered TGFBI proteins abnormally clump together and form amyloid deposits. However, it is unclear how the changes caused by the gene mutations induce the protein to form these deposits. "
1355,TGFBR1 ,transforming growth factor beta receptor 1,"The TGFBR1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) receptor type 1. This receptor transmits signals from the cell surface into the cell through a process called signal transduction. Through this type of signaling, the environment outside the cell affects activities inside the cell such as stimulation of cell growth and division.To carry out its signaling function, TGF-β receptor type 1 spans the cell membrane, so that one end of the protein projects from the outer surface of the cell (the extracellular domain) and the other end remains inside the cell (the intracellular domain). A protein called TGF-β attaches (binds) to the extracellular domain of TGF-β receptor type 1, which turns on (activates) the receptor and allows it to bind to another receptor on the cell surface. These three proteins form a complex, which triggers signal transduction by activating other proteins in a signaling pathway called the TGF-β pathway.Signals transmitted by the TGF-β receptor complex trigger various responses by the cell, including the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the maturation of cells to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (motility), and controlled cell death (apoptosis). Because TGF-β receptor type 1 helps prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way, it can suppress the formation of tumors.","Loeys-Dietz syndrome More than 35 mutations in the TGFBR1 gene have been found to cause Loeys-Dietz syndrome type I. Loeys-Dietz syndrome affects connective tissue, which gives structure and support to blood vessels, the skeleton, and other parts of the body. This type of Loeys-Dietz syndrome is characterized by blood vessel abnormalities and skeletal deformities. The TGFBR1 gene mutations that cause Loeys-Dietz syndrome are present in one copy of the gene in each cell. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in TGF-β receptor type 1, resulting in a receptor with little or no function. Although the receptor has severely reduced function, TGF-β pathway signaling occurs at an even greater intensity than normal. Researchers speculate that the activity of other proteins in this signaling pathway is increased to compensate for the reduction in TGF-β receptor type 1 activity; however, the exact mechanism responsible for the increase in signaling is unclear. The overactive signaling pathway disrupts development of connective tissue and various body systems and leads to the varied signs and symptoms of Loeys-Dietz syndrome type I. "
1356,TGFBR2 ,transforming growth factor beta receptor 2,"The TGFBR2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) receptor type 2. This receptor transmits signals from the cell surface into the cell through a process called signal transduction. Through this type of signaling, the environment outside the cell affects activities inside the cell such as stimulation of cell growth and division.To carry out its signaling function, the TGF-β receptor type 2 spans the cell membrane, so that one end of the protein projects from the outer surface of the cell (the extracellular domain) and the other end remains inside the cell (the intracellular domain). A protein called TGF-β attaches (binds) to the extracellular domain of the TGF-β receptor type 2, which turns on (activates) the receptor and allows it to bind to another receptor on the cell surface. These three proteins form a complex, which triggers signal transduction by activating other proteins in a signaling pathway called the TGF-β pathway.Signals transmitted by the TGF-β receptor complex trigger various responses by the cell, including the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the maturation of cells to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (motility), and controlled cell death (apoptosis). Because TGF-β receptor type 2 helps prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way, it can suppress the formation of tumors.","Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection At least nine TGFBR2 gene mutations have been identified in people with familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (familial TAAD). This disorder involves problems with the aorta, which is the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body. The aorta can weaken and stretch, causing a bulge in the blood vessel wall (an aneurysm). Stretching of the aorta may also lead to a sudden tearing of the layers in the aorta wall (aortic dissection). Aortic aneurysm and dissection can cause life-threatening internal bleeding.The TGFBR2 gene mutations that cause familial TAAD disturb signal transduction. The disturbed signaling can impair cell growth and development. It is not known how these changes result in the specific aortic abnormalities associated with familial TAAD. "
1357,TGIF1 ,TGFB induced factor homeobox 1,"The TGIF1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called TG-interacting factor. This protein is important for normal development of the front part of the brain (forebrain). TG-interacting factor is a transcription factor, which means that it regulates the activity of certain genes. This protein turns off genes by attaching (binding) to specific regions of DNA or by interacting with other DNA-binding proteins.TG-interacting factor regulates signaling pathways that are important for embryonic development. This protein blocks the signals of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) pathway. This signaling pathway transmits chemical signals from the cell surface to the nucleus, which allows the environment outside the cell to affect how the cell produces other proteins. TG-interacting factor also blocks a molecule called retinoic acid from regulating gene activity. Retinoic acid, a form of vitamin A, binds to a group of transcription factors that regulate a number of genes important for early development. By blocking these signaling pathways, TG-interacting factor ensures that certain genes are turned off at the proper time.","Nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly At least 13 mutations in the TGIF1 gene have been found to cause nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly. This condition occurs when the brain fails to divide into two halves (hemispheres) during early development. TGIF1 gene mutations are the fourth most common cause of nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly. These mutations disrupt the protein's ability to bind with DNA or interact with other proteins. As a result, TG-interacting factor cannot block the signals of the TGF-β pathway and retinoic acid. If the signals involved in forebrain development are not properly regulated, the brain does not separate into two hemispheres. The signs and symptoms of nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly are caused by abnormal development of the brain and face. "
1358,TGM1 ,transglutaminase 1,"The TGM1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called transglutaminase 1. This enzyme is found in cells that make up the outermost layer of the skin (the epidermis). Transglutaminase 1 is involved in the formation of the cornified cell envelope, which is a structure that surrounds skin cells and helps form a protective barrier between the body and its environment. Specifically, transglutaminase 1 forms strong bonds, called cross-links, between the structural proteins that make up the cornified cell envelope. This cross-linking provides strength and stability to the epidermis.","Lamellar ichthyosis Many mutations in the TGM1 gene have been found to cause lamellar ichthyosis, which is a condition that causes scaly skin that covers much of the body, and other skin abnormalities. Some TGM1 gene mutations that cause this condition change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the transglutaminase 1 enzyme. The most frequently occurring mutation (written as 877-2A>G) affects the way the gene's instructions are pieced together to form the enzyme and results in an abnormally shortened, nonfunctional enzyme. Other TGM1 gene mutations result in a transglutaminase 1 enzyme that cannot function normally, is abnormally short, or is not produced. A lack of functional transglutaminase 1 prevents the formation of the cornified cell envelope, causing the skin abnormalities of lamellar ichthyosis. "
1359,TGM3 ,transglutaminase 3,"The TGM3 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called transglutaminase 3. This enzyme is found in certain skin cells called keratinocytes and corneocytes, as well as in various structures that make up scalp hair, including the root and strand (shaft).Transglutaminase 3 helps proteins attach (bind) to each other at specific protein building blocks (amino acids). Specifically, transglutaminase 3 helps bind proteins together at their glutamine and lysine amino acids. This binding forms stabilizing cross-links between proteins. These protein cross-links provide strength and structure to cells, particularly skin and hair cells.","Uncombable hair syndrome At least one mutation in the TGM3 gene has been found to cause uncombable hair syndrome. This condition is characterized by dry, frizzy, blond scalp hair that cannot be combed flat. This condition usually improves over time, and by adolescence individuals with uncombable hair syndrome have hair that lies flat and has normal or nearly normal texture.The TGM3 gene mutation that has been identified leads to a premature stop signal in the instructions used to make transglutaminase 3, resulting in an abnormally short enzyme with severely reduced activity. A shortage (deficiency) of functional enzyme impairs cross-linking between certain proteins. Particularly, the hair shaft protein trichohyalin cannot bind to other trichohyalin proteins or to molecules called keratin intermediate filaments. These proteins and molecules need to bind to each other to form the cross-links that give the hair shaft its cylindrical shape. Because transglutaminase 3 cannot facilitate these cross-links, the cross-section of the hair shaft becomes triangular, heart-shaped, or flat. These angular hair shafts result in frizzy hair that will not lie flat, which is typical of uncombable hair syndrome. "
1360,TGM5 ,transglutaminase 5,"The TGM5 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called transglutaminase 5. This enzyme is found in many of the body's tissues, although it seems to play a particularly important role in the outer layer of skin (the epidermis). In the epidermis, transglutaminase 5 is involved in the formation of the cornified cell envelope, which is a structure that surrounds cells and helps the skin form a protective barrier between the body and its environment. Specifically, transglutaminase 5 forms strong bonds, called cross-links, between the structural proteins that make up the cornified cell envelope. This cross-linking provides strength and stability to the epidermis.","Acral peeling skin syndrome At least 22 mutations in the TGM5 gene have been found to cause acral peeling skin syndrome. This condition is characterized by painless peeling of the top layer of skin that is most apparent on the hands and feet but can also affect the arms and legs. Most of the mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in transglutaminase 5, including the most common mutation in people of European ancestry, which replaces the amino acid glycine with the amino acid cysteine at position 113 (written as Gly113Cys or G113C). TGM5 gene mutations reduce the amount of transglutaminase 5 that is produced or prevent cells from making any of this enzyme. A shortage of transglutaminase 5 impairs protein cross-linking, which weakens the cornified cell envelope and allows the outermost cells of the epidermis to separate easily from the underlying skin and peel off. This peeling is most noticeable on the hands and feet probably because those areas tend to be heavily exposed to moisture and friction. "
1361,TH ,tyrosine hydroxylase,"The TH gene provides instructions for making the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, which is important for normal functioning of the nervous system. Tyrosine hydroxylase takes part in the first step of the pathway that produces a group of hormones called catecholamines. This enzyme helps convert the protein building block (amino acid) tyrosine to a catecholamine called dopamine. Dopamine is also known as a neurotransmitter because it transmits signals between nerve cells in the brain to help control physical movement and emotional behavior. Other catecholamines called norepinephrine and epinephrine are produced from dopamine. Norepinephrine and epinephrine are involved in the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary body processes such as the regulation of blood pressure and body temperature.","Dopa-responsive dystonia More than two dozen mutations in the TH gene have been found to cause dopa-responsive dystonia. This condition is characterized by a pattern of involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia), tremors, and other uncontrolled movements and usually responds to treatment with a medication called L-Dopa. Most TH gene mutations that cause this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme, resulting in a decrease in functional enzyme. A reduction in normal tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme leads to a decrease in the production of dopamine, which causes the movement problems characteristic of dopa-responsive dystonia. The amount of functional enzyme that is produced is associated with the severity of the signs and symptoms. Less functional enzyme leads to more severe symptoms. "
1362,THAP1 ,THAP domain containing 1,"The THAP1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and regulates the activity of other genes. Through this function, it is thought to help control several processes in the body, including the growth and division (proliferation) of endothelial cells, which line the inside surface of blood vessels and other circulatory system structures called lymphatic vessels. The THAP1 protein also plays a role in the self-destruction of cells that are no longer needed (apoptosis).","Dystonia 6 More than 70 THAP1 gene mutations have been identified in people with dystonia 6. Dystonia 6 is one of many forms of dystonia, which is a group of conditions characterized by involuntary movements, twisting (torsion) and tensing of various muscles, and unusual positioning of affected body parts.Most of the THAP1 gene mutations that cause dystonia 6 change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the THAP1 protein or result in a premature stop signal that leads to an abnormally short protein. Studies indicate that many of the mutations affect the stability of the THAP1 protein, reducing the amount of functional THAP1 protein available for DNA binding. Others may impair the protein's ability to bind with the correct regions of DNA. Problems with DNA binding likely disrupt the proper regulation of gene activity, leading to the signs and symptoms of dystonia 6.A particular THAP1 gene mutation is specific to a Mennonite population in the Midwestern United States in which dystonia 6 was first described. This mutation changes the DNA sequence in a region of the gene known as exon 2. Some researchers use the term DYT6 dystonia to refer to dystonia caused by this particular mutation, and the broader term THAP1 dystonia to refer to dystonia caused by any THAP1 gene mutation. In general, mutations affecting the region of the THAP1 protein that binds to DNA, including the mutation found in the Mennonite population, tend to result in more severe signs and symptoms than mutations affecting other regions of the protein. "
1363,THPO ,thrombopoietin,"The THPO gene provides instructions for making a protein called thrombopoietin that promotes the growth and division (proliferation) of cells. This protein attaches to (binds) and turns on (activates) the thrombopoietin receptor, which stimulates several signaling pathways that transmit chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. These pathways are important for controlling the production of blood cells.Thrombopoietin is especially important for the proliferation of certain blood cells called megakaryocytes, which produce platelets, the cells involved in blood clotting. Research suggests that thrombopoietin signaling may also play a role in the renewal of hematopoietic stem cells, which are stem cells located within the bone marrow that have the potential to develop into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.","Essential thrombocythemia Several mutations in the THPO gene have been found in people with essential thrombocythemia, a condition characterized by an increased number of platelets in the blood. Because platelets are the blood cells involved in blood clotting, abnormal clotting (thrombosis) is common in people with essential thrombocythemia.THPO gene mutations are found in families with an inherited form of the condition called familial essential thrombocythemia. These mutations affect a region of the gene that usually blocks (inhibits) the production of the thrombopoietin protein (a process called translation). THPO gene mutations lead to increased translation of the protein. The excess protein can abnormally activate the thrombopoietin receptor and the signaling pathways, leading to overproduction of megakaryocytes and increased numbers of platelets. Excess platelets can cause thrombosis, which leads to many signs and symptoms of essential thrombocythemia. "
1364,TIMM8A ,translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 8A,"The TIMM8A gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found inside mitochondria, which are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Mitochondria have two membranes, an outer membrane and an inner membrane, which are separated by a fluid-filled area called the intermembrane space. The TIMM8A protein is found in the intermembrane space, where it forms a complex (a group of proteins that work together) with a very similar protein called TIMM13. This complex transports other proteins across the intermembrane space to the mitochondrial inner membrane.","Deafness-dystonia-optic neuronopathy syndrome At least 20 mutations in the TIMM8A gene have been found to cause deafness-dystonia-optic neuronopathy (DDON) syndrome. Most of these mutations result in the absence of functional TIMM8A protein inside the mitochondria, which prevents the formation of the TIMM8A/TIMM13 complex. Researchers believe that the lack of this complex leads to abnormal transport of proteins across the intermembrane space, although it is unclear how abnormal protein transport affects the function of the mitochondria and causes the signs and symptoms of DDON syndrome.Some people with DDON syndrome have large DNA deletions that remove the entire TIMM8A gene and one end of a neighboring gene known as BTK. Mutations in the BTK gene cause X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), which is characterized by an increased susceptibility to infections. Individuals with large DNA deletions that include the TIMM8A gene and the BTK gene have the signs and symptoms of both DDON syndrome and XLA. "
1365,TINF2 ,TERF1 interacting nuclear factor 2,"The TINF2 gene provides instructions for making part of the shelterin protein complex. This complex consists of a group of proteins that work together to help maintain structures known as telomeres, which are found at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres help protect chromosomes from abnormally sticking together or breaking down (degrading).The shelterin complex helps protect telomeres from the cell's DNA repair process. Without the protection of shelterin, the repair mechanism would sense the chromosome ends as abnormal breaks in the DNA sequence and either attempt to join the ends together or initiate cellular self-destruction (apoptosis).","Dyskeratosis congenita At least 15 mutations in the TINF2 gene have been identified in people with dyskeratosis congenita, including a severe form of this disorder called Revesz syndrome. Dyskeratosis congenita is characterized by changes in skin coloring (pigmentation), white patches inside the mouth (oral leukoplakia), and abnormally formed fingernails and toenails (nail dystrophy). People with dyskeratosis congenita have an increased risk of developing several life-threatening conditions, including cancer and a progressive lung disease called pulmonary fibrosis. Many affected individuals also develop a serious condition called aplastic anemia, also known as bone marrow failure, which occurs when the bone marrow does not produce enough new blood cells.Most of the TINF2 gene mutations that cause dyskeratosis congenita change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the TINF2 protein, likely disrupting the function of the protein. The mutations result in dysfunction of the shelterin complex, interfering with its protection of telomeres and leading to reduced telomere length. Shortened telomeres can result in damage to genetic material, causing the cell to stop dividing or to undergo apoptosis.Cells that divide rapidly are especially vulnerable to the effects of shortened telomeres. As a result, people with dyskeratosis congenita may experience a variety of problems affecting quickly dividing cells in the body such as cells of the nail beds, hair follicles, skin, lining of the mouth (oral mucosa), and bone marrow.Breakage and instability of chromosomes resulting from inadequate telomere maintenance may lead to genetic changes that allow cells to divide in an uncontrolled way, resulting in the development of cancer in some people with dyskeratosis congenita. "
1366,TK2 ,"thymidine kinase 2, mitochondrial","The TK2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called thymidine kinase 2 that functions within cell structures called mitochondria, which are found in all tissues. Mitochondria are involved in a wide variety of cellular activities, including energy production; chemical signaling; and regulation of cell growth, cell division, and cell death. Mitochondria contain their own genetic material, known as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is essential for the normal function of these structures. Thymidine kinase 2 is involved in the production and maintenance of mtDNA. Specifically, this enzyme plays a role in recycling mtDNA building blocks (nucleotides) so that errors in mtDNA sequencing can be repaired and new mtDNA molecules can be produced.","TK2-related mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, myopathic form More than 30 mutations in the TK2 gene have been found to cause TK2-related mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, myopathic form (TK2-MDS). TK2-MDS is an inherited condition that causes progressive muscle weakness (myopathy), typically beginning in early childhood. About two-thirds of the mutations that cause this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in thymidine kinase 2. All TK2 gene mutations result in a decrease of enzyme activity, which impairs recycling of mtDNA nucleotides. A shortage of nucleotides available for the repair and production of mtDNA molecules leads to a reduction in the amount of mtDNA (known as mtDNA depletion) and impairs mitochondrial function. Greater mtDNA depletion tends to cause more severe signs and symptoms. The muscle cells of people with TK2-MDS have very low amounts of mtDNA, ranging from 5 to 30 percent of normal. Other tissues can have 60 percent of normal to normal amounts of mtDNA. The cause for the variability in the amount of mtDNA lost among affected individuals, even those with the same mutations, is unknown.It is unclear why TK2 gene mutations typically affect only muscle tissue, but the high energy demands of muscle cells may make them the most susceptible to cell death when mtDNA is lost and less energy is produced in cells. "
1367,TMCO1 ,transmembrane and coiled-coil domains 1,"The TMCO1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms specialized structures called channels through which positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) flow. The protein is found in the membrane of a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which acts as a storage center for calcium ions. When there is too much calcium in the endoplasmic reticulum, four TMCO1 proteins come together to form a channel that releases the excess calcium into the surrounding fluid inside the cell (cytoplasm).The TMCO1 protein helps regulate the balance of calcium ions inside the endoplasmic reticulum. Calcium acts as a signal for many cellular functions including cell growth and division and gene activity. The proper balance of these ions in cells and in cell compartments is important for the development and function of various tissues and organs.","Cerebro-facio-thoracic dysplasia At least four TMCO1 gene mutations have been found to cause cerebro-facio-thoracic dysplasia, which is characterized by severe intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and bone abnormalities that primarily involve the ribs and spinal bones (vertebrae). The gene mutations that cause cerebro-facio-thoracic dysplasia lead to production of abnormally short TMCO1 proteins that are likely broken down quickly. Without this protein, TMCO1 channels cannot form, and excess calcium builds up in the endoplasmic reticulum. The imbalance of calcium in this compartment disrupts development of a variety of tissues and organs, including the brain and structures in the head, face, and torso, resulting in the features of cerebro-facio-thoracic dysplasia. "
1368,TMEM70 ,transmembrane protein 70,"The TMEM70 gene provides instructions for making a protein called transmembrane protein 70. This protein is found in cell structures called mitochondria, which convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Transmembrane protein 70 is thought to play an important role in assembling and stabilizing a group of proteins called complex V. Complex V is the last of five complexes that carry out a multistep process called oxidative phosphorylation, through which cells derive much of their energy. Complex V is involved in the final step of oxidative phosphorylation. Specifically, one segment of complex V allows positively charged particles, called protons, to flow across a specialized membrane inside mitochondria. Another segment of complex V uses the energy created by this proton flow to convert a molecule called adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used by the cell as energy.Transmembrane protein 70 is also thought to be involved in the assembly of complex I, which is the first mitochondrial complex involved in oxidative phosphorylation.","Mitochondrial complex V deficiency At least 12 mutations in the TMEM70 gene have been identified in people who have mitochondrial complex V deficiency, a disorder with a wide variety of signs and symptoms. A few of these gene mutations are particular to people of Roma or Arab descent, and account for the majority of mitochondrial complex V deficiency cases caused by TMEM70 gene mutations. This disorder can also be caused by mutations in other genes.The signs and symptoms of mitochondrial complex V deficiency are most prominent in organs and tissues that require a large amount of energy, such as the brain and heart. Abnormal brain function (encephalopathy) and other neurological problems can occur. Another common feature of mitochondrial complex V deficiency, especially when caused by TMEM70 gene mutations, is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This condition is characterized by thickening (hypertrophy) of the heart (cardiac) muscle that can lead to heart failure. TMEM70 gene mutations alter transmembrane protein 70 and impair its ability to perform its function in complex V assembly. As a result, the amount of complex V in cells is reduced. The resulting impairment of oxidative phosphorylation and energy production leads to the signs and symptoms of mitochondrial complex V deficiency. "
1369,TMEM127 ,transmembrane protein 127,"The TMEM127 gene provides instructions for making a protein that acts as a tumor suppressor protein, which means it prevents cells from growing and dividing too quickly or in an uncontrolled way. The TMEM127 protein controls a signaling pathway that leads to cell growth and survival. Research shows that this pathway, regulated by a protein complex called mTORC1, is blocked (inhibited) by the TMEM127 protein, although the specific action of the TMEM127 protein is unknown.","Nonsyndromic paraganglioma Mutations in the TMEM127 gene increase the risk of developing a noncancerous tumor associated with the nervous system called paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma (a type of paraganglioma). TMEM127 gene mutations occur most commonly in people with pheochromocytoma, and they are rarely found in people with other paraganglioma. Specifically, TMEM127 gene mutations are associated with nonsyndromic paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma, which means the tumors occur without additional features of an inherited syndrome. At least 19 TMEM127 gene mutations have been identified in people with one of these tumors. A TMEM127 gene mutation increases the risk of tumor formation. The TMEM127 gene mutations associated with paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the TMEM127 protein sequence or result in a shortened protein.Most people with TMEM127-related paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma acquire an additional mutation that deletes the normal copy of the gene. This second mutation, called a somatic mutation, is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in tumor cells. Together, the two mutations lead to reduced or absent TMEM127 protein. As a result, the cell growth pathway controlled by the TMEM127 protein is abnormally active, leading to tumor formation. "
1370,TMPRSS6 ,transmembrane serine protease 6,"The TMPRSS6 gene provides instructions for making a protein called matriptase-2. This protein is part of a signaling pathway that controls the levels of another protein called hepcidin, which is a key regulator of iron balance in the body. When blood iron levels are low, this signaling pathway reduces hepcidin production, allowing more iron from the diet to be absorbed through the intestines and transported out of storage sites (particularly in the liver and spleen) into the bloodstream. Iron is an essential component of hemoglobin, which is the molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen.","Iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia At least 40 mutations in the TMPRSS6 gene have been found to cause an inherited form of anemia called iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia. This condition is characterized by a shortage (deficiency) of iron in the bloodstream that is resistant (refractory) to treatment with iron.TMPRSS6 gene mutations greatly reduce the amount of functional matriptase-2, preventing it from controlling hepcidin levels. The resulting elevation in hepcidin activity blocks the absorption of iron through the intestines and the release of iron from storage. When not enough iron is available in the bloodstream, less hemoglobin is produced and red blood cells cannot carry oxygen to the body's cells and tissues effectively. The shortage of oxygen causes the signs and symptoms of anemia, which can include tiredness (fatigue), weakness, and pale skin. "
1371,TNFRSF1A ,TNF receptor superfamily member 1A,"The TNFRSF1A gene provides instructions for making a protein called tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1). This protein is found spanning the membrane of cells, with part of the TNFR1 protein outside the cell and part of the protein inside the cell. Outside the cell, the TNFR1 protein attaches (binds) to another protein called tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The interaction of the TNF protein with the TNFR1 protein causes the TNFR1 protein to bind to two other TNFR1 proteins, forming a three-protein complex called a trimer. This trimer formation is necessary for the TNFR1 protein to be functional.The binding of the TNF and TNFR1 proteins causes the TNFR1 protein to send signals inside the cell. Signaling from the TNFR1 protein can trigger either inflammation or self-destruction of the cell (apoptosis). Signaling within the cell initiates a pathway that turns on a protein called nuclear factor kappa B, which triggers inflammation and leads to the production of immune system proteins called cytokines. Apoptosis is initiated when the TNFR1 protein, bound to the TNF protein, is brought into the cell and starts a process known as the caspase cascade.","Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome More than 60 mutations in the TNFRSF1A gene have been found to cause tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (commonly known as TRAPS). Most of these mutations lead to changes in single protein building blocks (amino acids), typically involving the amino acid cysteine. Cysteines contain sulfur atoms that form connections, called disulfide bonds, with other cysteines. Disulfide bonds help a protein fold by connecting cysteines in different regions of the protein. These bonds stabilize the protein and give it the appropriate shape to carry out its particular function.When cysteines within the TNFR1 protein are replaced with other amino acids, the disulfide bonds are not formed, and the protein is misfolded. These misfolded proteins are trapped within the cell, unable to get to the cell surface to interact with TNF. Inside the cell, these proteins clump together and are thought to trigger alternative pathways that initiate inflammation. The clumps of protein constantly activate these alternative inflammation pathways, leading to excess inflammation in people with TRAPS. Additionally, because only one copy of the TNFRSF1A gene has a mutation, some normal TNFR1 proteins are produced and can bind to the TNF protein, leading to additional inflammation. It is unclear if disruption of the apoptosis pathway plays a role in the signs and symptoms of TRAPS.Some people with mutations in the TNFRSF1A gene do not develop TRAPS, or they develop very mild features of the disorder. The reason for this variability is unclear, but researchers believe that other factors, such as additional genetic changes or environmental factors, may play a role in causing TRAPS. "
1372,TNFRSF11A ,TNF receptor superfamily member 11a,"The TNFRSF11A gene provides instructions for making a protein called receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK). This protein plays an important role in bone remodeling, a normal process in which old bone is broken down and new bone is created to replace it. During bone remodeling, RANK helps direct the formation and function of specialized cells called osteoclasts, which break down bone tissue. RANK is located on the surface of immature osteoclasts, where it receives signals that trigger these cells to mature and become fully functional.",Osteopetrosis Genetics Home Reference provides information about osteopetrosis. 
1373,TNFRSF11B ,TNF receptor superfamily member 11b,"The TNFRSF11B gene provides instructions for making a protein called osteoprotegerin. This protein plays an important role in bone remodeling, a normal process in which old bone is broken down and new bone is created to replace it. Osteoprotegerin is involved in the regulation of specialized cells called osteoclasts, which break down bone tissue during bone remodeling.Osteoprotegerin is one of two receptor proteins that can attach (bind) to a protein called receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL). The other receptor protein is called receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK). Because RANKL can only bind to one receptor at a time, osteoprotegerin and RANK compete with one another. When RANKL is bound to RANK, it sets off a series of chemical signals that trigger immature osteoclasts to mature and become fully functional. When RANKL is bound to osteoprotegerin, it blocks these chemical signals and prevents the activation of osteoclasts. Because no chemical signals are transmitted when RANKL is attached to osteoprotegerin, osteoprotegerin is often called a ""decoy"" receptor.By reducing the amount of RANKL that is available to bind to RANK, osteoprotegerin plays a critical role in regulating the process of bone remodeling.","Juvenile Paget disease At least six mutations in the TNFRSF11B gene have been found to cause juvenile Paget disease. Each of these mutations greatly reduces the function of osteoprotegerin or prevents cells from making any of this protein. Without osteoprotegerin, RANKL binds only to RANK. The resulting increase in chemical signaling stimulates the production of too many osteoclasts and triggers these cells to break down bone abnormally. In people with juvenile Paget disease, bone is broken down and replaced much faster than usual. When the new bone tissue grows, it is weaker and less organized than normal bone. These problems with bone remodeling cause bones throughout the skeleton to become unusually large, misshapen, and easily broken (fractured). "
1374,TNFRSF13B ,TNF receptor superfamily member 13B,"The TNFRSF13B gene provides instructions for making a protein called TACI. The TACI protein is found on the surface of immune system cells called B cells. These specialized white blood cells help protect the body against infection from foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. When B cells mature, they produce special proteins called antibodies (also known as immunoglobulins). Antibodies attach to specific foreign invaders, marking them for destruction. Through interactions with other proteins, TACI promotes cell signaling, plays a role in B cell survival and maturation, and is involved in the production of antibodies.","Common variable immune deficiency More than 25 mutations in the TNFRSF13B gene have been associated with common variable immune deficiency (CVID). This condition impairs the immune system, resulting in increased risk for recurrent infections; autoimmune disorders, which occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's tissues and organs; and certain cancers.Most of the TNFRSF13B gene mutations associated with CVID change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the TACI protein. The most common mutation seen in people with CVID replaces the amino acid cysteine with the amino acid arginine at position 104 in the TACI protein (written as Cys104Arg or C104R). This mutation impairs the ability of TACI to interact with other proteins, disrupting cell signaling and preventing normal B cell maturation and antibody production. A shortage (deficiency) of certain antibodies makes it difficult for people to fight off infections. Abnormal and deficient immune responses over time likely contribute to the increased cancer risk in people with CVID.Some people with TNFRSF13B gene mutations do not develop the signs and symptoms of CVID. In these individuals, additional genetic or environmental factors are probably needed for the condition to occur. "
1375,TNNI2 ,"troponin I2, fast skeletal type","The TNNI2 gene provides instructions for making one form of a protein called troponin I. The troponin I protein produced from the TNNI2 gene is found in skeletal muscles, which are the muscles used for movement. Troponin I is one of three proteins that make up the troponin complex in muscle cells. The troponin complex, along with calcium, helps regulate muscle tensing (contraction).The troponin complex is part of a structure called the sarcomere, which is the basic unit of muscle contraction. Sarcomeres contain thick and thin filaments. The overlapping thick and thin filaments attach (bind) to each other and release, which allows the filaments to move relative to one another so that muscles can contract.When calcium levels are low, the troponin complex blocks the binding between the thick and thin filaments that is needed for muscle contraction. An increase in calcium levels causes structural changes in the troponin complex, which exposes the binding sites and allows the thick and thin filaments to interact, leading to muscle contraction.","Sheldon-Hall syndrome At least eight TNNI2 gene mutations have been identified in people with Sheldon-Hall syndrome. This disorder affects muscle and skeletal development before birth and is characterized by joint deformities (contractures) that restrict movement in the hands and feet. Researchers suggest that the TNNI2 gene mutations that cause Sheldon-Hall syndrome may prevent the troponin complex from blocking thick and thin filament binding to control muscle contractions, resulting in the contractures and other muscle and skeletal abnormalities associated with Sheldon-Hall syndrome. "
1376,TNNI3 ,"troponin I3, cardiac type","The TNNI3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cardiac troponin I, which is found solely in the heart (cardiac) muscle. Cardiac troponin I is one of three proteins that make up the troponin protein complex in cardiac muscle cells. The troponin complex is associated with a structure called the sarcomere, which is the basic unit of muscle contraction. Sarcomeres are made up of thick and thin filaments. The overlapping thick and thin filaments attach (bind) to each other and release, which allows the filaments to move relative to one another so that muscles can contract. The troponin complex, along with calcium, helps regulate tensing (contraction) of cardiac muscle.For the heart to beat normally, cardiac muscle must contract and relax in a coordinated way. Cardiac troponin I helps to coordinate contraction of the heart. When calcium levels are low, the troponin complex binds to the thin filament. This binding blocks the interaction between the thick and thin filaments that is needed for muscle contraction. An increase in calcium levels causes structural changes in another troponin complex protein called troponin C, which then triggers the troponin complex to detach from the thin filament, allowing the heart muscle to contract.","Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Mutations in the TNNI3 gene can cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a condition characterized by thickening (hypertrophy) of the cardiac muscle. TNNI3 gene mutations are found in less than 5 percent of people with this condition. Although some people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have no obvious health effects, all affected individuals have an increased risk of heart failure and sudden death.Most TNNI3 gene mutations in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the cardiac troponin I protein. The altered protein is likely incorporated into the troponin complex, but it may not function properly. It is unclear how these mutations lead to the features of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.In some people, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy develops into restrictive cardiomyopathy (described below), although it can be difficult to distinguish these two disorders. "
1377,TNNT2 ,"troponin T2, cardiac type","The TNNT2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cardiac troponin T, which is found solely in the heart (cardiac) muscle. Cardiac troponin T is one of three proteins that make up the troponin protein complex in cardiac muscle cells. The troponin complex is part of a structure called the sarcomere, which is the basic unit of muscle contraction. Sarcomeres are made up of thick and thin filaments. The overlapping thick and thin filaments attach (bind) to each other and release, which allows the filaments to move relative to one another so that muscles can contract.

Cardiac troponin T helps coordinate contraction of the heart muscle. When calcium levels are low, the troponin complex binds to the thin filament in sarcomeres, which blocks the interaction between the thick and thin filaments that is needed for muscle contraction. An increase in calcium levels causes structural changes in the troponin complex, which allows the thick and thin filaments to interact, leading to contraction of the heart muscle.","Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Mutations in the TNNT2 gene can cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a condition characterized by thickening (hypertrophy) of the cardiac muscle. TNNT2 gene mutations are found in approximately 5 percent of individuals with this condition. Although some people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have no obvious health effects, all affected individuals have an increased risk of heart failure and sudden death.Most TNNT2 gene mutations in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the cardiac troponin T protein. The altered protein is likely incorporated into the troponin complex, but it may not function properly. However, it is unclear how the gene mutations lead to the features of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. "
1378,TNNT3 ,"troponin T3, fast skeletal type","The TNNT3 gene provides instructions for making one form of a protein called troponin T. The troponin T protein produced from the TNNT3 gene is found in skeletal muscles, which are the muscles used for movement. Troponin T is one of three proteins that make up the troponin complex in muscle cells.

This disorder affects muscle and skeletal development before birth and is characterized by joint deformities (contractures) that restrict movement in the hands and feet. The TNNT3 gene mutations that cause Sheldon-Hall syndrome may prevent the troponin complex from blocking thick and thin filament binding to control muscle contractions, resulting in the contractures and other muscle and skeletal abnormalities associated with Sheldon-Hall syndrome. "
1379,TNXB ,tenascin XB,"The TNXB gene provides instructions for making a protein called tenascin-X. This protein plays an important role in organizing and maintaining the structure of tissues that support the body's muscles, joints, organs, and skin (connective tissues). In particular, studies suggest that it helps to regulate the production and assembly of certain types of collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support connective tissues throughout the body. Tenascin-X is also involved in regulating the structure and stability of elastic fibers, which provide flexibility and stretchiness (elasticity) to connective tissues.","Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Mutations in the TNXB gene cause a very small percentage of all cases of a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome called the hypermobile type. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect the connective tissues that support the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues. The hypermobile type is characterized by an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility). The mutations that cause this form of the disorder occur in one copy of the TNXB gene in each cell. These mutations reduce the amount of functional tenascin-X that cells produce, which decreases the ability of tenascin-X to interact with collagens and elastic fibers. These changes weaken connective tissues in many parts of the body, which results in the signs and symptoms of the hypermobile type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.Some people with a condition called benign joint hypermobility syndrome (BJHS) also make a reduced amount of tenascin-X protein, although no TNXB gene mutations have been identified in these individuals. This condition causes hypermobility and chronic joint pain. The signs and symptoms of benign joint hypermobility syndrome overlap significantly with those of the hypermobile type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Studies suggest that they may be forms of the same condition.Some people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome have mutations in two copies of the TNXB gene in each cell. These individuals have a form of the disorder that is often called the classical-like type. Its signs and symptoms are similar to the classical type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, including hypermobility and skin that is soft, highly stretchy (elastic), and fragile. However, affected individuals do not have the unusual scarring that is characteristic of that type. Mutations that occur in both copies of the TNXB gene prevent production of any tenascin-X protein. A loss of this protein severely disrupts the organization of collagen fibrils and elastic fibers, which significantly weakens connective tissues. "
1380,TOR1A ,torsin family 1 member A,"The TOR1A gene (also known as DYT1) provides instructions for making a protein called torsinA. This protein is found in the space between two neighboring structures within cells, the nuclear envelope and the endoplasmic reticulum. The nuclear envelope surrounds the nucleus and separates it from the rest of the cell. The endoplasmic reticulum processes proteins and other molecules and helps transport them to specific destinations either inside or outside the cell. Although little is known about the function of torsinA, studies suggest that it may help process and transport other proteins. TorsinA may also participate in the movement of membranes associated with the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum.TorsinA is active in many of the body's tissues, and it is particularly important for the normal function of nerve cells in the brain. For example, researchers have found high levels of torsinA in a part of the brain called the substantia nigra. This region contains nerve cells that produce dopamine, a chemical messenger that transmits signals within the brain to produce smooth physical movements.","Early-onset primary dystonia A particular mutation in the TOR1A gene causes most cases of early-onset primary dystonia. This mutation, which is often called the GAG deletion or delta GAG, deletes three DNA building blocks (base pairs) from the TOR1A gene. The resulting torsinA protein is missing one protein building block (amino acid) in a critical region. The altered protein's effect on the function of nerve cells in the brain is unclear. People with early-onset primary dystonia do not have a loss of nerve cells or obvious changes in the structure of the brain that would explain the abnormal muscle contractions seen with this condition. Instead, the altered torsinA protein may have subtle effects on the connections between nerve cells and likely disrupts chemical signaling between nerve cells that control movement. Researchers are working to determine how a change in this protein leads to the characteristic features of this disorder. "
1381,TP53 ,tumor protein p53,"The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein called tumor protein p53 (or p53). This protein acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it regulates cell division by keeping cells from growing and dividing (proliferating) too fast or in an uncontrolled way.The p53 protein is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. When the DNA in a cell becomes damaged by agents such as toxic chemicals, radiation, or ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight, this protein plays a critical role in determining whether the DNA will be repaired or the damaged cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). If the DNA can be repaired, p53 activates other genes to fix the damage. If the DNA cannot be repaired, this protein prevents the cell from dividing and signals it to undergo apoptosis. By stopping cells with mutated or damaged DNA from dividing, p53 helps prevent the development of tumors.Because p53 is essential for regulating DNA repair and cell division, it has been nicknamed the ""guardian of the genome.""","Breast cancer Inherited changes in the TP53 gene greatly increase the risk of developing breast cancer, as well as several other forms of cancer, as part of a rare cancer syndrome called Li-Fraumeni syndrome (described below). These mutations are thought to account for only a small fraction of all breast cancer cases.Noninherited (somatic) mutations in the TP53 gene are much more common than inherited mutations, occurring in 20 to 40 percent of all breast cancers. These somatic mutations are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in cells that become cancerous. The cancers associated with somatic mutations do not occur as part of a cancer syndrome. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the p53 protein, which reduces or eliminates the protein's tumor suppressor function. This altered p53 protein cannot regulate cell proliferation effectively. Specifically, it is unable to trigger apoptosis in cells with mutated or damaged DNA. As a result, DNA damage can accumulate in cells. Such cells may continue to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to tumor growth.Compared with breast cancers without TP53 gene mutations, tumors with these genetic changes tend to have a poorer prognosis: They are more likely to be aggressive, to be resistant to treatment with certain anti-cancer drugs and radiation, and to come back (recur) after treatment. "
1382,TP63 ,tumor protein p63,"The TP63 gene provides instructions for making a protein called tumor protein p63 (also known simply as p63). The p63 protein functions as a transcription factor, which means it attaches (binds) to certain regions of DNA and controls the activity of particular genes.The p63 protein interacts with other proteins to turn many different genes on and off at different times. The action of p63 helps regulate numerous cell activities, including cell growth and division (proliferation), cell maintenance, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), the ability of cells to stick to one another (cell adhesion), and the orderly self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).The p63 protein plays a critical role in early development. It is especially important for the normal development of ectodermal structures, such as the skin, hair, teeth, and nails. Studies suggest that it also plays essential roles in the development of the limbs, facial features, urinary system, and other organs and tissues. In addition to its roles in development, the p63 protein appears to be necessary for the maintenance of various cells and tissues later in life.","Ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate syndrome At least 40 mutations in the TP63 gene have been identified in people with ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate (AEC) syndrome. This condition is a form of ectodermal dysplasia, which is a group of disorders characterized by abnormal development of the skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands. Other characteristic features of AEC syndrome include partial or complete fusion of the upper and lower eyelids (ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum) and an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate), a split in the lip (a cleft lip), or both.Most of the TP63 gene mutations responsible for AEC syndrome occur in regions of the p63 protein known as the sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain and the transactivation inhibitory (TI) domain. Mutations in these regions interfere with the ability of p63 to turn target genes on and off at the right times. However, it is unclear how these changes lead to abnormal ectodermal development and the specific features of AEC syndrome. "
1383,TPI1 ,triosephosphate isomerase 1,"The TPI1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called triosephosphate isomerase 1. This enzyme is involved in a critical energy-producing process known as glycolysis. During glycolysis, the simple sugar glucose is broken down to produce energy for cells. The triosephosphate isomerase 1 enzyme carries out a specific reaction during glycolysis: the conversion of a molecule called dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. This conversion can go both ways, meaning that the triosephosphate isomerase 1 enzyme can also convert glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate back into DHAP. Additional steps convert glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate into other molecules that ultimately produce energy in the form of a molecule called ATP.For the triosephosphate isomerase 1 enzyme to be turned on (active), it has to attach (bind) to another triosephosphate isomerase 1 enzyme, forming a two-enzyme complex called a dimer.","Triosephosphate isomerase deficiency At least 12 mutations in the TPI1 gene have been found to cause triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. This condition is characterized by a shortage of red blood cells (anemia), movement problems, increased susceptibility to infection, and muscle weakness that can affect breathing and heart function.TPI1 gene mutations can lead to the production of an enzyme with decreased activity. As a result, glycolysis is impaired and cells have a decreased supply of energy. One TPI1 gene mutation accounts for approximately 80 percent of triosephosphate isomerase deficiency cases. This change replaces the protein building block (amino acid) glutamic acid with the amino acid aspartic acid at position 104 in the triosephosphate isomerase 1 enzyme (written as Glu104Asp or E104D). This mutation causes the enzyme to be unstable and impairs its ability to form a dimer and become active.Red blood cells depend solely on the breakdown of glucose for energy. Without functional triosephosphate isomerase 1 enzyme to convert DHAP to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, red blood cells accumulate DHAP, which is toxic in large quantities. Unlike other cells, red blood cells do not have alternative pathways to break down DHAP. Due to the buildup of DHAP and the lack of cellular energy, red blood cells die earlier than normal.Cells with high energy demands, such as nerve cells in the brain, white blood cells, and heart (cardiac) muscle cells are also susceptible to cell death due to reduced energy caused by impaired glycolysis. Nerve cells in the part of the brain involved in coordinating movements (the cerebellum) are particularly affected in people with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. Death of red and white blood cells, nerve cells in the brain, and cardiac muscle cells leads to the signs and symptoms of triosephosphate isomerase deficiency. "
1384,TPM2 ,tropomyosin 2,"The TPM2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called beta (β)-tropomyosin, which is part of the tropomyosin protein family. Tropomyosin proteins regulate the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction) by controlling the binding of two muscle proteins, myosin and actin. In non-muscle cells, tropomyosin proteins play a role in controlling cell shape.β-tropomyosin is found primarily in skeletal muscles, which are the muscles used for movement. This protein helps regulate muscle contraction by interacting with other muscle proteins, particularly myosin and actin. These interactions are essential for stabilizing and maintaining structures called sarcomeres within muscle cells. Sarcomeres are the basic units of muscle contraction; they are made of proteins that generate the mechanical force needed for muscles to contract.","Cap myopathy At least three TPM2 gene mutations have been identified in people with cap myopathy, a disorder that leads to muscle weakness (myopathy) and poor muscle tone (hypotonia). These mutations delete or duplicate genetic material in the TPM2 gene or replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the β-tropomyosin protein sequence. The specific effects of these TPM2 gene mutations are unclear, but researchers suggest they may interfere with normal actin-myosin binding, impairing muscle contraction and resulting in the muscle weakness that occurs in cap myopathy. "
1385,TPM3 ,tropomyosin 3,"The TPM3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called slow muscle alpha (α)-tropomyosin, which is part of the tropomyosin protein family. Tropomyosin proteins regulate the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction) by controlling the binding of two muscle proteins, myosin and actin. In non-muscle cells, tropomyosin proteins play a role in controlling cell shape.Slow muscle α-tropomyosin is found in skeletal muscles, which are the muscles used for movement. Skeletal muscle is made up of two types of muscle fibers: type I (slow twitch fibers) and type II (fast twitch fibers). Slow muscle α-tropomyosin is found only in type I fibers. Type I fibers are the primary component of skeletal muscles that are resistant to fatigue. For example, muscles involved in posture, such as the neck muscles that hold the head steady, are made predominantly of type I fibers. Slow muscle α-tropomyosin helps regulate muscle contraction in type I skeletal muscle fibers.","Cap myopathy At least two TPM3 gene mutations have been identified in people with cap myopathy. These mutations replace the protein building block (amino acid) arginine with the amino acids cysteine or histidine at position 168 of the protein sequence, written as Arg168Cys or Arg168His (also written as R168C or R168H). The specific effects of these TPM3 gene mutations are unclear, but researchers suggest they may interfere with normal actin-myosin binding, impairing muscle contraction and resulting in the muscle weakness that occurs in cap myopathy. "
1386,TPMT ,thiopurine S-methyltransferase,"The TPMT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT). This enzyme carries out a specific chemical reaction called S-methylation of a group of molecules known as aromatic and heterocyclic sulphydryl compounds. This function is of particular interest because it is critical for breaking down (metabolizing) drugs called thiopurines. These drugs, which include 6-thioguanine, 6-mercaptopurine, and azathioprine, inhibit (suppress) the body's immune system. They are used to treat several forms of cancer and other disorders involving immune system malfunction, such as Crohn disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Thiopurine drugs are also used in organ transplant recipients to help prevent the immune system from attacking the transplanted organ.Once inside the body, thiopurine drugs are converted to toxic compounds that kill immune system cells in the bone marrow. The TPMT enzyme ""turns off"" thiopurine drugs by metabolizing them to inactive, nontoxic compounds.","Thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficiency Changes in the TPMT gene cause TPMT deficiency, which is a reduction in the activity of the TPMT enzyme. Without enough of this enzyme, the body cannot ""turn off"" thiopurine drugs by metabolizing them into inactive compounds. The drugs stay in the body longer and continue to destroy cells unchecked, which leads to bone marrow damage (hematopoietic toxicity). This damage causes myelosuppression, which is an inability of the bone marrow to make enough red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. A shortage of these cells can cause a variety of health problems, the most serious of which include abnormal bleeding and an increased risk of potentially life-threatening infections. Although hematopoietic toxicity can occur in anyone who takes thiopurine drugs, people with TPMT deficiency are at highest risk of this complication.The TPMT gene can be classified as either low-activity or high-activity. When the gene is altered in a way that impairs the activity of the TPMT enzyme, it is described as low-activity. When the gene is unaltered and TPMT activity is normal, it is described as high-activity. Because two copies of the gene are present in each cell, each person can have two low-activity copies, one low-activity copy and one high-activity copy, or two high-activity copies. People with two low-activity copies of the TPMT gene in each cell have TPMT deficiency and are at the greatest risk of developing hematopoietic toxicity when treated with thiopurine drugs unless they are given much less than the usual dose. People with one high-activity copy and one low-activity copy have moderately reduced enzyme activity and are also at increased risk of this complication unless given a significantly lower dose of the drug. People with two high-activity copies have normal TPMT activity and do not have an increased risk of hematopoietic toxicity with thiopurine drug treatment.More than 40 low-activity versions (alleles) of the TPMT gene have been found in people with TPMT deficiency. Each of these alleles includes one or more changes in the gene that reduce the stability and activity of the TPMT enzyme. Two particular alleles, TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C, underlie more than 90 percent of cases of the condition. Studies suggest that TPMT*3A is the most common low-activity allele in whites, while TPMT*3C is the most common low-activity allele in Asians, Africans, and African Americans. "
1387,TPO ,thyroid peroxidase,"The TPO gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called thyroid peroxidase. This enzyme plays a central role in the function of the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped tissue in the lower neck. Thyroid peroxidase assists the chemical reaction that adds iodine to a protein called thyroglobulin, a critical step in generating thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones play an important role in regulating growth, brain development, and the rate of chemical reactions in the body (metabolism).To function properly, thyroid peroxidase must be located in the cell membrane of certain thyroid cells, called follicular cells. Thyroid peroxidase has several different versions (isoforms), which vary by size and location within the cell. Some versions do not function because they are not located in the cell membrane.","Congenital hypothyroidism TPO gene mutations can cause congenital hypothyroidism, a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of thyroid hormones starting from birth. The TPO gene mutations involved in this condition delete, add, or change DNA building blocks (base pairs) in the TPO gene. Some mutations lead to an abnormally small thyroid peroxidase enzyme that breaks apart before it can be inserted into the cell membrane. Other mutations change the enzyme's 3-dimensional shape, preventing it from functioning properly within the cell membrane. Without functional thyroid peroxidase, iodine taken up by the thyroid gland is not added to thyroglobulin. As a result, the production of thyroid hormones is absent or reduced, leading to the features of congenital hypothyroidism. In most affected individuals, the thyroid gland is enlarged (goiter) in an attempt to compensate for reduced hormone production. Because cases caused by TPO gene mutations result from a disruption of thyroid hormone synthesis, they are classified as thyroid dyshormonogenesis. "
1388,TPP1 ,tripeptidyl peptidase 1,"The TPP1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called tripeptidyl peptidase 1. This enzyme is produced as an inactive enzyme, called a proenzyme, which has an extra segment attached. This segment must be removed, followed by additional processing steps, for the enzyme to become active. The active tripeptidyl peptidase 1 enzyme is found in cell structures called lysosomes, which digest and recycle different types of molecules. Tripeptidyl peptidase 1 acts as a peptidase, which means that it breaks down protein fragments, known as peptides, into their individual building blocks (amino acids). Specifically, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 cuts (cleaves) peptides into groups of three amino acids.","CLN2 disease At least 115 mutations in the TPP1 gene have been found to cause CLN2 disease. This condition impairs motor and mental development, typically starting in early childhood, causing gradually worsening movement disorders and a decline in intellectual function. In addition, affected children often develop recurrent seizures (epilepsy) and vision impairment. In some cases, signs and symptoms of CLN2 disease do not appear until later in childhood, usually after age 4.Most of the TPP1 gene mutations that cause CLN2 disease change single amino acids in tripeptidyl peptidase 1, resulting in a severe decrease in enzyme activity. A reduction in functional enzyme results in the incomplete breakdown of certain peptides. CLN2 disease is characterized by the accumulation of proteins or peptides and other substances in lysosomes. These accumulations occur in cells throughout the body; however, nerve cells seem to be particularly vulnerable to their effects. The accumulations can cause cell damage leading to cell death. The progressive death of nerve cells in the brain and other tissues leads to the signs and symptoms of CLN2 disease.Individuals who are diagnosed with CLN2 disease later in childhood likely have TPP1 gene mutations that result in the production of an enzyme with a small amount of normal function. Protein function in these individuals is higher than in those who have the condition beginning earlier in childhood. As a result, it takes longer for peptides and other substances to accumulate in the lysosomes and damage nerve cells. "
1389,TRAPPC2 ,trafficking protein particle complex 2,"The TRAPPC2 gene provides instructions for producing the protein sedlin, which is found in cells throughout the body. Sedlin is part of a large group of proteins called the trafficking protein particle (TRAPP) complex, which plays a role in the transport of proteins between cell compartments (organelles). Sedlin is thought to be located between two organelles, the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. The endoplasmic reticulum is involved in protein processing and transport, and the Golgi apparatus modifies newly produced proteins.Research shows that sedlin is required for transporting large proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. For example, sedlin is needed to move large molecules called procollagens out of the endoplasmic reticulum so they can be processed further by the Golgi apparatus. Later, procollagens are altered by enzymes outside the cell to create smaller mature collagen proteins, which strengthen and support connective tissues, such as skin, bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments.","X-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda More than 50 mutations in the TRAPPC2 gene have been found to cause X-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda. This condition impairs bone growth and occurs almost exclusively in males, usually appearing between ages 6 and 10. Almost all mutations result in a nonfunctional sedlin protein. As a result, large proteins, including procollagen, cannot be transported out of the endoplasmic reticulum. A lack of procollagen transport reduces the amount of mature collagen in cells, which impairs the development of bones, cartilage, and other connective tissues. It is likely that this disruption in bone development leads to many of the signs and symptoms of X-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda, although it is unclear why the skeletal problems do not appear until later in childhood. "
1390,TREM2 ,triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2,"The TREM2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2. As its name suggests, this protein is made in myeloid cells, which are cells produced in bone marrow. The TREM2 protein is found on the cell surface, where it interacts with the protein produced from the TYROBP gene. The TREM2 and TYROBP proteins form a complex that transmits chemical signals to activate the cell.The TYROBP-TREM2 complex was first identified in the immune system. This complex is involved in the growth and development of several types of immune cells, particularly dendritic cells. The TYROBP-TREM2 complex activates these cells, triggering an inflammatory response to injury or disease.The TYROBP-TREM2 complex also activates cells in the skeletal system and in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). In the skeletal system, the complex is found in osteoclasts, which are specialized cells that break down and remove (resorb) bone tissue that is no longer needed. These cells are involved in bone remodeling, which is a normal process that replaces old bone tissue with new bone. In the central nervous system, the complex appears to play an important role in immune cells called microglia. These cells protect the brain and spinal cord from foreign invaders and remove dead nerve cells and other debris. Although the TYROBP-TREM2 complex plays a critical role in osteoclasts and microglia, its exact function in these cells is unclear","Polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy At least 10 mutations in the TREM2 gene have been identified in people with polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy (commonly known as PLOSL). Some mutations prevent the cell from making any TREM2 protein, while others result in the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the protein. Still other mutations change the structure of the TREM2 protein, preventing it from reaching the cell surface.Researchers believe that the signs and symptoms of PLOSL are related to defective TYROBP-TREM2 signaling in osteoclasts and microglia. The bone abnormalities seen with this disorder are probably related to malfunctioning osteoclasts, which are less able to resorb bone tissue during bone remodeling. In the central nervous system, defective signaling through the TYROBP-TREM2 complex causes widespread abnormalities of microglia. Researchers are working to determine how these abnormalities lead to the neurological problems associated with PLOSL. "
1391,TREX1 ,three prime repair exonuclease 1,"The TREX1 gene provides instructions for making the 3-prime repair exonuclease 1 enzyme. This enzyme is a DNA exonuclease, which means that it trims molecules of DNA by removing DNA building blocks (nucleotides) from the ends of the molecules. In this way, it breaks down unneeded DNA molecules or fragments that may be generated during copying (replication) of cells' genetic material in preparation for cell division. These fragments may also be generated during DNA repair, cell death (apoptosis), and other processes.","Aicardi-Goutières syndrome At least 82 mutations in the TREX1 gene have been identified in people with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, a disorder that involves severe brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), skin lesions, and other health problems. Most of these mutations are believed to prevent the production of the 3-prime repair exonuclease 1 enzyme. Researchers suggest that the absence of this enzyme results in an accumulation of unneeded DNA and RNA in cells. These DNA and RNA molecules may be mistaken by cells for the genetic material of viral invaders, triggering immune system reactions that damage the brain, skin, and other organs and systems and result in the signs and symptoms of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. "
1392,TRIP11 ,thyroid hormone receptor interactor 11,"The TRIP11 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as Golgi microtubule-associated protein 210 (GMAP-210). This protein is found in the Golgi apparatus, a cell structure in which newly produced proteins are modified so they can carry out their functions. Studies suggest that the GMAP-210 protein helps to maintain the structure of the Golgi apparatus, and it may also be involved in the transport of certain proteins out of cells.Although the GMAP-210 protein is found throughout the body, researchers suspect that it may have a particularly important role in cells called chondrocytes in the developing skeleton. Chondrocytes give rise to cartilage, a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears.","Achondrogenesis At least nine mutations in the TRIP11 gene have been found to cause a form of achondrogenesis known as type 1A or the Houston-Harris type. This rare disorder of bone development is characterized by extremely short limbs, a narrow chest, short ribs that fracture easily, and a lack of normal bone formation (ossification) in the skull, spine, and pelvis. Serious health problems result from these abnormalities, and infants with achondrogenesis usually die before or soon after birth.The TRIP11 gene mutations associated with achondrogenesis type 1A lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of the GMAP-210 protein or prevent the cell from producing any of this protein. Studies suggest that a shortage of GMAP-210 activity alters the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus, which impairs protein modification. Chondrocytes appear to be particularly sensitive to these changes, and malfunction of the Golgi apparatus in these cells likely underlies the problems with bone formation in achondrogenesis type 1A. "
1393,TRIP13 ,thyroid hormone receptor interactor 13,"The TRIP13 gene provides instructions for making a protein that has several roles in cell division. One important role is to help ensure proper chromosome separation when cells divide. Before cells divide, they must copy all of their chromosomes. The copied DNA from each chromosome is arranged into two identical structures, called sister chromatids, which are attached to one another during the early stages of cell division. The sets of chromosomes align within the cell, with each chromatid attached to a structure called a spindle microtubule; when all chromatids are correctly attached, the spindle microtubule pulls the two halves of the chromatid pair to opposite sides of the cell. The cell then divides in two such that each new cell contains one complete set of chromosomes.Cells have a mechanism, called the spindle assembly checkpoint, that delays cell division until each sister chromatid is attached to a spindle microtubule. The TRIP13 protein appears to regulate this checkpoint, although the exact mechanism is unclear.","Mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome At least two TRIP13 gene mutations have been found to cause mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA) syndrome. This condition is typically characterized by cells with abnormal numbers of chromosomes, a situation known as aneuploidy. Individuals with MVA syndrome caused by TRIP13 gene mutations have a high risk of developing a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor in childhood. They may also grow slowly and have an unusually small head size (microcephaly).TRIP13 gene mutations involved in MVA syndrome lead to production of an abnormally short protein that is quickly broken down. As a result, cells lack TRIP13 protein. A shortage of this protein impairs the spindle assembly checkpoint, and cell division proceeds, even if not all the chromatids are attached to spindle microtubules. Unattached chromatids are not positioned correctly for separation, and the resulting cells often have abnormal numbers of chromosomes. Some people with TRIP13 gene mutations have chromosome abnormalities that indicate problems with chromatid separation, although they do not have abnormal numbers of chromosomes in their cells. These individuals have the other signs and symptoms of MVA syndrome.Research suggests that problems with the spindle assembly checkpoint underlie the development of cancer in MVA syndrome, although the mechanism is not completely understood. It is also unclear how TRIP13 gene mutations lead to other features of MVA syndrome. Researchers speculate that the abnormal cells undergo self-destruction (apoptosis). The signs and symptoms of MVA syndrome may be due to the loss of cells from various tissues during early development. "
1394,TRNT1 ,tRNA nucleotidyl transferase 1,"The TRNT1 gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in the production (synthesis) of other proteins. During protein synthesis, a molecule called transfer RNA (tRNA) helps assemble protein building blocks (amino acids) into a chain that forms the protein. Each tRNA carries a specific amino acid to the growing chain. The TRNT1 protein modifies tRNAs by adding a series of three DNA building blocks (nucleotides), called a CCA trinucleotide, to the molecule. This modification is essential for the correct amino acid to be attached to each tRNA.While most protein synthesis occurs in the fluid surrounding the nucleus (cytoplasm), some proteins are synthesized in cell structures called mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers in cells. Many mitochondrial proteins form groups (complexes) that carry out the reactions that produce energy. Separate tRNA molecules are used to build proteins in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. The TRNT1 protein attaches the CCA trinucleotide to both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNA molecules.","TRNT1 deficiency More than 20 TRNT1 gene mutations have been found to cause TRNT1 deficiency, a condition with a range of signs and symptoms that affect many body systems. Features can include a blood disorder called sideroblastic anemia, recurrent fevers, a shortage of immune cells called B cells that leads to impairment of the immune system (immunodeficiency), delayed development of speech and motor skills, and eye abnormalities that cause vision problems. The severity of the condition varies among affected individuals.The TRNT1 gene mutations that cause TRNT1 deficiency lead to a shortage (deficiency) of functional TRNT1 protein. As a result, the addition of the CCA trinucleotide to tRNA molecules is impaired. Researchers suspect that without the modification, tRNAs are less able to participate in protein synthesis. Studies show that deficiency of TRNT1 prevents the formation of certain mitochondrial protein complexes that are involved in energy production. It is unclear if cytoplasmic protein synthesis is also affected. The reduction of energy could damage cells in many body systems, leading to the varied signs and symptoms of TRNT1 deficiency. Researchers believe that mutations that cause a greater impairment of TRNT1 function lead to more severe signs and symptoms. "
1395,TRPM1 ,transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 1,"The TRPM1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 1 (TRPM1). This protein acts as a channel, transporting positively charged atoms (cations) into cells. The TRPM1 channel is found on the surface of two types of cells: pigment-producing cells called melanocytes and specialized bipolar cells in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina).In melanocytes, the TRPM1 channel is thought to play a role in the production of a pigment called melanin, which is the substance that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color (pigmentation). It is unclear what role the channel plays, but increased channel activity is associated with greater melanin production and darker pigmentation.In bipolar cells, TRPM1 channels are involved in the pathway that receives visual signals from cells called rods, which are used to see in low light. This signaling is an essential step in the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain. In low-light conditions, visual signals from rod cells trigger the TRPM1 channels to close, which causes visual signals to be transmitted. In bright-light conditions, the TRPM1 channel is open, allowing cations to flow in and out of bipolar cells and preventing visual signals from being sent.","Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness More than 35 mutations in the TRPM1 gene have been found to cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness, which is characterized by the inability to see in low light and other vision problems such as nearsightedness (myopia). Mutations in the TRPM1 gene are found in approximately half of all people with this condition.Most TRPM1 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the TRPM1 channel and either alter the structure of the channel or prevent the channel from reaching the bipolar cell membrane. As a result, the TRPM1 channel is nonfunctional and prevents bipolar cells from relaying visual signals. The brain does not receive the visual information sent by rods, leading to difficulty seeing in low light. "
1396,TRPM4 ,transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 4,"The TRPM4 gene provides instructions for making a protein called transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 4 (TRPM4). This protein acts as a channel, opening and closing at specific times to control the flow of positively charged atoms (cations) into and out of cells. The TRPM4 channel is embedded in the outer membrane of cells throughout the body, but it is abundant in heart (cardiac) cells and plays key roles in these cells' ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. TRPM4 channels play a major role in signaling the start of each heartbeat, coordinating the contractions of the upper and lower chambers of the heart, and maintaining a normal heart rhythm.In addition to regulating electric signaling in the heart, the TRPM4 channel is important for the normal functioning of the immune system, the nervous system, the kidneys, and the pancreas.","Progressive familial heart block A few mutations in the TRPM4 gene have been found to cause progressive familial heart block. This condition alters the normal beating of the heart and can lead to fainting (syncope) or sudden cardiac arrest and death. The TRPM4 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the TRPM4 channel. The altered channels have increased activity at the cell membrane, which likely alters the cell's ability to generate electrical signals because of the increased cation flow. Cardiac cells with these altered channels have difficulty producing and transmitting electrical signals that coordinate normal heartbeats. Interruption of this signaling causes heart block. Death of these impaired cardiac cells over time can lead to a buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis), worsening the heart block. "
1397,TRPM6 ,transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 6,"The TRPM6 gene provides instructions for making a protein that acts as a channel, which allows charged atoms (ions) of magnesium (Mg2+) to flow into cells; the channel may also allow small amounts of calcium ions (Ca2+) to pass through cells. Magnesium is involved in many cell processes, including production of cellular energy, maintenance of DNA building blocks (nucleotides), protein production, and cell growth and death. Additionally, Mg2+ is needed for the production of a substance called parathyroid hormone that regulates blood calcium levels. Magnesium and calcium are also required for the normal functioning of nerve cells that control muscle movement (motor neurons).The TRPM6 channel is embedded in the membrane of epithelial cells that line the large intestine, structures in the kidneys known as distal convoluted tubules, the lungs, and the testes in males. When the body needs additional Mg2+, the TRPM6 channel allows it to be absorbed in the intestine and filtered from the fluids that pass through the kidneys by the distal convoluted tubules. When the body has sufficient or too much Mg2+, the TRPM6 channel does not filter out the Mg2+ from fluids but allows the ion to be released from the kidney cells into the urine. The channel also helps to regulate Ca2+, but to a lesser degree.","Hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia At least 38 mutations in the TRPM6 gene have been found to cause hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia. This condition is characterized by low levels of magnesium (hypomagnesemia) and calcium (hypocalcemia) in the body, which leads to neurological problems that begin in infancy, including muscle spasms and seizures. TRPM6 gene mutations result in a lack of functional protein.Nonfunctional TRPM6 channels prevent Mg2+ absorption in the intestine and cause too much Mg2+ to be released in the urine. A lack of Mg2+ in the blood impairs the production of parathyroid hormone, which likely reduces blood Ca2+ levels. Additionally, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia can disrupt many cell processes and impair the function of motor neurons, leading to neurological problems and movement disorders characteristic of this condition. If the condition is not effectively treated and low Mg2+ levels persist, signs and symptoms can worsen over time and may lead to early death. "
1398,TRPS1 ,transcriptional repressor GATA binding 1,"The TRPS1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that regulates the activity of many other genes. The TRPS1 protein is found within the cell nucleus where it interacts with specific regions of DNA to turn off (repress) gene activity. Based on this role, the TRPS1 protein is called a transcription factor. Research suggests that the TRPS1 protein plays a role in regulating genes that control the growth of bone and cartilage, a tough but flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development.","Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type I More than 130 mutations in the TRPS1 gene have been found to cause trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type I (TRPS I). TRPS I is a condition that causes bone and joint malformations; distinctive facial features; and abnormalities of the skin, hair, teeth, sweat glands, and nails. The mutations that cause this condition affect one copy of the TRPS1 gene in each cell.Some of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) and have a ""dominant-negative"" effect, which means that the altered protein produced from one copy of the TRPS1 gene interferes with the function of the normal protein produced from the other copy of the gene. Other mutations add or delete small amounts of genetic material or alter the way the gene's instructions are used to make the protein. These changes have a ""loss-of-function"" effect and result in the production of a protein that cannot enter the cell nucleus where it is needed to bind to DNA and repress gene activity.As a result of the protein's decreased ability to repress gene activity, particularly genes that regulate bone and cartilage growth, people with TRPS1 gene mutations develop abnormal bones in the fingers and toes, joint abnormalities, distinctive facial features, and other signs and symptoms of TRPS I. "
1399,TRPV4 ,transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4,"The TRPV4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that acts as a calcium channel. This channel, which transports positively charged atoms of calcium (calcium ions) across cell membranes, is found in many types of cells and tissues. Studies suggest that the TRPV4 channel plays a role in a number of different functions in the body. These include the development of bones and cartilage, the tough but flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. It is also be involved in maintaining the body's water balance (osmoregulation) and in certain types of sensation, particularly the sensation of pain. The TRPV4 channel may also play a role in the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). It likely has additional functions that have not been identified.",Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Genetics Home Reference provides information about Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. 
1400,TSC1 ,TSC complex subunit 1,"The TSC1 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called hamartin, whose function is not fully understood. Within cells, hamartin interacts with a protein called tuberin, which is produced from the TSC2 gene. These two proteins help control cell growth and size. Proteins that normally prevent cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way are known as tumor suppressors. Hamartin and tuberin carry out their tumor suppressor function by interacting with and regulating a wide variety of other proteins.","Lymphangioleiomyomatosis Mutations in the TSC1 gene can cause a disorder called lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), although mutations in the TSC2 gene appear to be responsible for most cases of this disorder. This destructive lung disease is caused by the abnormal overgrowth of smooth muscle-like tissue in the lungs. It occurs almost exclusively in women, causing coughing, shortness of breath, chest pain, and lung collapse.LAM can occur alone (isolated or sporadic LAM) or in combination with a condition called tuberous sclerosis complex (described below). Researchers suggest that sporadic LAM can be caused by a random mutation in the TSC1 gene that occurs very early in development. As a result, some of the body's cells have a normal version of the gene, while others have the mutated version. This situation is called mosaicism. When a mutation occurs in the other copy of the TSC1 gene in certain cells during a woman's lifetime (a somatic mutation), she may develop LAM. "
1401,TSC2 ,TSC complex subunit 2,"The TSC2 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called tuberin, whose function is not fully understood. Within cells, tuberin interacts with a protein called hamartin, which is produced from the TSC1 gene. These two proteins help control cell growth and size.

1402,TSEN2 ,tRNA splicing endonuclease subunit 2,"The TSEN2 gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of an enzyme called the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex. This complex helps process several types of RNA molecules, which are chemical cousins of DNA.The tRNA splicing endonuclease complex is particularly important for the normal processing of a form of RNA known as transfer RNA (tRNA). tRNA molecules help assemble protein building blocks called amino acids into full-length proteins. However, before they can assemble proteins, tRNAs must be processed into mature molecules. In particular, regions called introns need to be removed from some tRNAs for the molecules to be functional. The tRNA splicing endonuclease complex recognizes and then removes introns to help produce mature tRNA molecules.Studies suggest that the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex may also be involved in processing another form of RNA known as messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA serves as a genetic blueprint for making proteins. Researchers suspect that the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex cuts (cleaves) one end of mRNA molecules so a string of adenines (one of the building blocks of RNA) can be added. This process is known as polyadenylation, and the string of adenines is known as a poly(A) tail. The poly(A) tail signals the stopping point for protein production and protects mRNA from being broken down before protein production occurs.","Pontocerebellar hypoplasia At least four mutations in the TSEN2 gene have been identified in people with a disorder of brain development called pontocerebellar hypoplasia. The major features of this condition include delayed development, problems with movement, and intellectual disability. TSEN2 gene mutations cause a small percentage of all cases of a form of the disorder designated pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2 (PCH2). When PCH2 results from TSEN2 gene mutations, it is sometimes categorized more specifically as PCH2B.The TSEN2 gene mutations that cause PCH2B impair the function of the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex, which likely disrupts the processing of RNA molecules and affects the production of many types of proteins. Before birth, these changes appear to have the most severe impact on fast-growing tissues, such as those in the brain. However, it is unknown exactly how reduced function of the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex leads to abnormal brain development in people with this condition. "
1403,TSEN34 ,tRNA splicing endonuclease subunit 34,"The TSEN34 gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of an enzyme called the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex. This complex helps process several types of RNA molecules, which are chemical cousins of DNA.The tRNA splicing endonuclease complex is particularly important for the normal processing of a form of RNA known as transfer RNA (tRNA). tRNA molecules help assemble protein building blocks called amino acids into full-length proteins.

The poly(A) tail signals the stopping point for protein production and protects mRNA from being broken down before protein production occurs.","Pontocerebellar hypoplasia At least one mutation in the TSEN34 gene has been identified in people with a disorder of brain development called pontocerebellar hypoplasia. The major features of this condition include delayed development, problems with movement, and intellectual disability. TSEN34 gene mutations cause a small percentage of all cases of a form of the disorder designated pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2 (PCH2). When PCH2 results from TSEN34 gene mutations, it is sometimes categorized more specifically as PCH2C.The mutation that causes PCH2C replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid tryptophan at position 58 in the TSEN34 protein (written as Arg58Trp or R58W). This mutation impairs the function of the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex, which likely disrupts the processing of RNA molecules and affects the production of many types of proteins. Before birth, these changes appear to have the most severe impact on fast-growing tissues, such as those in the brain. However, it is unknown exactly how reduced function of the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex leads to abnormal brain development in people with this condition. "
1404,TSEN54 ,tRNA splicing endonuclease subunit 54,"The TSEN54 gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of an enzyme called the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex. This complex helps process several types of RNA molecules, which are chemical cousins of DNA.The tRNA splicing endonuclease complex is particularly important for the normal processing of a form of RNA known as transfer RNA (tRNA). tRNA molecules help assemble protein building blocks called amino acids into full-length proteins.

The major features of this condition include delayed development, problems with movement, and intellectual disability. TSEN54 gene mutations are the most frequent cause of a form of the disorder designated pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2 (PCH2). When PCH2 results from TSEN54 gene mutations, it is sometimes categorized more specifically as PCH2A. Mutations in the TSEN54 gene also cause pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 4 (PCH4) and appear to be a rare cause of pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1 (PCH1).The most common mutation in the TSEN54 gene replaces the amino acid alanine with the amino acid serine at position 307 in the TSEN54 protein (written as Ala307Ser or A307S). About 90 percent of all people with PCH2 have this mutation in both copies of the TSEN54 gene in each cell. At least one person diagnosed with PCH1 also had the mutation in both copies of the gene. Most individuals with PCH4 have the common Ala307Ser mutation in one copy of the TSEN54 gene in each cell and a different mutation in the other copy of the gene.The TSEN54 gene mutations that cause pontocerebellar hypoplasia impair the function of the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex, which likely disrupts the processing of RNA molecules and affects the production of many types of proteins. Before birth, these changes appear to have the most severe impact on fast-growing tissues, such as those in the brain. However, it is unknown exactly how reduced function of the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex leads to abnormal brain development in people with pontocerebellar hypoplasia. "
1405,TSHB ,thyroid stimulating hormone beta,"The TSHB gene provides instructions for one piece (subunit) of a hormone called thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Thyroid stimulating hormone consists of two subunits called alpha and beta. The TSHB gene provides instructions for making the beta subunit. The alpha and beta subunits are bound together to produce the active form of the hormone. A particular segment of the beta subunit, known as the buckle or seatbelt, wraps around the alpha subunit to form the active hormone. This seatbelt region also helps stabilize the hormone's structure.Thyroid stimulating hormone is made in the pituitary gland, a gland at the base of the brain. This hormone plays an important role in the growth and function of the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped tissue in the lower neck. It also stimulates the production of thyroid hormones, which play a critical role in regulating growth, brain development, and the rate of chemical reactions in the body (metabolism). The pituitary gland monitors levels of thyroid hormones. When thyroid hormone levels are too low, the pituitary gland releases thyroid stimulating hormone into the bloodstream. Thyroid stimulating hormone, in turn, signals increased thyroid gland growth and production of thyroid hormones.","Congenital hypothyroidism Researchers have identified at least 10 TSHB gene mutations involved in congenital hypothyroidism, a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of thyroid hormones starting from birth. TSHB gene mutations are the primary cause of a form of the condition called central congenital hypothyroidism, which occurs when stimulation of thyroid hormone production by the pituitary gland is impaired.TSHB gene mutations involved in congenital hypothyroidism alter the size or shape of the thyroid stimulating hormone beta subunit. Many of the mutations affect the beta subunit's seatbelt region. Some mutations severely shorten the beta subunit, eliminating the seatbelt region partially or entirely. Other mutations change the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make the beta subunit. As a result, the seatbelt region cannot buckle around the alpha subunit. TSHB gene mutations prevent the production of functional thyroid stimulating hormone or its release (secretion) from the pituitary gland. As a result, thyroid hormone production is not stimulated, leading to low hormone levels that are characteristic of congenital hypothyroidism. Additionally, the thyroid gland is reduced in size (hypoplastic) because its growth is not stimulated. "
1406,TSHR ,thyroid stimulating hormone receptor,"The TSHR gene provides instructions for making a protein, known as a receptor, that attaches (binds) to a hormone called thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). This receptor spans the membrane of certain cells (called follicular cells) in the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped tissue in the lower neck. A large part of the receptor sits on the outer surface of the cell (extracellular), and a small portion is retained inside the cell (intracellular). Thyroid stimulating hormone binds to the extracellular portion of the receptor like a key fitting into a lock, activating a series of reactions that control development of the thyroid gland and its functions. Among its functions, the thyroid gland produces iodine-containing hormones (thyroid hormones), which help regulate growth, brain development, and the rate of chemical reactions in the body (metabolism).","Congenital hypothyroidism Several TSHR gene mutations have been identified in people with congenital hypothyroidism, a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of thyroid hormones starting from birth. TSHR gene mutations change one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor. Some of these mutations prevent the receptor from properly spanning the membrane, and in some cases the entire receptor is retained inside the cell. As a result, the receptor cannot interact properly with thyroid stimulating hormone. Other mutations impair the receptor's ability to bind with thyroid stimulating hormone, even though the receptor correctly spans the membrane.Without properly functioning receptors, thyroid hormone production is not stimulated. The body tries to correct the blocked stimulation by producing more thyroid stimulating hormone. In some cases, the increased levels of thyroid stimulating hormone compensate for receptors with minor defects, and the thyroid functions normally. In other cases, thyroid hormone levels remain low, causing mild to severe congenital hypothyroidism. Impaired thyroid stimulating hormone receptors may also disrupt thyroid development, and as a result, the gland is smaller than normal. Cases of congenital hypothyroidism caused by TSHR gene mutations are sometimes classified as thyroid dysgenesis because development of the thyroid gland is impaired. "
1407,TSPYL1 ,TSPY like 1,"The TSPYL1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called TSPY-like 1. This protein is active in the brain, testes (in males), and other tissues, although its function is not well understood. TSPY-like 1 contains a region called a nucleosome assembly protein (NAP) domain, which is found in other proteins that help control cell division, copy (replicate) DNA, and regulate the activity of various genes. It is unknown whether TSPY-like 1 also has these functions.Based on its role in a condition called sudden infant death with dysgenesis of the testes syndrome, researchers propose that TSPY-like 1 is involved in the development of the male reproductive system and the brain, including the brainstem. The brainstem is a part of the brain that is connected to the spinal cord. It regulates many basic body functions, including heart rate, breathing, eating, and sleeping. It also relays information about movement and the senses between the brain and the rest of the body.","Sudden infant death with dysgenesis of the testes syndrome A single mutation in the TSPYL1 gene has caused all identified cases of sudden infant death with dysgenesis of the testes syndrome (SIDDT), a condition that has been reported in an Old Order Amish community in Pennsylvania. The condition is fatal in the first year of life; its major features include abnormalities of the reproductive system in males, breathing problems, a slow or uneven heart rate, and feeding difficulties.The mutation that causes SIDDT inserts a single DNA building block (nucleotide) into the TSPYL1 gene. This mutation is written as 457_458insG. The extra nucleotide alters how the gene's instructions are used to make TSPY-like 1, which results in the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein. A loss of TSPY-like 1 function appears to disrupt the normal development of the male reproductive system and the brain, including the brainstem. Abnormalities of brainstem function, particularly involving breathing and heart rate, are likely the cause of sudden death in affected infants.Research findings suggest that mutations in the TSPYL1 gene are not associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in the general population. SIDS is a major cause of death in children younger than 1 year. "
1408,TTC37 ,tetratricopeptide repeat domain 37,"The TTC37 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function has not been confirmed. Based on its similarity to a protein in other organisms, researchers speculate that the TTC37 protein acts as part of a group of proteins called the SKI complex. This complex is thought to be necessary for the function of another large protein complex known as the cytosolic exosome. Within cells, the cytosolic exosome helps to recognize and break down excess or abnormal messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. mRNA is a chemical cousin of DNA that serves as the genetic blueprint for protein production. Studies suggest that the cytosolic exosome's role in getting rid of excess and abnormal mRNA is important for cell growth.","Trichohepatoenteric syndrome At least 25 mutations in the TTC37 gene have been found to cause trichohepatoenteric syndrome, a rare condition that affects many parts of the body. Its major signs and symptoms include chronic diarrhea starting in infancy, hair abnormalities, distinctive facial features, and liver disease. Mutations in this gene likely eliminate the function of the TTC37 protein. Researchers hypothesize that a loss of this protein's function impairs the activity of the SKI complex and the cytosolic exosome. However, it is unknown how these changes could lead to chronic diarrhea and the other features of trichohepatoenteric syndrome. "
1409,TTN ,titin,"The TTN gene provides instructions for making a very large protein called titin. This protein plays an important role in muscles the body uses for movement (skeletal muscles) and in heart (cardiac) muscle. Slightly different versions (called isoforms) of titin are made in different muscles.Within muscle cells, titin is an essential component of structures called sarcomeres. Sarcomeres are the basic units of muscle contraction; they are made of proteins that generate the mechanical force needed for muscles to contract. Titin has several functions within sarcomeres. One of the protein's main jobs is to provide structure, flexibility, and stability to these cell structures. Titin interacts with other muscle proteins, including actin and myosin, to keep the components of sarcomeres in place as muscles contract and relax. Titin also contains a spring-like region that allows muscles to stretch. Additionally, researchers have found that titin plays a role in chemical signaling and in assembling new sarcomeres.","Centronuclear myopathy At least 12 mutations in the TTN gene have been found to cause centronuclear myopathy, a condition that is characterized by muscle weakness (myopathy) in the skeletal muscles. Most of these mutations alter the way the gene's instructions are used to produce titin, resulting in production of an abnormal protein with reduced or altered activity in muscle cells. Other mutations prevent the production of titin protein. It is unclear how TTN gene mutations cause centronuclear myopathy, but it is likely that a shortage of normal titin protein leads to dysfunction of the sarcomere. Abnormal sarcomeres prevent muscle cells from contracting and relaxing normally, resulting in the muscle weakness that is characteristic of centronuclear myopathy. "
1410,TTPA ,alpha tocopherol transfer protein,"The TTPA gene provides instructions for making the α-tocopherol transfer protein (αTTP), which is found in the liver and brain. This protein controls the distribution of vitamin E obtained from the diet (also called α-tocopherol) to cells and tissues throughout the body. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that protects cells in the body from the damaging effects of unstable molecules called free radicals. Normally, vitamin E derived from food is absorbed in the intestine and then transported into the liver on molecules called chylomicrons. After a meal, chylomicrons are formed to transport fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamin E), dietary fats, and cholesterol from the intestine to the liver. Once in the liver, αTTP transfers vitamin E from chylomicrons to very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), which carry fat, fat-soluble vitamins, and cholesterol from the liver to other tissues throughout the body. The VLDLs are then released into the bloodstream so the accompanying vitamin E can be used in the body. The αTTP protein is also thought to transport vitamin E to nerve cells (neurons) in the brain.","Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency More than 20 mutations in the TTPA gene have been found to cause ataxia with vitamin E deficiency. This condition is characterized by the development of neurological problems including difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia) due to a buildup of harmful molecules called free radicals. Some of these mutations cause no functional protein to be made, while others change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the αTTP protein, reducing its function. As a result, the body cannot retain or use dietary vitamin E, which leads to reduced levels of this vitamin in the blood and the accumulation of free radicals. One TTPA gene mutation that is found in the Japanese population changes the amino acid histidine to the amino acid glutamine at position 101 in the αTTP protein (written as His101Glu or H101Q). This mutation is associated with the development of an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa that causes vision loss in people with ataxia with vitamin E deficiency.Mutations in the TTPA gene that cause no functional αTTP protein to be made are associated with a severe form of ataxia that begins at a young age. Mutations that reduce but do not eliminate the protein's function are associated with milder ataxia that occurs at a later age and progresses more slowly. "
1411,TTR ,transthyretin,"The TTR gene provides instructions for producing a protein called transthyretin. This protein transports vitamin A (retinol) and a hormone called thyroxine throughout the body. To transport thyroxine, four transthyretin proteins must be attached (bound) to each other to form a four-protein unit (tetramer). To transport retinol, transthyretin must form a tetramer and also bind to retinol binding protein. Transthyretin is produced primarily in the liver. A small amount of this protein is produced in an area of the brain called the choroid plexus and in the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (the retina).","Transthyretin amyloidosis More than 100 mutations in the TTR gene have been found to cause transthyretin amyloidosis. Nearly all of these mutations change one protein building block (amino acid) in the transthyretin protein. The most common mutation found in people with transthyretin amyloidosis replaces the amino acid valine with the amino acid methionine at position 30 in the transthyretin protein (written as Val30Met or V30M). This mutation is seen most commonly in the Portuguese and Swedish populations, although it is found in affected people worldwide. Another common mutation replaces the amino acid valine with the amino acid isoleucine at position 122 in the transthyretin protein (written as Val122Ile or V122I). It is estimated that 3 percent to 3.9 percent of African Americans and 5 percent of some West African populations have this mutation.Most of the TTR gene mutations that cause transthyretin amyloidosis are thought to alter the structure of transthyretin, impairing its ability to bind to other transthyretin proteins and altering its normal function. "
1412,TUBA1A ,tubulin alpha 1a,"The TUBA1A gene provides instructions for making a protein called alpha-tubulin (α-tubulin). This protein is part of the tubulin family of proteins that form and organize structures called microtubules. Microtubules are rigid, hollow fibers that make up the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton). They are composed of α-tubulin and a similar protein called beta-tubulin (β-tubulin) that is produced from a different gene. Microtubules are necessary for cell division and movement.Most cells produce α-tubulin, but the protein is found in highest amounts in the developing brain. During brain development, α-tubulin partners with β-tubulin to form microtubules that move nerve cells (neurons) to their proper location (neuronal migration). Microtubules form scaffolding within the cell. The tubulin proteins that make up the microtubule are moved from one end of a microtubule to the other end. This protein transfer propels the microtubules in a specific direction, moving the cell.","Isolated lissencephaly sequence Approximately 40 mutations in the TUBA1A gene have been found to cause isolated lissencephaly sequence (ILS). This condition is characterized by abnormal brain development that results in the brain having a smooth appearance (lissencephaly) instead of its normal folds and grooves. Individuals with ILS have severe neurological problems, including intellectual disability and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the α-tubulin protein. The resulting abnormal α-tubulin cannot form microtubules or interact with other proteins. As a result, the overall function of microtubules is reduced. In the developing brain, this decrease in microtubule function impairs the normal migration of neurons and leads to a decrease in the formation of the brain's folds and grooves or a completely smooth appearance of the brain, resulting in the neurological problems characteristic of ILS. "
1413,TUBB2B ,tubulin beta 2B class IIb,"The TUBB2B gene provides instructions for making one version of a protein called beta-tubulin (β-tubulin). This protein is part of the tubulin family of proteins that form and organize cell structures called microtubules. Microtubules are rigid, hollow fibers that make up the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton). They are composed of β-tubulin and a similar protein called alpha-tubulin (α-tubulin) that is produced from a different gene. Microtubules grow and shrink as tubulin proteins are added to and removed from the ends of fibers. This process allows cells to move and change shape.β-tubulin produced from the TUBB2B gene is found primarily in the brain and in nerve cells (neurons). In neurons, microtubules are integral for the cells' movement to the proper location in the brain and for a process called axon guidance, by which specialized extensions of neurons (axons) reach their correct positions. Once in the right location, axons relay messages to and from the brain to control muscle movement and detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and sound.","Congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles At least one mutation in the TUBB2B gene has been found to cause a rare form of congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles (CFEOM) called CFEOM3 with polymicrogyria. Individuals with this condition are unable to move their eyes normally; they have difficulty looking up, and they have droopy eyelids (ptosis). In addition, affected individuals have a brain malformation called polymicrogyria, in which the surface of the brain develops too many folds, and the folds are unusually small. Individuals with this form of CFEOM3 typically have intellectual disability.The TUBB2B gene mutation that causes CFEOM3 with polymicrogyria changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the β-tubulin protein. It replaces the amino acid glutamate with the amino acid lysine at protein position 421 (written as Glu421Lys or E421K). Microtubules that contain the altered β-tubulin protein do not grow and shrink as they should, which prevents axons from reaching their proper location. Nerves in the head and face (cranial nerves) that control muscles that surround the eyes (extraocular muscles) are particularly affected. Abnormal development of cranial nerves impairs the function of extraocular muscles, leading to the characteristic features of CFEOM such as restricted eye movement and droopy eyelids. It is unclear how the CFEOM-related change in the TUBB2B gene results in polymicrogyria. "
1414,TUBB3 ,tubulin beta 3 class III,"The TUBB3 gene provides instructions for making one version of a protein called beta-tubulin (β-tubulin). This protein is part of the tubulin family of proteins that form and organize cell structures called microtubules. Microtubules are rigid, hollow fibers that make up the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton). They are composed of β-tubulin and a similar protein called alpha-tubulin (α-tubulin) that is produced from a different gene. Microtubules grow and shrink as tubulin proteins are added to and removed from the ends of fibers. This process allows cells to move and change shape.β-tubulin produced from the TUBB3 gene is found in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. This β-tubulin protein plays a role in the growth of specialized nerve cell extensions called axons and dendrites (collectively called neurites). Studies show this protein is particularly important for the regrowth of neurites after injury. Neurites relay messages to and from the brain to control muscle movement and detect sensations.In addition to their role in cell movement, microtubules also function as a track along which other proteins, called motor proteins, transport materials within cells. β-tubulin produced from the TUBB3 gene appears to be important in the attachment of motor proteins to microtubules.","Congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles More than 10 mutations in the TUBB3 gene can cause congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles (CFEOM). These mutations most commonly cause a form of the condition called CFEOM3, and they are a rare cause of another form called CFEOM1. Individuals with any form of CFEOM are unable to move their eyes normally; they have difficulty looking upward or, less commonly, side-to-side, and most also have droopy eyelids (ptosis). In addition, people with CFEOM3 can have intellectual disability; behavioral, social, or language problems; or other neurological problems.The TUBB3 gene mutations that cause CFEOM change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the β-tubulin protein. The altered proteins assemble into microtubules, although some do so more readily than others. Research shows that when more altered β-tubulin protein is incorporated into microtubules, the signs and symptoms of the condition are more severe.Microtubules made with altered β-tubulin proteins do not grow and shrink as they should, which prevents neurite growth. Nerves in the head and face (cranial nerves) that control muscles that surround the eyes (extraocular muscles) are particularly affected, although other nerves can also be involved. Abnormal growth of cranial nerves impairs the function of extraocular muscles, leading to the characteristic features of CFEOM such as restricted eye movement and droopy eyelids. Researchers suspect that abnormal growth of neurites within the brain leads to brain abnormalities that underlie intellectual disability and other neurological problems in some people with CFEOM3.Certain mutations in the TUBB3 gene also appear to prevent motor proteins from attaching to microtubules. These mutations typically cause severe CFEOM3 that is associated with additional neurological problems, such as pain, weakness, or a decreased ability to feel sensations in the limbs (peripheral neuropathy) that begins in childhood or adulthood. It is unclear how these genetic changes contribute to specific signs and symptoms in severely affected individuals. "
1415,TUBB4A ,tubulin beta 4A class IVa,"The TUBB4A gene provides instructions for making a protein called beta-tubulin (β-tubulin). This protein is part of the tubulin family of proteins that form and organize structures called microtubules. Microtubules are rigid, hollow fibers that make up the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton). They are composed of β-tubulin and a similar protein called alpha-tubulin (α-tubulin) that is produced from a different gene.The β-tubulin protein produced from the TUBB4A gene is found primarily in the brain, particularly in regions called the basal ganglia (specifically a part called the putamen) and the cerebellum. These regions help control movement. The protein is also found extensively in the brain's white matter, which consists of nerve fibers covered by a fatty substance called myelin that insulates and protects them. During brain development, microtubules help move nerve cells (neurons) to their proper location (neuronal migration). The microtubules also form scaffolding within neurons that provides structure and aids in the transport of substances.","TUBB4A-related leukodystrophy More than 30 mutations in the TUBB4A gene cause TUBB4A-related leukodystrophy. This disorder is characterized by abnormalities of the white matter, particularly a reduced ability of the nervous system to produce myelin (hypomyelination). TUBB4A-related leukodystrophy has a wide range of severity, with a condition called hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (H-ABC) at the most severe end of the spectrum and isolated hypomyelination at the mildest end; the features in some affected individuals fall in between these two extremes. In addition to hypomyelination in certain brain regions, including those that help control movements, affected individuals can have breakdown (atrophy) of brain tissue in these regions, movement abnormalities, difficulty swallowing and speaking, and learning problems.The mutations that cause TUBB4A-related leukodystrophy change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the β-tubulin protein. H-ABC is most commonly caused by a mutation that replaces the amino acid aspartate with the amino acid asparagine at protein position 249 (written as Asp249Asn or D249N). This and other TUBB4A gene mutations are thought to alter the structure of the β-tubulin protein, likely impairing the formation or stability of microtubules. While it is unclear how these genetic changes lead to the signs and symptoms of TUBB4A-related leukodystrophy, researchers suspect that problems with microtubules impair neuronal migration or the transport of important substances within neurons, which may lead to dysfunction and loss of these cells in the brain, particularly in the putamen, cerebellum, and white matter. Abnormalities in these brain regions underlie the movement, speech, and learning problems that can occur in TUBB4A-related leukodystrophy. It is unclear what causes the wide range of severity in this disorder. "
1416,TWIST1 ,twist family bHLH transcription factor 1,"The TWIST1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in early development. This protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and controls the activity of particular genes. Specifically, the TWIST1 protein is part of a large protein family called basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors. Each of these proteins includes a region called the bHLH domain, which determines the protein's 3-dimensional shape and enables it to target particular sequences of DNA. The bHLH family of transcription factors helps regulate the development of many organs and tissues before birth.During embryonic development, the TWIST1 protein is essential for the formation of cells that give rise to bone, muscle, and other tissues in the head and face. The TWIST1 protein also plays a role in the early development of the limbs. Researchers believe that the TWIST1 protein regulates several genes that are known to be key players in bone formation, including the FGFR2 and RUNX2 genes.","Saethre-Chotzen syndrome More than 80 mutations in the TWIST1 gene have been identified in people with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Some of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the TWIST1 protein, while others delete or insert genetic material in the gene. In some cases, this condition is caused by chromosomal abnormalities (translocations or deletions) involving the region of chromosome 7 that contains the TWIST1 gene.TWIST1 mutations prevent one copy of the gene in each cell from producing any functional protein. A shortage of functional TWIST1 protein affects the development and maturation of cells in the skull, face, and limbs. These abnormalities underlie the signs and symptoms of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, although it is unclear exactly how a shortage of the TWIST1 protein causes specific features such as the premature fusion of certain skull bones. "
1417,TWNK ,twinkle mtDNA helicase,"The TWNK gene provides instructions for making two very similar proteins called Twinkle and Twinky. These proteins are found in the mitochondria, which are structures in which a process called oxidative phosphorylation occurs to convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use.Mitochondria each contain a small amount of DNA, known as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is essential for the normal function of these structures. The Twinkle protein is involved in the production and maintenance of mtDNA. It functions as a mitochondrial DNA helicase, which means it binds to DNA and temporarily unwinds the two spiral strands (double helix) of the DNA molecule. This unwinding is necessary for copying (replicating) mtDNA. The function of the Twinky protein is unknown.","Ataxia neuropathy spectrum Mutations in the TWNK gene have been found in a small number of people with ataxia neuropathy spectrum. This condition is characterized by problems with coordination and balance (ataxia) and disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy). The conditions previously named mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS) and sensory ataxia neuropathy dysarthria and ophthalmoplegia (SANDO) are now included in ataxia neuropathy spectrum.Mutations in the TWNK gene disrupt the function of Twinkle and lead to large deletions of mtDNA in the muscle tissue of affected individuals. However, it is unclear how mutations in the TWNK gene cause the signs and symptoms of ataxia neuropathy spectrum. "
1418,TXNL4A ,thioredoxin like 4A,"The TXNL4A gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of a protein complex called the major spliceosome, which is the larger of two types of spliceosomes found in human cells. Spliceosomes help process messenger RNA (mRNA), which is a chemical cousin of DNA that serves as a genetic blueprint for making proteins. The spliceosomes recognize and then remove regions called introns to help produce mature mRNA molecules from immature mRNA molecules.","Burn-McKeown syndrome At least 10 TXNL4A gene mutations have been identified in people with Burn-McKeown syndrome, a disorder that is present from birth (congenital) and involves abnormalities of the nasal passages, characteristic facial features, hearing loss, heart abnormalities, and short stature. Most people with Burn-McKeown syndrome have a different genetic change in each of the two copies of the TXNL4A gene in each cell; this situation is called compound heterozygosity. In one copy of the gene, a TXNL4A gene mutation results in a protein with impaired function, or no protein at all is produced. The other copy of the TXNL4A gene has a deletion of a small amount of genetic material in an area near the TXNL4A gene called the promoter region, which controls the production of protein from that gene. This genetic change reduces protein production.Research suggests that reduced quantities of the protein produced from the TXNL4A gene affect the assembly of the major spliceosome and change the production of a particular group of mRNA molecules. The details of these changes and their relationship to the specific signs and symptoms of Burn-McKeown syndrome are unknown. However, mutations in several genes involved in the spliceosome have been shown to cause other conditions with abnormalities affecting the head and face (craniofacial malformations), so craniofacial development is thought to be particularly sensitive to spliceosome problems. "
1419,TYMP ,thymidine phosphorylase,"The TYMP gene (previously known as ECGF1) provides instructions for making an enzyme called thymidine phosphorylase. Thymidine is a molecule known as a nucleoside, which (after a chemical modification) is used as a building block of DNA. Thymidine phosphorylase converts thymidine into two smaller molecules, 2-deoxyribose 1-phosphate and thymine. This chemical reaction is an important step in the breakdown of thymidine, which helps regulate the level of nucleosides in cells.Thymidine phosphorylase plays an important role in maintaining the appropriate amount of thymidine in cell structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA (called mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA). Mitochondria use nucleosides, including thymidine, to build new molecules of mtDNA as needed.","Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy disease About 50 mutations in the TYMP gene have been identified in people with mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE) disease. TYMP mutations greatly reduce or eliminate the activity of thymidine phosphorylase. A shortage of this enzyme allows thymidine to build up to very high levels in the body. An excess of thymidine appears to be damaging to mtDNA, disrupting its usual maintenance and repair. As a result, mutations can accumulate in mtDNA, causing it to become unstable. Mitochondria may also have less mtDNA than usual (mtDNA depletion). These genetic changes impair the normal function of mitochondria. Although mtDNA abnormalities underlie the digestive and neurological problems characteristic of MNGIE disease, it is unclear how defective mitochondria cause the specific features of the disorder. "
1420,TYR ,tyrosinase,"The TYR gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called tyrosinase. This enzyme is located in melanocytes, which are specialized cells that produce a pigment called melanin. Melanin is the substance that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color. Melanin is also found in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina), where it plays a role in normal vision.Tyrosinase is responsible for the first step in melanin production. It converts a protein building block (amino acid) called tyrosine to another compound called dopaquinone. A series of additional chemical reactions convert dopaquinone to melanin in the skin, hair follicles, the colored part of the eye (the iris), and the retina.","Oculocutaneous albinism More than 100 mutations in the TYR gene have been identified in people with oculocutaneous albinism type 1. These mutations disrupt the normal production of melanin, which reduces coloring of the hair, skin, and eyes and causes problems with vision. Most TYR mutations eliminate the activity of tyrosinase, preventing melanocytes from producing any melanin throughout life. These mutations cause a form of oculocutaneous albinism called type 1A (OCA1A). People with this form of albinism have white hair, light-colored eyes, and very pale skin that does not tan. Other mutations in the TYR gene reduce but do not eliminate tyrosinase activity. These mutations, which allow some melanin to be produced, cause oculocutaneous albinism type 1B (OCA1B). People with type 1B are also born with white hair, light-colored eyes, and pale skin, but hair and eye color often darken over time and skin may tan. "
1421,TYROBP ,TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein,"The TYROBP gene (also known as the DAP12 gene) provides instructions for making a protein called the TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein. This protein is found in a variety of cells produced in bone marrow (myeloid cells) and other immune system cells (lymphoid cells). The protein is located on the cell surface, where it helps transmit chemical signals that activate the cell.The TYROBP protein interacts with several other proteins on the surface of cells. For example, it forms a complex with the protein produced from the TREM2 gene. The TYROBP protein and its partners were first identified in the immune system, where they activate certain cells (such as natural killer cells and dendritic cells) that trigger an inflammatory response to injury or disease.The TYROBP-TREM2 complex also activates cells in the skeletal system and in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). In the skeletal system, the complex is found in osteoclasts, which are specialized cells that break down and remove (resorb) bone tissue that is no longer needed. These cells are involved in bone remodeling, which is a normal process that replaces old bone tissue with new bone. In the central nervous system, the complex appears to play an important role in immune cells called microglia. These cells protect the brain and spinal cord from foreign invaders and remove dead nerve cells and other debris. Although the TYROBP-TREM2 complex plays a critical role in osteoclasts and microglia, its exact function in these cells is unclear.","Polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy At least six mutations in the TYROBP gene have been identified in people with polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy (commonly known as PLOSL). One TYROBP mutation has been found to cause PLOSL in all affected people of Finnish ancestry. This mutation deletes a significant portion of the TYROBP gene, which prevents the cell from producing any protein from this gene. Mutations in other populations result in the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the protein or prevent the protein from reaching the cell surface.Researchers believe that the signs and symptoms of PLOSL are related to defective TYROBP-TREM2 signaling in osteoclasts and microglia. The bone abnormalities seen with this disorder are probably related to malfunctioning osteoclasts, which are less able to resorb bone tissue during bone remodeling. In the central nervous system, defective signaling through the TYROBP-TREM2 complex causes widespread abnormalities of microglia. Researchers are working to determine how these abnormalities lead to the neurological problems associated with PLOSL. "
1422,TYRP1 ,tyrosinase related protein 1,"The TYRP1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called tyrosinase-related protein 1. This enzyme is located in melanocytes, which are specialized cells that produce a pigment called melanin. Melanin is the substance that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color. Melanin is also found in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina), where it plays a role in normal vision.Tyrosinase-related protein 1 is involved in the production of melanin, although its exact functions are unclear. Studies suggest that this enzyme may help stabilize tyrosinase, which is the enzyme responsible for the first step in melanin production. Tyrosinase-related protein 1 may also help determine the shape of melanosomes, which are the structures in melanocytes where melanin is produced.","Oculocutaneous albinism A small number of mutations in the TYRP1 gene have been found to cause oculocutaneous albinism type 3. This condition includes a form of albinism called rufous oculocutaneous albinism, which has been described primarily in dark-skinned people from southern Africa. Affected individuals have reddish-brown skin, ginger or red hair, and hazel or brown irises. Two TYRP1 mutations are known to cause this form of albinism in individuals from Africa. One mutation replaces a protein building block (amino acid) in tyrosine-related protein 1 with a signal that prematurely stops protein production. This mutation, written as Ser166Ter or S166X, affects the amino acid serine at protein position 166. The other mutation, written as 368delA, deletes a single DNA building block from the TYRP1 gene. Other alterations in this gene have been reported in a few affected people of non-African heritage. Most TYRP1 mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of tyrosinase-related protein 1. Because this enzyme plays a role in normal pigmentation, its loss leads to the changes in skin, hair, and eye coloration that are characteristic of oculocutaneous albinism. "
1423,UBA1 ,ubiquitin like modifier activating enzyme 1,"The UBA1 gene provides instructions for making the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1. This enzyme is necessary for the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which targets damaged or unneeded proteins to be broken down (degraded) within cells. Protein degradation helps to maintain the proper balance of protein production and breakdown (protein homeostasis). Old proteins need to be removed to make way for new proteins to allow cells to function and survive. The ubiquitin-proteasome system acts as the cell's quality control system by disposing of damaged, misshapen, and excess proteins.Ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 is responsible for the first step in the ubiquitin-proteasome system; it turns on (activates) a small protein called ubiquitin. With the assistance of other proteins, the active ubiquitin attaches to a protein that is to be broken down. When a chain of ubiquitin proteins is attached to a protein, the protein is recognized and destroyed by a complex of enzymes called a proteasome.","X-linked infantile spinal muscular atrophy At least four mutations in the UBA1 gene have been found to cause X-linked infantile spinal muscular atrophy. This condition is characterized by severe muscle weakness that begins at birth or in early infancy and affects only boys. Weakness in the chest muscles that control breathing often causes death from respiratory failure in early childhood.Each of the UBA1 gene mutations that causes X-linked infantile spinal muscular atrophy changes one DNA building block (nucleotide) in an area of the gene known as exon 15. These mutations reduce the activity, function, or production of the enzyme. This shortage of functional enzyme allows damaged or unneeded proteins to build up inside cells instead of being degraded, which may damage cells and contribute to cell death. This buildup also disrupts protein homeostasis. If damaged or unneeded proteins are not degraded, they can impair normal cell functions by stopping the production of new proteins. An imbalance in protein production and breakdown can ultimately lead to cell death. Specialized nerve cells that control muscle movement (motor neurons) are particularly susceptible to disruptions in cell function, likely due to their large size. Loss of these cells causes many of the signs and symptoms of X-linked infantile spinal muscular atrophy. "
1424,UBE3A ,ubiquitin protein ligase E3A,"The UBE3A gene provides instructions for making a protein called ubiquitin protein ligase E3A. Ubiquitin protein ligases are enzymes that target other proteins to be broken down (degraded) within cells. These enzymes attach a small molecule called ubiquitin to proteins that should be degraded. Cellular structures called proteasomes recognize and digest these ubiquitin-tagged proteins. Protein degradation is a normal process that removes damaged or unnecessary proteins and helps maintain the normal functions of cells.Studies suggest that ubiquitin protein ligase E3A plays a critical role in the normal development and function of the nervous system. Studies suggest that it helps control (regulate) the balance of protein synthesis and degradation (proteostasis) at the junctions between nerve cells (synapses) where cell-to-cell communication takes place. Regulation of proteostasis is important for the synapses to change and adapt over time in response to experience, a characteristic called synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity is critical for learning and memory.People normally inherit two copies of the UBE3A gene, one from each parent. Both copies of the gene are turned on (active) in most of the body's tissues. In certain areas of the brain, however, only the copy inherited from a person's mother (the maternal copy) is active. This parent-specific gene activation results from a phenomenon known as genomic imprinting.","Angelman syndrome A loss of UBE3A gene function in the brain likely causes many of the characteristic features of Angelman syndrome, a complex genetic disorder that primarily affects the nervous system. This loss of function results from a chromosomal change or gene mutation that affects the maternal copy of the gene.Several different genetic mechanisms can turn off (inactivate) or delete the UBE3A gene. Most cases of Angelman syndrome (about 70 percent) occur when a segment of the maternal chromosome 15 containing this gene is deleted. In another 11 percent of cases, Angelman syndrome results from mutations within the UBE3A gene itself. Most of these mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of ubiquitin protein ligase E3A. Because the copy of the gene inherited from a person's father (the paternal copy) is normally inactive in some areas of the brain, loss of the maternal copy prevents any of the enzyme from being produced in these brain regions. This lack of enzyme function likely causes the major signs and symptoms of Angelman syndrome.Other abnormalities involving the region of chromosome 15 that contains the UBE3A gene can also cause Angelman syndrome. These chromosomal changes include rearrangements (translocations) of genetic material or a defect in the region of DNA that controls activation of the UBE3A gene. Like mutations within the gene, these chromosomal changes prevent any functional ubiquitin protein ligase E3A from being produced in certain parts of the brain. "
1425,UBE3B ,ubiquitin protein ligase E3B,"The UBE3B gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unwanted proteins.The UBE3B protein is called an E3 ubiquitin ligase. E3 ubiquitin ligases function as part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system by forming part of a protein complex that tags damaged and excess proteins with molecules called ubiquitin. Ubiquitin serves as a signal to specialized cell structures known as proteasomes, which attach (bind) to the tagged proteins and degrade them. The ubiquitin-proteasome system acts as the cell's quality control system by disposing of damaged, misshapen, and excess proteins. This system also regulates the level of proteins involved in several critical cell activities such as the timing of cell division and growth. The specific proteins tagged by complexes involving the UBE3B protein are unknown, but research suggests that the protein functions in the nervous system, digestive tract, respiratory system, and other organs and tissues, from before birth into adulthood.","Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome At least 15 UBE3B gene mutations have been identified in people with Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome, which is a disorder characterized by eye problems (oculo-), severe intellectual disability (-cerebro-), and a distinctive pattern of facial features (-facial). The mutations associated with this disorder are thought to result in an abnormal UBE3B protein that cannot function properly or that is unstable and is rapidly broken down. Loss of this protein's function likely prevents cells from eliminating certain unnecessary proteins, resulting in problems with development and function of the nervous system and other parts of the body. "
1426,UCHL1 ,ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1,"The UCHL1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1. This enzyme is found in nerve cells throughout the brain. Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 is probably involved in the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unneeded proteins. In cells, damaged or excess proteins are tagged with molecules called ubiquitin. Ubiquitin serves as a signal to move these unneeded proteins into specialized structures known as proteasomes, where the proteins are degraded. The ubiquitin-proteasome system acts as the cell's quality control system by disposing of damaged, misshapen, and excess proteins.Although the exact function of ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 is not fully understood, it appears to have two types of enzyme activity. One of these, called hydrolase activity, removes and recycles ubiquitin molecules from degraded proteins. This recycling step is important to sustain the degradation process. The other enzyme function, known as ligase activity, links together ubiquitin molecules for use in tagging proteins for disposal.","Parkinson disease A relatively common variation (polymorphism) in the UCHL1 gene may reduce the risk of developing Parkinson disease, a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement and balance. The variation leads to a change in one of the building blocks (amino acids) used to make ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1. Instead of serine at position 18 in the enzyme's chain of amino acids, people with the polymorphism have the amino acid tyrosine (written as Ser18Tyr or S18Y). This change is most common in Chinese and Japanese populations and occurs less frequently in European populations. The polymorphism reduces the ligase activity of ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 but has little effect on the hydrolase activity. Some studies suggest that having the S18Y polymorphism may help protect against Parkinson disease, particularly in young adults. However, other studies have not shown this effect. It remains unclear how this amino acid variation might reduce the risk of developing Parkinson disease.A different change in the UCHL1 gene may increase the risk of Parkinson disease. This mutation has been reported in two siblings with the disease. The mutation replaces the amino acid isoleucine with the amino acid methionine at position 93 in ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 (written as Ile93Met or I93M). The mutation leads to decreased hydrolase activity, which may disrupt the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Instead of being degraded, unneeded proteins could accumulate to toxic levels that impair or kill nerve cells in the brain. The loss of these cells weakens communication between the brain and muscles, and ultimately the brain becomes unable to control muscle movement. It is unclear whether this UCHL1 gene mutation is a true risk factor for Parkinson disease, because it has been identified in only one family. "
1427,UGT1A1 ,UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1,"The UGT1A1 gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making enzymes called UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. These enzymes perform a chemical reaction called glucuronidation, in which a compound called glucuronic acid is attached (conjugated) to one of a number of different substances.The protein produced from the UGT1A1 gene, called the bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (bilirubin-UGT) enzyme, is the only enzyme that glucuronidates bilirubin, a substance produced when red blood cells are broken down. This enzyme converts the toxic form of bilirubin (unconjugated bilirubin) to its nontoxic form (conjugated bilirubin), making it able to be dissolved and removed from the body.The bilirubin-UGT enzyme is primarily found in cells of the liver, where bilirubin glucuronidation takes place. Conjugated bilirubin is dissolved in bile, a fluid produced in the liver, and excreted with solid waste.","Crigler-Najjar syndrome At least 85 mutations in the UGT1A1 gene that cause Crigler-Najjar syndrome have been identified. This condition occurs when both copies of the UGT1A1 gene in each cell are altered. Crigler-Najjar syndrome is characterized by high levels of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood (unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia) and yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice). Some affected individuals develop a form of brain damage called kernicterus due to the accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in the brain, which can be lethal.Mutations in the UGT1A1 gene that cause Crigler-Najjar syndrome result in reduced or absent function of the bilirubin-UGT enzyme. People with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1 (CN1) have no enzyme function, while people with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 2 (CN2) have less than 20 percent of normal function. The signs and symptoms of CN1 are more severe than those of CN2. The loss of bilirubin-UGT function decreases glucuronidation of unconjugated bilirubin. This toxic substance then builds up in the body, causing hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice, and sometimes, kernicterus. "
1428,UMOD ,uromodulin,"The UMOD gene provides instructions for making a protein called uromodulin. This protein is produced by the kidneys and then excreted from the body in urine. The function of uromodulin remains unclear, although it is known to be the most abundant protein in the urine of healthy individuals. Researchers have suggested that uromodulin may protect against urinary tract infections. It may also help control the amount of water in urine.","Uromodulin-associated kidney disease More than 40 mutations in the UMOD gene have been found to cause uromodulin-associated kidney disease. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make uromodulin. These mutations alter the structure of the protein, preventing its release from kidney cells. Abnormal buildup of uromodulin may trigger the self-destruction (apoptosis) of cells in the kidneys, causing kidney disease. "
1429,UNC13D ,unc-13 homolog D,"The UNC13D gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the process of cell destruction (cytolysis) and the regulation of the immune system.The UNC13D protein is involved in the release of substances from cells (exocytosis). In particular, it is important for the exocytosis of structures called cytolytic granules from immune cells called T cells and NK cells. T cells and NK cells destroy other cells by secreting these cytolytic granules, which contain cell-killing proteins, onto the membranes of the target cells. The UNC13D protein helps transport these granules to the membrane of the target cell, allowing cytolytic proteins to enter the cell and trigger it to self-destruct.This cytolytic mechanism also helps regulate the immune system by destroying unneeded T cells. Controlling the number of T cells prevents the overproduction of immune proteins called cytokines that lead to inflammation and which, in excess, cause tissue damage.","Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis More than 50 UNC13D gene mutations have been identified in people with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Most of these mutations alter the way the gene's instructions are pieced together to produce the UNC13D protein, leading to a dysfunctional protein. The resulting shortage of functional UNC13D protein interferes with its role in cell destruction and immune system regulation, leading to the exaggerated immune response characteristic of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. "
1430,UNC80 ,"unc-80 homolog, NALCN channel complex subunit","The UNC80 gene provides instructions for making a large protein that is important in the functioning of a sodium channel called NALCN. Sodium channels transport positively charged sodium atoms (sodium ions) into cells and play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. The UNC80 protein forms a bridge between NALCN and another protein called UNC79; along with several other molecules, these proteins group together to form a functional NALCN channel complex (channelosome). UNC80 also helps locate and stabilize the NALCN channelosome in the cell membrane of nerve cells (neurons). The channelosome helps regulate the activity level (excitability) of these cells.","UNC80 deficiency At least 10 UNC80 gene mutations have been identified in people with UNC80 deficiency, a disorder that causes severe nervous system and developmental problems that are apparent from birth or early infancy. The mutations that occur in people with this disorder result in absence of the UNC80 protein or production of an abnormal protein. Absence of functional UNC80 protein impairs the stability and function of the NALCN channelosome. Neuron excitability is thought to be improperly regulated as a result, but it is unclear how these changes cause the specific features of UNC80 deficiency. "
1431,UPB1 ,beta-ureidopropionase 1,"The UPB1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called beta-ureidopropionase. This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of molecules called pyrimidines, which are building blocks of DNA and its chemical cousin RNA.The beta-ureidopropionase enzyme is involved in the last step of the process that breaks down pyrimidines. This step converts N-carbamyl-beta-aminoisobutyric acid to beta-aminoisobutyric acid and also breaks down N-carbamyl-beta-alanine to beta-alanine, ammonia, and carbon dioxide. Both beta-aminoisobutyric acid and beta-alanine are thought to play roles in the nervous system. Beta-aminoisobutyric acid increases the production of a protein called leptin, which has been found to help protect brain cells from damage caused by toxins, inflammation, and other factors. Research suggests that beta-alanine is involved in sending signals between nerve cells (synaptic transmission) and in controlling the level of a chemical messenger (neurotransmitter) called dopamine.","Beta-ureidopropionase deficiency At least 16 UPB1 gene mutations have been identified in people with beta-ureidopropionase deficiency. This disorder causes excessive amounts of N-carbamyl-beta-aminoisobutyric acid and N-carbamyl-beta-alanine to be released in the urine. Affected individuals may also have a variety of neurological problems such as seizures and intellectual disability, ranging from mild to severe. Some people with beta-ureidopropionase deficiency have no neurological symptoms, and the disorder can only be diagnosed with laboratory testing.The mutations that cause beta-ureidopropionase deficiency reduce or eliminate beta-ureidopropionase enzyme activity. Loss of this enzyme function reduces the production of beta-aminoisobutyric acid and beta-alanine, and leads to an excess of their precursor molecules, N-carbamyl-beta-aminoisobutyric acid and N-carbamyl-beta-alanine, which are released in the urine. Reduced production of beta-aminoisobutyric acid and beta-alanine may impair their functions in the nervous system, leading to neurological problems in some people with beta-ureidopropionase deficiency. The extent of the reduction in enzyme activity caused by a particular UPB1 gene mutation, along with other genetic and environmental factors, may determine whether people with beta-ureidopropionase deficiency develop neurological problems and the severity of these problems. "
1432,UROD ,uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase,"The UROD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme known as uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. This enzyme is involved in the production of a molecule called heme. Heme is vital for all of the body's organs, although it is most abundant in the blood, bone marrow, and liver. Heme is an essential component of iron-containing proteins called hemoproteins, including hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in the blood).The production of heme is a multi-step process that requires eight different enzymes. Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase is responsible for the fifth step in this process, in which carbon and oxygen atoms are removed from uroporphyrinogen III (the product of the fourth step) to form coproporphyrinogen III. In subsequent steps, three other enzymes produce and modify compounds that ultimately lead to heme.","Porphyria Mutations in the UROD gene is responsible for two forms of porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria. Porphyria cutanea tarda is the most common type of porphyria; its signs and symptoms tend to be milder and appear later in life than those of hepatoerythropoietic porphyria. When a mutation occurs in one copy of the UROD gene in each cell, it increases the risk of developing porphyria cutanea tarda. (Multiple genetic and nongenetic factors contribute to this form of porphyria.) Mutations in both copies of the UROD gene in each cell cause hepatoerythropoietic porphyria.More than 50 UROD gene mutations have been associated with porphyria cutanea tarda. These mutations reduce the activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase by approximately 50 percent throughout the body. As a result, compounds called porphyrins build up to toxic levels in organs and tissues, starting in the liver. This buildup, in combination with nongenetic factors such as alcohol use, smoking, certain hormones, excess iron, and hepatitis C or HIV infections, leads to this type of porphyria.At least 10 mutations in the UROD gene have been identified in people with hepatoerythropoietic porphyria. A few of these mutations have also been associated with porphyria cutanea tarda. Mutations that cause hepatoerythropoietic porphyria reduce the activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase to less than 10 percent of normal. A shortage of this enzyme allows compounds called porphyrins to build up in the body. These compounds are formed during the normal process of heme production, but reduced activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase allows them to accumulate to toxic levels. This abnormal buildup of porphyrins leads to the characteristic features of this type of porphyria. "
1433,UROS ,uroporphyrinogen III synthase,"The UROS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme known as uroporphyrinogen III synthase. This enzyme is involved in the production of a molecule called heme. Heme is vital for all of the body's organs, although it is most abundant in the blood, bone marrow, and liver. Heme is an essential component of iron-containing proteins called hemoproteins, including hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in the blood).The production of heme is a multi-step process that requires eight different enzymes. Uroporphyrinogen III synthase is responsible for the fourth step in this process, in which hydroxymethylbilane (the product of the third step) is rearranged to form uroporphyrinogen III. In subsequent steps, four other enzymes produce and modify compounds that ultimately lead to heme.","Porphyria More than 35 mutations in the UROS gene have been found to cause a form of porphyria known as congenital erythropoietic porphyria. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in uroporphyrinogen III synthase. The most common UROS gene mutation, which is found in about one-third of all cases of congenital erythropoietic porphyria, replaces the amino acid cysteine with the amino acid arginine at position 73 (written as Cys73Arg or C73R). Several other mutations occur in a nearby region of DNA that regulates the activity of the UROS gene.Mutations in or near the UROS gene alter the structure and function of uroporphyrinogen III synthase, which reduces the enzyme's activity. A shortage of functional uroporphyrinogen III synthase allows compounds called porphyrins to build up in developing red blood cells. These compounds are formed during the normal process of heme production, but reduced activity of uroporphyrinogen III synthase allows them to accumulate to toxic levels. The excess porphyrins can leak out of developing red blood cells and be transported through the bloodstream to the skin and other tissues. An accumulation of these substances in the skin causes oversensitivity to sunlight and the other characteristic features of congenital erythropoietic porphyria. "
1434,USB1 ,U6 snRNA biogenesis phosphodiesterase 1,"The USB1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that functions as an RNA exonuclease. RNA exonucleases cut off (cleave) building blocks called nucleotides one at a time from molecules of RNA (a chemical cousin of DNA). This process helps stabilize the RNA and protects it from damage.Specifically, the USB1 enzyme protects a small RNA molecule called U6, which is an essential component of a complex called a spliceosome. The USB1 enzyme also helps transport (chaperones) U6 to the spliceosome and helps it attach (bind) to the proteins in the complex. Spliceosomes process RNA molecules called messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by recognizing and removing regions known as introns and splicing the mRNA molecules back together to provide the blueprint for making proteins.Different versions (isoforms) of the USB1 enzyme are produced in different tissues, where they play various roles. In blood-forming tissues, the USB1 enzyme is thought to be important for the maturation of neutrophils. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell involved in the immune system. In the skin, the USB1 enzyme is found in pigment-producing cells (melanocytes), cells in the outer layer of the skin called keratinocytes, and structural cells called fibroblasts. Its role in the function of these cells is unknown.","Poikiloderma with neutropenia At least 24 mutations in the USB1 gene have been identified in people with poikiloderma with neutropenia (PN). This condition involves a group of skin abnormalities called poikiloderma and a persistent shortage (deficiency) of neutrophils (chronic neutropenia).The USB1 gene mutations that cause PN are thought to lead to an enzyme whose function is impaired. As a result of the dysfunctional USB1 exonuclease, the U6 RNA is not protected from damage and not correctly chaperoned to the spliceosomes, leading to impairment of key biological functions. The specific connection between USB1 gene mutations and the signs and symptoms of PN is unknown. However, the existence of tissue-specific isoforms of the enzyme could help explain why this disorder mainly affects the skin and immune system. "
1435,USH2A ,usherin,"The USH2A gene provides instructions for making a protein called usherin. Usherin is an important component of basement membranes, which are thin, sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues. Usherin is found in basement membranes in the inner ear and in the retina, which is the layer of light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. Although the function of usherin has not been well established, studies suggest that it is part of a group of proteins (a protein complex) that plays an important role in the development and maintenance of cells in the inner ear and retina. The protein complex may also be involved in the function of synapses, which are junctions between nerve cells where cell-to-cell communication occurs.","Retinitis pigmentosa Several dozen mutations in the USH2A gene have been reported to cause retinitis pigmentosa, a vision disorder that causes the light-sensing cells of the retina to gradually deteriorate. USH2A gene mutations are the most common cause of the autosomal recessive form of retinitis pigmentosa, accounting for 10 to 15 percent of all cases. This form of the disorder is described as nonsyndromic, which means that it is not associated with other signs and symptoms as part of a genetic syndrome (such as Usher syndrome, described below).The USH2A gene mutations that cause retinitis pigmentosa change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the usherin protein. Through a mechanism that is not well understood, these genetic changes lead to the gradual breakdown of specialized light receptor cells called photoreceptors in the retina. A loss of these cells underlies the progressive vision loss characteristic of this condition. "
1436,UTP4 ,"UTP4, small subunit processome component","The UTP4 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cirhin, whose precise function is unknown. This protein is found in many different tissues and organs. Within cells, cirhin is located in a structure called the nucleolus, which is a small region inside the nucleus where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is produced. A chemical cousin of DNA, rRNA is a molecule that helps assemble protein building blocks (amino acids) into functioning proteins. Researchers believe that cirhin may play a role in processing rRNA.Studies also suggest that cirhin interacts with other proteins, and it may function as part of a protein complex (a group of proteins that work together). The significance of these protein interactions is unknown.","North American Indian childhood cirrhosis At least one mutation in the UTP4 gene has been found to cause North American Indian childhood cirrhosis, a chronic liver disease identified in a Native American population in Quebec. The known mutation replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid tryptophan at protein position 565 (written as Arg565Trp or R565W). This genetic change likely alters the structure and function of cirhin. However, it is unclear why the effects of the UTP4 gene mutation are limited to the liver or how they cause the progressive liver damage characteristic of this disorder. "
1437,UVSSA ,UV stimulated scaffold protein A,"The UVSSA gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in repairing DNA damaged by ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun. The damage can block vital cell activities such as gene transcription, which is the first step in protein production. If left uncorrected, DNA damage accumulates, which causes cells to malfunction and can lead to cell death.Cells have several mechanisms to correct DNA damage. The UVSSA protein is involved in one mechanism that repairs damaged DNA within active genes (those genes undergoing gene transcription). When DNA in active genes is damaged, the enzyme that carries out gene transcription (RNA polymerase) gets stuck, and the process stalls. Researchers think that the UVSSA protein helps remove RNA polymerase from the damaged site, so the DNA can be repaired. Part of the UVSSA protein's role in this process is to ensure that another important protein called CSB is not broken down by exposure to UV rays.","UV-sensitive syndrome Mutations in the UVSSA gene cause UV-sensitive syndrome, which is a disorder characterized by sun sensitivity. People with this condition sunburn easily and have freckled skin or other changes in skin coloring (pigmentation). At least three UVSSA gene mutations have been identified, and these mutations eliminate the production of the UVSSA protein. Without this protein, skin cells cannot repair DNA damage caused by UV rays, and transcription of damaged genes is blocked. However, it is unclear exactly how a loss of the UVSSA protein causes the signs and symptoms of UV-sensitive syndrome. "
1438,VCAN ,versican,"The VCAN gene provides instructions for making a protein called versican. Versican is a type of protein known as a proteoglycan, which means it has several sugar molecules attached to it. Versican is found in the extracellular matrix of many different tissues and organs. The extracellular matrix is the intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. Versican interacts with many proteins and molecules to facilitate the assembly of the extracellular matrix and ensure its stability. Within the eye, versican interacts with other proteins to maintain the structure and gel-like consistency of the thick clear fluid that fills the eyeball (the vitreous).Researchers have proposed several additional functions for versican. This protein likely helps regulate cell growth and division, the attachment of cells to one another (cell adhesion), and cell movement (migration). Studies suggest that versican plays a role in forming new blood vessels (angiogenesis), wound healing, inflammation, and preventing the growth of cancerous tumors. Versican also regulates the activity of several growth factors, which control a diverse range of processes important for cell growth.Four different versions (isoforms) of the versican protein are produced from the VCAN gene. These isoforms (called V0, V1, V2, and V3) vary by size and by their location within the body.","Wagner syndrome At least 11 mutations in the VCAN gene have been found to cause Wagner syndrome, a condition that leads to progressive vision loss starting in childhood or early adulthood. The VCAN gene mutations that cause Wagner syndrome disrupt the way the gene's instructions are used to make versican. These mutations occur in two areas of the gene called intron 7 and exon 8; mutations in these regions lead to a decrease in the production of versican isoforms V0 and V1 and an increase in the production of isoforms V2 and V3. Researchers believe that this imbalance of versican isoforms in the vitreous impairs versican's interaction with other proteins, causing the vitreous to become unstable. This lack of stability in the vitreous affects other areas of the eye and contributes to the vision problems that occur in people with Wagner syndrome. It is unknown why VCAN gene mutations seem solely to affect vision. "
1439,VCP ,valosin containing protein,"The VCP gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called valosin-containing protein. This enzyme is found throughout the body and has a wide variety of functions within cells. It is involved in cell division, joining (fusing) membranes within cells, reassembling cell structures after cells have divided, preventing the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis), and repairing damaged DNA.Valosin-containing protein is part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is the machinery that breaks down (degrades) unneeded proteins within cells. This system provides quality control by disposing of damaged, misshapen, and excess proteins. It also regulates the level of proteins involved in several critical cell activities, such as the timing of cell division and growth. Researchers believe that most of the functions of valosin-containing protein are directly or indirectly related to the ubiquitin-proteasome system.","Inclusion body myopathy with early-onset Paget disease and frontotemporal dementia More than 30 mutations in the VCP gene have been identified in people who have inclusion body myopathy with early-onset Paget disease and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD). This rare disease causes muscle weakness (myopathy) and can also include a painful bone condition called Paget disease of bone and a brain condition called frontotemporal dementia that worsens over time.The mutations associated with IBMPFD each change a single protein building block (amino acid) in valosin-containing protein. Changes in the structure of this enzyme impair its ability to break down other proteins as part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. As a result, excess and abnormal proteins build up in muscle, bone, and brain cells. The proteins form clumps (aggregates) that interfere with the normal functions of these cells. It remains unclear how damage to muscle, bone, and brain cells leads to the specific features of IBMPFD. "
1440,VDR ,vitamin D receptor,"The VDR gene provides instructions for making a protein called vitamin D receptor (VDR), which allows the body to respond to vitamin D. This vitamin can be acquired from foods in the diet or made in the body with help from sunlight exposure. Vitamin D is involved in maintaining the proper balance of several minerals in the body, including calcium and phosphate, which are essential for the normal formation of bones and teeth. One of vitamin D's major roles is to control the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the intestines into the bloodstream. Vitamin D is also involved in several processes unrelated to bone and tooth formation.The VDR protein attaches (binds) to the active form of vitamin D, known as calcitriol. This interaction allows VDR to partner with another protein called retinoid X receptor (RXR). The resulting complex then binds to particular regions of DNA, known as vitamin D response elements, and regulates the activity of vitamin D-responsive genes. By turning these genes on or off, the complex helps control calcium and phosphate absorption and other processes.Although the mechanism is not completely understood, the VDR protein is also involved in hair growth. Studies suggest that this process does not require calcitriol binding.","Vitamin D-dependent rickets Mutations in the VDR gene cause vitamin D-dependent rickets type 2A (VDDR2A), also known as hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets (HVDRR). This disorder of bone development is characterized by low levels of calcium (hypocalcemia) and phosphate (hypophosphatemia) in the blood, which lead to soft, weak bones (rickets) that are prone to fracture. A common feature of this condition is abnormally curved (bowed) legs.The VDR gene mutations that cause this condition prevent the VDR protein from functioning properly. Some changes in the VDR gene lead to an abnormally short version of the VDR protein. Others result in the production of an abnormal receptor that cannot bind to calcitriol, to RXR, or to DNA. Although there is plenty of calcitriol in the body, the altered VDR protein cannot stimulate gene activity important for mineral absorption. The lack of calcium and phosphate absorption in the intestines slows deposition of these minerals into developing bone (bone mineralization), which leads to soft, weak bones and other features of VDDR2A. Hypocalcemia also causes muscle weakness and seizures in some affected individuals. Most VDR gene mutations impair hair growth, leading to hair loss (alopecia); however, mutations that block VDR's ability to interact with calcitriol do not cause alopecia, indicating that calcitriol is not necessary for the receptor's role in hair development. "
1441,VHL ,von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor,"The VHL gene provides instructions for making a protein that functions as part of a complex (a group of proteins that work together) called the VCB-CUL2 complex. This complex targets other proteins to be broken down (degraded) by the cell when they are no longer needed. Protein degradation is a normal process that removes damaged or unnecessary proteins and helps maintain the normal functions of cells.One of the targets of the VCB-CUL2 complex is a protein called hypoxia-inducible factor 2-alpha (HIF-2α). HIF-2α is one part (subunit) of a larger protein complex called HIF, which plays a critical role in the body's ability to adapt to changing oxygen levels. HIF controls several genes involved in cell division, the formation of new blood vessels, and the production of red blood cells. It is the major regulator of a hormone called erythropoietin, which controls red blood cell production. HIF's function is particularly important when oxygen levels are lower than normal (hypoxia). However, when adequate oxygen is available, the VCB-CUL2 complex keeps HIF from building up inappropriately in cells.The VHL protein likely plays a role in other cellular functions, including the regulation of other genes and control of cell division. Based on this function, the VHL protein is classified as a tumor suppressor, which means it prevents cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. The VHL protein is also involved in the formation of the extracellular matrix, which is an intricate lattice that forms in the spaces between cells and provides structural support to tissues.","Familial erythrocytosis At least 10 inherited mutations in the VHL gene have been found to cause familial erythrocytosis, a condition characterized by an increased number of red blood cells and an elevated risk of abnormal blood clots. When familial erythrocytosis results from VHL gene mutations, it is often designated ECYT2.The first VHL gene mutation related to familial erythrocytosis was identified in the Chuvash population of Russia. (It has since been found in other geographic regions as well.) The mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the VHL protein, replacing the amino acid arginine with the amino acid tryptophan at position 200 (written as Arg200Trp or R200W). This mutation disrupts the function of the VHL protein, particularly its ability to target HIF-2α to be broken down. As a result, HIF accumulates in cells even when adequate oxygen is available. The presence of extra HIF leads to the production of red blood cells when no more are needed, which leads to an excess of these cells in the bloodstream.The other VHL gene mutations that can cause familial erythrocytosis also change single amino acids in the VHL protein. These genetic changes are thought to have similar effects on protein function to those of the Arg200Trp mutation. These mutations have been identified in the Chuvash population and in other regions worldwide. "
1442,VKORC1 ,vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1,"The VKORC1 gene provides instructions for making a vitamin K epoxide reductase enzyme. The VKORC1 enzyme is made primarily in the liver. It spans the membrane of a cellular structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved with protein processing and transport. The VKORC1 enzyme helps turn on (activate) clotting proteins in the pathway that forms blood clots. Specifically, the VKORC1 enzyme converts one form of vitamin K into a different form of vitamin K that assists in activating clotting proteins.","Warfarin resistance Multiple variations (polymorphisms) in the VKORC1 gene have been associated with warfarin resistance, a condition in which individuals require higher doses of the drug warfarin than are usually prescribed. Warfarin is an anticoagulant, which means that it thins the blood and prevents blood clots from forming. It acts by attaching (binding) to the VKORC1 enzyme and blocking (inhibiting) the activation of the clotting proteins.The most common VKORC1 gene polymorphism in people with warfarin resistance changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the VKORC1 enzyme. Specifically, the amino acid aspartic acid is replaced with the amino acid tyrosine at position 36 (written as Asp36Tyr or D36Y). This polymorphism leads to the formation of a VKORC1 enzyme with a decreased ability to bind to warfarin. As a result, a higher dose of warfarin is needed to inhibit the VKORC1 enzyme and stop the clotting process. If people with warfarin resistance require anticoagulant treatment and take the average warfarin dose (or less), they will remain at risk of developing a potentially harmful blood clot. "
1443,VLDLR ,very low density lipoprotein receptor,"The VLDLR gene provides instructions for making a protein called a very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor. This protein is active in many different organs and tissues, including the heart, muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles), fatty (adipose) tissue, and the kidneys. The VLDL receptor appears to play a particularly important role in the developing brain.The VLDL receptor works together with a protein called reelin. Reelin fits into the VLDL receptor like a key in a lock, which triggers a series of chemical reactions within the cell. During early brain development, the reelin signaling pathway helps to guide the movement of immature nerve cells (neuroblasts) to their appropriate locations in the brain.","VLDLR-associated cerebellar hypoplasia At least six mutations in the VLDLR gene have been found to cause VLDLR-associated cerebellar hypoplasia. These mutations prevent cells from producing any functional VLDL receptor protein. Without this protein, neuroblasts cannot reach the parts of the brain where they are needed. These problems with brain development predominantly affect the cerebellum, which is the part of the brain that coordinates movement. People with VLDLR-associated cerebellar hypoplasia have an unusually small and underdeveloped cerebellum, which leads to problems with balance and coordination (ataxia) and impaired speech. Other regions of the brain are also affected, resulting in intellectual disability and the other major features of this condition. "
1444,VPS13A ,vacuolar protein sorting 13 homolog A,The VPS13A gene provides instructions for producing a protein called chorein. Chorein is found in various tissues throughout the body. The function of this protein is unknown. Some researchers believe that chorein plays a role in the movement of proteins within cells.,"Chorea-acanthocytosis Approximately 75 mutations in the VPS13A gene have been found to cause chorea-acanthocytosis. Most of these mutations insert or delete one or more building blocks of DNA (nucleotides) in the VPS13A gene. These changes in the gene lead to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of chorein. Many of the mutations are specific to single families, although people with chorea-acanthocytosis who are French-Canadian or Japanese tend to have a mutation that is specific to their population. It is unclear why mutations in the VPS13A gene affect only the brain and red blood cells, causing the signs and symptoms of chorea-acanthocytosis. "
1445,VPS13B ,vacuolar protein sorting 13 homolog B,"Researchers are still working to determine the exact role of the VPS13B gene (also called the COH1 gene) in the human body. Studies show that the protein produced from this gene is a part of the Golgi apparatus, which is a cell structure in which newly produced proteins are modified so they can carry out their functions. In particular, the VPS13B protein is involved in a modification called glycosylation, which is the attachment of sugar molecules to proteins. The VPS13B protein also appears to be involved in the sorting and transporting of proteins inside the cell.Studies suggest several functions for the VPS13B protein in the body. The protein appears to play an important role in the normal growth and development of nerve cells (neurons). It may also be involved in the growth and development of adipocytes, which are cells that store fats for energy, and may play a role in the storage and distribution of fats in the body.","Cohen syndrome More than 150 different mutations in the VPS13B gene have been found in individuals with Cohen syndrome. Individuals with this condition typically have intellectual disability, eye problems, and distinctive facial features. Another common feature of the condition is obesity, particularly around the torso but not the arms and legs (truncal obesity). Most of the mutations that cause Cohen syndrome result in a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the VPS13B protein. Researchers believe that this genetic change leads to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the protein. Studies suggest that a loss of this protein's function disrupts the organization of the Golgi apparatus and impairs normal glycosylation. However, it is not known how the absence of functional VPS13B protein or these cellular changes lead to the signs and symptoms of Cohen syndrome. Researchers speculate that problems with neuron development underlie intellectual disability, eye problems and other features of Cohen syndrome. Abnormal fat storage may cause truncal obesity in people with the condition.In the Finnish population, 75 percent of individuals with Cohen syndrome have a mutation in both copies of the VPS13B gene that deletes two DNA building blocks (base pairs). This mutation is sometimes written as 3348_3349delCT. The deletion causes a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the VPS13B protein.Two common mutations occur in the Old Order Amish population. The first mutation adds one base pair and is sometimes written as 9258_9259insT. This mutation creates a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the VPS13B protein. The second mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the VPS13B protein. Specifically, this mutation replaces the amino acid isoleucine with the amino acid threonine at position 2820 (written as Ile2820Thr or I2820T). Outside the Finnish and Amish populations, nearly all mutations in the VPS13B gene occur in only one or a small number of families. "
1446,VRK1 ,VRK serine/threonine kinase 1,"The VRK1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called VRK serine/threonine kinase 1. This protein is active in cells throughout the body.VRK serine/threonine kinase 1 plays a critical role in directing cell growth and division. This protein regulates several transcription factors, which are proteins that control the activity of genes by attaching (binding) to specific regions of DNA. VRK serine/threonine kinase 1 has a particularly important role in regulating a transcription factor called p53 (which is produced from the TP53 gene). The p53 protein repairs damaged DNA, regulates cell division, and prevents the formation of cancerous tumors. VRK serine/threonine kinase 1 stabilizes and activates the p53 protein and controls the levels of p53 in the nucleus.Studies suggest that VRK serine/threonine kinase 1 has several additional functions. This protein is involved in the assembly of the nuclear envelope, which is a structure that surrounds the nucleus and acts as a barrier between the nucleus and the rest of the cell. The nuclear envelope protects the DNA contained in the nucleus and regulates the movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus. VRK serine/threonine kinase 1 is also thought to play a role in the organization of chromatin. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and protein that packages DNA into chromosomes. Both the assembly of the nuclear envelope and the proper organization of chromatin are necessary for normal cell division.Researchers speculate that VRK serine/threonine kinase 1 may be involved in the development and maintenance of the nervous system, but its role is not well understood.","Pontocerebellar hypoplasia At least two mutations in the VRK1 gene have been identified in people with a disorder of brain development called pontocerebellar hypoplasia. The major features of this condition include delayed development, problems with movement, and intellectual disability. VRK1 gene mutations cause a small percentage of all cases of a form of the disorder designated pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1 (PCH1). When PCH1 results from VRK1 gene mutations, it is sometimes categorized more specifically as PCH1A.The VRK1 gene mutations that cause PCH1A significantly reduce the amount of VRK serine/threonine kinase 1 produced in cells. A shortage of this protein prevents it from carrying out its usual functions, including regulating the activity of transcription factors. Although these changes likely affect cell growth and division, it is unknown how they lead to abnormal brain development in people with PCH1A. "
1447,VWF ,von Willebrand factor,"The VWF gene provides instructions for making a blood clotting protein called von Willebrand factor. This protein contains regions that attach (bind) to specific cells and proteins during the formation of a blood clot. After an injury, clots protect the body by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss.Von Willebrand factor is made within endothelial cells, which line the inside surface of blood vessels, and bone marrow cells. The factor is made of several identical subunits. To facilitate binding to various cells and proteins, these subunits are cut into smaller pieces by an enzyme called ADAMTS13. Von Willebrand factor helps platelets stick together and adhere to the walls of blood vessels at the site of a wound. These groups of platelets form temporary clots, plugging holes in blood vessel walls to help stop bleeding. Von Willebrand factor also carries another blood clotting protein, coagulation factor VIII, to the area of clot formation.","Von Willebrand disease More than 300 mutations in the VWF gene have been found to cause von Willebrand disease. Mutations in the VWF gene that reduce the amount of von Willebrand factor cause type 1 von Willebrand disease. People with type 1 von Willebrand disease have von Willebrand factor in their bloodstream, but at reduced amounts. Mutations that disrupt the function of the von Willebrand factor cause the four subtypes of type 2 von Willebrand disease. These mutations usually change one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make von Willebrand factor, which can disrupt the factor's ability to bind to various cells and proteins needed to form a blood clot. Mutations that result in an abnormally short, nonfunctional von Willebrand factor generally cause the more severe type 3 von Willebrand disease. A reduction in the amount of von Willebrand factor or problems with its function slows the formation of blood clots, which causes the prolonged bleeding episodes seen in von Willebrand disease. "
1448,WAS ,Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome,"The WAS gene provides instructions for making a protein called WASP. This protein is found in all blood cells. WASP is involved in relaying signals from the surface of blood cells to the actin cytoskeleton, which is a network of fibers that make up the cell's structural framework. WASP signaling triggers the cell to move and attach to other cells and tissues (adhesion). In white blood cells, which protect the body from infection, this signaling allows the actin cytoskeleton to establish the interaction between cells and the foreign invaders that they target (immune synapse).","Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome More than 350 mutations in the WAS gene have been found to cause Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, a condition characterized by abnormal immune system function (immune deficiency) and a reduced ability to form blood clots leading to prolonged bleeding episodes. Most of the mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of WASP or prevent the production of any WASP. As a result, WASP cannot relay signals, which disrupts the function of the actin cytoskeleton in developing blood cells. White blood cells that lack WASP have a decreased ability to respond to their environment and form immune synapses. As a result, white blood cells are less able to respond to foreign invaders, causing many of the immune problems related to Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Similarly, when cells that aid blood clot formation (platelets) lack functional WASP, their development is impaired. A reduction in platelet size and early cell death leads to the bleeding problems in affected individuals. The impairments of white blood cells and platelets are largely responsible for the immune deficiency and bleeding problems characteristic of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. "
1449,WASHC5 ,WASH complex subunit 5,"The WASHC5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called strumpellin. Strumpellin is active (expressed) throughout the body, although its exact function is unknown. The protein's structure suggests that stumpellin may interact with the structural framework inside cells (the cytoskeleton) and may attach (bind) to other proteins.","Spastic paraplegia type 8 At least three mutations in the WASHC5 gene have been found to cause spastic paraplegia type 8. These mutations change single building blocks (amino acids) in the strumpellin protein. One mutation that has been seen in multiple families replaces the amino acid valine with the amino acid phenylalanine at position 626 in strumpellin (written Val626Phe or V626F). WASHC5 gene mutations are thought to change the structure of the strumpellin protein. It is unknown how the altered strumpellin protein causes muscle weakness, muscle stiffness, and other features of spastic paraplegia type 8. "
1450,WDR19 ,WD repeat domain 19,"The WDR19 gene (also known as IFT144) provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the formation and maintenance of cilia, which are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. Cilia participate in signaling pathways that transmit information within and between cells and are important for the development and function of many types of cells and tissues, including cells in the kidneys and liver and the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina). Cilia also play a role in the development of the bones, although the mechanism is not well understood.The movement of substances within cilia and similar structures called flagella is known as intraflagellar transport. This process is essential for the assembly and maintenance of these cell structures. During intraflagellar transport, cells use molecules called IFT particles to carry materials to and from the tips of cilia. Each IFT particle is made up of two groups of IFT proteins: complex A and complex B. The protein produced from the WDR19 gene forms part of IFT complex A (IFT-A). During intraflagellar transport, this complex carries materials from the tip to the base of cilia.The IFT-A complex is essential for proper regulation of the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is important for the growth and maturation (differentiation) of cells and the normal shaping (patterning) of many parts of the body, especially during embryonic development. The exact role of the complex in this pathway is unclear.","Cranioectodermal dysplasia At least two mutations in the WDR19 gene have been found in individuals with cranioectodermal dysplasia. This condition is characterized by an elongated head (dolichocephaly) with a prominent forehead and other distinctive facial features; short bones; and abnormalities of certain tissues known as ectodermal tissues, which include the teeth, hair, nails, and skin. Cranioectodermal dysplasia can also cause a variety of other problems, including a kidney condition called nephronophthisis and eye abnormalities.The WDR19 gene mutations involved in cranioectodermal dysplasia reduce the amount of functional WDR19 protein. A shortage or reduction in activity of this component of the IFT-A complex impairs the function of the entire complex, disrupting transport of proteins and materials from the tips of cilia. As a result, assembly and maintenance of cilia is impaired, which leads to a smaller number of cilia and abnormalities in their shape and structure. Although the mechanism is unclear, a loss of normal cilia impedes proper development of bone and other tissues, leading to the features of cranioectodermal dysplasia. Some researchers suggest that disrupted intraflagellar transport prevents signaling through the Sonic Hedgehog pathway, which could impact cell growth and other functions in several tissues throughout the body. "
1451,WDR35 ,WD repeat domain 35,"The WDR35 gene (also known as IFT121) provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the formation and maintenance of cilia, which are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. Cilia participate in signaling pathways that transmit information within and between cells and are important for the development and function of many types of cells and tissues, including cells in the kidneys and liver and the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina).

The exact role of the complex in this pathway is unclear.","Cranioectodermal dysplasia The WDR35 gene is the most commonly mutated gene in people with cranioectodermal dysplasia; at least eight mutations in this gene have been identified in affected individuals. This condition is characterized by an elongated head (dolichocephaly) with a prominent forehead and other distinctive facial features; short bones; and abnormalities of certain tissues known as ectodermal tissues, which include the teeth, hair, nails, and skin.The WDR35 gene mutations involved in cranioectodermal dysplasia reduce the amount of functional WDR35 protein.

Some researchers suggest that disrupted intraflagellar transport prevents signaling through the Sonic Hedgehog pathway, which could impact cell growth and other functions in several tissues throughout the body. "
1452,WDR45 ,WD repeat domain 45,"The WDR45 gene provides instructions for making a protein called WD40 repeat protein interacting with phosphoinositides 4 (WIPI4). WIPI4 is a member of a group of proteins each with a characteristic structure resembling a seven-bladed propeller. The WIPI4 protein is involved in the early stages of a process called autophagy, which helps clear unneeded materials from cells, including excess amounts of an iron storage protein called ferritin. In autophagy, worn-out cell parts (such as organelles, which are specialized structures that perform certain tasks within the cell) and other materials that are no longer needed are isolated in tiny compartments called autophagosomes. The WIPI4 protein helps control (regulate) the production and elongation of autophagosomes to contain the materials. The autophagosomes are then transported to organelles called lysosomes, which act as recycling centers within cells. Lysosomes use digestive enzymes to break down waste substances and recycle worn-out cell components.","Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration More than 50 WDR45 gene mutations have been identified in people with beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN), a disorder that damages the nervous system. This damage leads to delayed development and recurrent seizures (epilepsy) beginning in infancy or early childhood, movement problems that get worse over time, and a gradual loss of intellectual functioning in adulthood. Affected individuals eventually have a buildup of iron in the brain that can be seen with medical imaging; for this reason, BPAN is classified as a type of disorder called neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA).Most of the WDR45 gene mutations identified in people with BPAN are thought to result in the production of an unstable WIPI4 protein that is quickly broken down, leading to loss of WIPI4 protein function. Without functional WIPI4 protein, the process of autophagy is impaired, making cells less efficient at removing damaged organelles and waste materials. Researchers suggest that nerve cells (neurons) may be particularly vulnerable to impaired autophagy because they have long extensions (axons and dendrites), making it even more difficult to transport the waste materials from these structures to the lysosomes in the cell body for recycling. The waste materials can build up in these areas and damage them. Damage to neurons results in the neurological problems that occur in BPAN. "
1453,WFS1 ,wolframin ER transmembrane glycoprotein,"The WFS1 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called wolframin that is thought to regulate the amount of calcium in cells. A proper calcium balance is important for many different cellular functions, including cell-to-cell communication, the tensing (contraction) of muscles, and protein processing. The wolframin protein is found in many different tissues, such as the pancreas, brain, heart, bones, muscles, lungs, liver, and kidneys.Within cells, wolframin is located in the membrane of a structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. Among its many activities, the endoplasmic reticulum folds and modifies newly formed proteins so they have the correct 3-dimensional shape to function properly. The endoplasmic reticulum also helps transport proteins and other molecules to specific sites within the cell or to the cell surface. Wolframin is thought to play a role in protein folding and aid in the maintenance of endoplasmic reticulum function by regulating calcium levels. In the pancreas, wolframin may help fold a protein precursor of insulin (called proinsulin) into the mature hormone that controls blood glucose levels. In the inner ear, wolframin may help maintain the proper levels of calcium ions or other charged particles that are essential for hearing.","Nonsyndromic hearing loss More than 30 WFS1 gene mutations have been identified in individuals with a form of nonsyndromic hearing loss called DFNA6. People with this condition have hearing loss without related signs and symptoms affecting other parts of the body. Individuals with DFNA6 nonsyndromic deafness cannot hear low tones (low-frequency sounds), such as sounds from a tuba or the &quot;m&quot; in moon. Most WFS1 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make wolframin. WFS1 gene mutations probably result in a wolframin protein with an altered 3-dimensional shape, which could affect its function. It is thought that the loss of cells in the inner ear, along with the disruption of the normal function of cells in the part of the brain responsible for hearing, lead to hearing loss in affected individuals. Researchers also suggest that altered wolframin disturbs the balance of calcium in the inner ear, which interferes with the hearing process. "
1454,WNK1 ,WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 1,"The WNK1 gene provides instructions for making multiple versions (isoforms) of the WNK1 protein. The different WNK1 isoforms are important in several functions in the body, including blood pressure regulation and pain sensation.One isoform produced from the WNK1 gene is the full-length version, called the L-WNK1 protein, which is found in cells throughout the body. A different isoform, called the kidney-specific WNK1 protein or KS-WNK1, is found only in kidney cells. The L-WNK1 and KS-WNK1 proteins act as kinases, which are enzymes that change the activity of other proteins by adding a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) at specific positions.The L-WNK1 and KS-WNK1 proteins regulate channels in the cell membrane that control the transport of sodium or potassium into and out of cells. In the kidneys, sodium channels help transport sodium into specialized cells, which then transfer it into the blood. This transfer helps keep sodium in the body through a process called reabsorption. Potassium channels handle excess potassium that has been transferred from the blood into kidney cells. The channels transport potassium out of the cells in a process called secretion, so that it can be removed from the body in urine.The L-WNK1 protein increases sodium reabsorption and decreases potassium secretion, whereas the KS-WNK1 protein has the opposite effect. Sodium and potassium are important for regulating blood pressure, and a balance of L-WNK1 protein and KS-WNK1 protein in the kidneys helps maintain the correct levels of sodium and potassium for healthy blood pressure.Another isoform produced from the WNK1 gene, called the WNK1/HSN2 protein, is found in the cells of the nervous system, including nerve cells that transmit the sensations of pain, temperature, and touch (sensory neurons). The WNK1/HSN2 protein appears to regulate channels in the cell membrane that can transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions). These channels maintain the proper amount of chloride inside cells, which is important for controlling the activation (excitation) of the neurons.","Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type II Mutations in the WNK1 gene are responsible for one type of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type II (HSAN2) called HSAN2A. People with HSAN2A lose the ability to feel pain or sense hot and cold. More than a dozen mutations in the WNK1 gene have been identified in people with HSAN2A. All of these mutations lead to an abnormally shortened WNK1/HSN2 protein that is probably nonfunctional. People with HSAN2A have a reduction in the number of sensory neurons; however, the role that the abnormal WNK1/HSN2 protein plays in that loss is unclear. The loss of sensory neurons results in the signs and symptoms of HSAN2A.WNK1 gene mutations involved in HSAN2A do not appear to affect the L-WNK1 or KS-WNK1 isoforms. "
1455,WNK4 ,WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 4,"The WNK4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a role in blood pressure regulation by helping control the amount of sodium and potassium in the body. The WNK4 protein acts as a kinase, which is an enzyme that changes the activity of other proteins by adding a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) at specific positions.The WNK4 protein regulates channels in the cell membrane that control the transport of sodium or potassium into and out of cells, which occurs primarily in the kidneys. Sodium channels help transport sodium into specialized kidney cells, which then transfer it into the blood. This transfer helps keep sodium in the body through a process called reabsorption. Potassium channels handle excess potassium that has been transferred from the blood into the kidney cells. The channels transport the potassium out of the cells in a process called secretion, so that it can be removed from the body in the urine. The WNK4 protein is able to promote sodium reabsorption and block potassium secretion. Depending on conditions in the cell, the WNK4 protein is also able to block (inhibit) sodium reabsorption.","Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 At least eight mutations in the WNK4 gene have been found to cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 (PHA2), a condition characterized by high blood pressure (hypertension) and high levels of potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia). The mutations involved in this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the WNK4 protein. The alterations to the WNK4 protein impair its breakdown, resulting in higher than normal levels of WNK4 protein and elevated WNK4 activity. The increase in WNK4 activity leads to increased sodium reabsorption and reduced potassium secretion, resulting in hypertension and hyperkalemia. "
1456,WNT3 ,Wnt family member 3,"The WNT3 gene is part of a large family of WNT genes, which play critical roles in development before birth. WNT genes provide instructions for making proteins that participate in chemical signaling pathways in the body. These pathways control the activity of certain genes and regulate the interactions between cells during embryonic development.Research in animals indicates that the protein produced from the WNT3 gene is critical for the outgrowth of the limbs in the developing embryo. The WNT3 protein also appears to play an important role in determining the anterior-posterior axis (the imaginary line that runs from head to tail in animals) during the earliest stages of embryonic development. Additionally, the effects of mutations in the human WNT3 gene suggest that the protein may be involved in the normal formation of the facial features, head, heart, lungs, nervous system, skeleton, and genitalia.","Tetra-amelia syndrome A mutation in the WNT3 gene has been shown to cause tetra-amelia syndrome among members of one large family from Turkey. This mutation, which occurs in both copies of the WNT3 gene in each cell, replaces one protein building block (amino acid) with a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the WNT3 protein. This mutation is written as Gln83Ter or Q83X.Researchers believe that the Gln83Ter mutation results in the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the WNT3 protein. Loss of the WNT3 protein disrupts normal limb formation before birth and leads to the other serious birth defects associated with tetra-amelia syndrome. "
1457,WNT4 ,Wnt family member 4,"The WNT4 gene belongs to a family of WNT genes that play critical roles in development before birth. WNT genes provide instructions for making proteins that participate in chemical signaling pathways in the body. These pathways control the activity of certain genes and regulate the interactions between cells during embryonic development.The WNT4 gene provides instructions for producing a protein that is important for the formation of the female reproductive system, the kidneys, and several hormone-producing glands. During the development of the female reproductive system, the WNT4 protein regulates the formation of the Müllerian ducts, which are structures in the embryo that develop into the uterus, fallopian tubes, cervix, and the upper part of the vagina. This protein is also involved in development of the ovaries, from before birth through adulthood, and is important for development and maintenance of egg cells (oocytes) in the ovaries. In addition, the WNT4 protein regulates the production of male sex hormones (androgens).","Müllerian aplasia and hyperandrogenism At least three mutations in the WNT4 gene have been found to cause Müllerian aplasia and hyperandrogenism, a condition that affects the reproductive system in females. Girls and women with this condition typically have an underdeveloped or absent uterus and do not menstruate. They may also have abnormally high levels of androgens, which can cause acne and excessive facial hair.WNT4 gene mutations involved in Müllerian aplasia and hyperandrogenism change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the WNT4 protein. Researchers suspect that the altered protein cannot be released from cells as it normally would be; the trapped protein is unable to perform its usual functions. Loss of regulation by WNT4 likely disrupts development of the female reproductive system and induces abnormal production of androgens, leading to the features of Müllerian aplasia and hyperandrogenism. "
1458,WNT5A ,Wnt family member 5A,"The WNT5A gene is part of a large family of WNT genes, which play critical roles in development starting before birth. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that participate in chemical signaling pathways in the body. Wnt signaling controls the activity of certain genes and regulates the interactions between cells during embryonic development.The protein produced from the WNT5A gene is part of chemical signaling pathways that control the movement of cells (cell migration) and attachment of cells to one another (cell adhesion) during early development. Studies suggest that the WNT5A protein plays important roles in the normal development of many parts of the body, including the brain, skeleton, blood cells, and fatty (adipose) tissue.","Robinow syndrome At least six mutations in the WNT5A gene have been found to cause the autosomal dominant form of Robinow syndrome, a condition that affects the development of many parts of the body, particularly the bones. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most of the known mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the WNT5A protein. These mutations alter the structure of the protein, which likely affects its interactions with other proteins involved in Wnt signaling. The resulting impairment of Wnt signaling pathways disrupts the development of many organs and tissues, leading to the features of Robinow syndrome. "
1459,WNT10A ,Wnt family member 10A,"The WNT10A gene is part of a large family of WNT genes, which play critical roles in development starting before birth. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that participate in chemical signaling pathways in the body. Wnt signaling controls the activity of certain genes and regulates the interactions between cells during embryonic development.The protein produced from the WNT10A gene plays a role in the development of many parts of the body. It appears to be essential for the formation of tissues that arise from an embryonic cell layer called the ectoderm. These tissues include the skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands. Researchers believe that the WNT10A protein is particularly important for the formation and shaping of both baby (primary) teeth and adult (permanent) teeth.","Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia Several mutations in the WNT10A gene have been found to cause hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, the most common form of ectodermal dysplasia. Starting before birth, ectodermal dysplasias result in the abnormal development of the skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands. Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is characterized by a reduced ability to sweat (hypohidrosis), sparse scalp and body hair (hypotrichosis), and several missing teeth (hypodontia) or teeth that are malformed. WNT10A gene mutations account for about 5 percent of all cases of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia.Most of the WNT10A gene mutations associated with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the WNT10A protein, which impairs its function. The resulting shortage of functional WNT10A protein disrupts Wnt signaling during the development of ectodermal tissues, particularly the teeth.Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia can result from mutations in several genes. When the condition is caused by WNT10A gene mutations, its features are more variable than when the condition is caused by mutations in any other gene. Signs and symptoms range from mild to severe, and mutations in this gene are more likely to cause all of the permanent teeth to be missing. "
1460,WRN ,Werner syndrome RecQ like helicase,"The WRN gene provides instructions for producing the Werner protein, which plays a critical role in repairing damaged DNA. The Werner protein functions as a type of enzyme called a helicase. Helicase enzymes generally unwind and separate double-stranded DNA. The Werner protein also functions as an enzyme called an exonuclease. Exonucleases trim the broken ends of damaged DNA by removing DNA building blocks (nucleotides). Research suggests that the Werner protein first unwinds the DNA and then removes abnormal DNA structures that have been accidentally generated.Overall, the Werner protein helps maintain the structure and integrity of a person's DNA. This protein plays an important role in copying (replicating) DNA before cell division and transferring the information in genes to the cell machinery that makes proteins (transcription). Additionally, recent studies suggest that the Werner protein may be particularly important for maintaining DNA at the ends of chromosomes (telomeres).","Werner syndrome More than 60 mutations in the WRN gene are known to cause Werner syndrome. Most of these mutations result in an abnormally short, nonfunctional Werner protein. Research suggests that this shortened protein is not transported into the cell's nucleus, where it normally interacts with DNA. Furthermore, the shortened protein is broken down more quickly than the normal Werner protein, reducing the amount of this protein in the cell. Without normal Werner protein in the nucleus, DNA replication, repair, and transcription are disrupted. Researchers are still determining how mutations in the WRN gene lead to the signs and symptoms of Werner syndrome. "
1461,WT1 ,Wilms tumor 1,"The WT1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is necessary for the development of the kidneys and gonads (ovaries in females and testes in males) before birth. After birth, WT1 protein activity is limited to a structure known as the glomerulus, which filters blood through the kidneys. The WT1 protein plays a role in cell growth, the process by which cells mature to perform specific functions (differentiation), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). To carry out these functions, the WT1 protein regulates the activity of other genes by attaching (binding) to specific regions of DNA. On the basis of this action, the WT1 protein is called a transcription factor.","Denys-Drash syndrome At least 80 mutations in the WT1 gene have been found to cause Denys-Drash syndrome, a condition that affects development of the kidneys and genitalia and most often affects males. These mutations are germline, which means they are present in cells throughout the body. The mutations that cause Denys-Drash syndrome almost always occur in areas of the gene known as exon 8 and exon 9. Most of these mutations result in changes in single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the WT1 protein. The most common mutation that causes Denys-Drash syndrome (found in about 40 percent of cases) replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid tryptophan at protein position 394 (written Arg394Trp or R394W).The mutations that cause Denys-Drash syndrome lead to the production of an abnormal WT1 protein that cannot bind to DNA. As a result, the activity of certain genes is unregulated, which impairs development of the kidneys and genitalia. Abnormal development of these organs leads to the signs and symptoms of Denys-Drash syndrome.Rarely, a mutation in exon 8 or exon 9 of the WT1 gene causes a related condition called Frasier syndrome (described below). Because these two conditions share a genetic cause and have overlapping features, some researchers have suggested that they are part of a spectrum and not two distinct conditions. "
1462,XDH ,xanthine dehydrogenase,"The XDH gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called xanthine dehydrogenase. This enzyme is involved in the normal breakdown of purines, which are building blocks of DNA and its chemical cousin, RNA. Specifically, it carries out the final two steps in the process: the conversion of a molecule called hypoxanthine to another molecule called xanthine, and the conversion of xanthine to uric acid, a waste product that is normally excreted in urine and feces.Xanthine dehydrogenase has been studied extensively because it can be involved in the production of molecules called superoxide radicals. Specifically, xanthine dehydrogenase is sometimes converted to another form called xanthine oxidase, which produces superoxide radicals. These molecules are byproducts of normal cell processes, and they must be broken down regularly to avoid damaging cells. Superoxide radicals are thought to play a role in many diseases, including heart disease and high blood pressure (hypertension).Researchers suspect that xanthine dehydrogenase plays a role in milk production (lactation) in women. However, the enzyme's role in lactation is unclear.","Hereditary xanthinuria At least 12 mutations in the XDH gene have been found to cause hereditary xanthinuria type I, a condition that most often affects the kidneys. These mutations reduce or eliminate the activity of xanthine dehydrogenase. As a result, the enzyme is not available to carry out the last two steps of purine breakdown. Because xanthine is not converted to uric acid, affected individuals have high levels of xanthine and very low levels of uric acid in their blood and urine. The excess xanthine can accumulate in the kidneys and other tissues. In the kidneys, xanthine forms tiny crystals that occasionally build up to create kidney stones. These stones can impair kidney function and ultimately cause kidney failure. Less commonly, xanthine crystals build up in the muscles, causing pain and cramping. In some people with hereditary xanthinuria, the condition does not cause any health problems. "
1463,XIAP ,X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis,"The XIAP gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in many types of cells, including immune cells. It helps protect these cells from self-destructing (undergoing apoptosis) by blocking (inhibiting) the action of certain enzymes called caspases, which are necessary for apoptosis. Specifically, the XIAP protein inhibits caspase enzymes 3, 7, and 9. The XIAP protein also plays a role in several other signaling pathways that are involved in various functions in the body.","X-linked lymphoproliferative disease XIAP gene mutations have been identified in some people with X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP). These mutations reduce or eliminate production of the XIAP protein. It is unknown how a lack of XIAP protein results in the signs and symptoms of XLP, including a proliferation of lymphocytes that destroys blood-forming cells and damages the liver and other organs (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis). "
1464,XK ,X-linked Kx blood group,"The XK gene provides instructions for producing a protein that is found in various tissues of the body, particularly the brain, muscle, and heart. This protein is also present on the surface of red blood cells and carries a molecule known as the Kx blood group antigen. Blood group antigens are found on the surface of red blood cells and determine a number of blood types. When blood cells with unfamiliar antigens enter the bloodstream, the body's immune system recognizes the cells as foreign and may trigger an immune reaction that destroys the foreign blood cells.The function of the XK protein is unclear; researchers believe that it might play a role in transporting substances into and out of cells. On red blood cells, the XK protein attaches to another blood group protein, the Kell protein. The function of this blood group complex is unknown.","McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome Approximately 30 mutations in the XK gene have been found to cause McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome. Most of these mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional XK protein or cause no XK protein to be produced at all. Missing or abnormal XK protein also affects another blood group antigen, the Kell protein, causing it to be less prevalent on the surface of red blood cells. How mutations in the XK gene cause the misshapen red blood cells and movement problems characteristic of McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome is unknown. "
1465,XPA ,"XPA, DNA damage recognition and repair factor","The XPA gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in repairing damaged DNA. DNA can be damaged by ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun and by toxic chemicals, radiation, and unstable molecules called free radicals.DNA damage occurs frequently, but normal cells are usually able to fix it before it can cause problems. One of the major mechanisms that cells use to fix DNA is known as nucleotide excision repair (NER). As part of this repair mechanism, the XPA protein helps verify DNA damage and stabilize the DNA as it is repaired. The XPA protein attaches (binds) to areas of damaged DNA, where it interacts with many other proteins as part of a large complex. Proteins in this complex unwind the section of DNA where the damage has occurred, snip out (excise) the abnormal section, and replace the damaged area with the correct DNA.","Xeroderma pigmentosum At least 25 mutations in the XPA gene have been found to cause xeroderma pigmentosum. Mutations in this gene are responsible for a very severe form of the disorder that is more common in the Japanese population than in other populations. Most Japanese people with xeroderma pigmentosum have the same XPA gene mutation, which is written as IVS3AS, G>C. This mutation prevents cells from producing any functional XPA protein. Other XPA gene mutations, which have been reported in Japan and elsewhere, result in the production of a defective version of the XPA protein or greatly reduce the amount of this protein that is made in cells.A partial or total loss of the XPA protein prevents cells from repairing DNA damage normally. As a result, abnormalities accumulate in DNA, causing cells to malfunction and eventually to become cancerous or die. These problems with DNA repair cause people with xeroderma pigmentosum to be extremely sensitive to UV rays from sunlight. When UV rays damage genes that control cell growth and division, cells can grow too fast and in an uncontrolled way. As a result, people with xeroderma pigmentosum have a greatly increased risk of developing cancer. These cancers occur most frequently in areas of the body that are exposed to the sun, such as the skin and eyes.When xeroderma pigmentosum is caused by XPA gene mutations, it is often associated with progressive neurological abnormalities. These nervous system problems include hearing loss, poor coordination, difficulty walking, movement problems, loss of intellectual function, difficulty swallowing and talking, and seizures. The neurological abnormalities are thought to result from a buildup of DNA damage, although the brain is not exposed to UV rays. Researchers suspect that other factors damage DNA in nerve cells. It is unclear why some people with xeroderma pigmentosum develop neurological abnormalities and others do not. "
1466,XPC ,"XPC complex subunit, DNA damage recognition and repair factor","The XPC gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in repairing damaged DNA. DNA can be damaged by ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun and by toxic chemicals, radiation, and unstable molecules called free radicals.DNA damage occurs frequently, but normal cells are usually able to fix it before it can cause problems. One of the major mechanisms that cells use to fix DNA is known as nucleotide excision repair (NER). The XPC protein starts this repair process by detecting DNA damage. Then a group (complex) of other proteins unwind the section of DNA where the damage has occurred, snip out (excise) the abnormal section, and replace the damaged area with the correct DNA.Studies suggest that the XPC protein may have additional roles in DNA repair and in other cell activities. Less is known about these proposed functions of the XPC protein.","Xeroderma pigmentosum More than 40 mutations in the XPC gene have been found to cause xeroderma pigmentosum. Mutations in this gene are the most common cause of this disorder in the United States and Europe.Most XPC gene mutations prevent the production of any XPC protein. A loss of this protein keeps cells from repairing DNA damage normally. As a result, abnormalities accumulate in DNA, causing cells to malfunction and eventually to become cancerous or die. These problems with DNA repair cause people with xeroderma pigmentosum to be extremely sensitive to UV rays from sunlight. When UV rays damage genes that control cell growth and division, cells can grow too fast and in an uncontrolled way. As a result, people with xeroderma pigmentosum have a greatly increased risk of developing cancer. These cancers occur most frequently in areas of the body that are exposed to the sun, such as the skin and eyes.Unlike some of the other forms of xeroderma pigmentosum, when the disorder is caused by mutations in the XPC gene it is generally not associated with neurological abnormalities (such as delayed development and hearing loss). It is unclear why some people with xeroderma pigmentosum develop neurological abnormalities and others do not. "
1467,YWHAE ,tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein epsilon,"The YWHAE gene provides instructions for making the 14-3-3 epsilon (ε) protein, which is part of the large 14-3-3 protein family. Proteins in this family attach (bind) to other proteins involved in cell signaling. 14-3-3 proteins either turn on (activate) or turn off (inactivate) these other proteins. The 14-3-3ε protein helps to regulate a variety of processes including cell division and sensitivity to insulin, a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels.The 14-3-3ε protein is active in tissues throughout the body, although its function is sometimes unclear. In the brain, this protein is involved in directing the movement of nerve cells (neuronal migration) by binding to other proteins involved in this process. It is thought that the 14-3-3ε protein is critical for proper neuronal migration and normal brain development.","Miller-Dieker syndrome The characteristic signs and symptoms of Miller-Dieker syndrome are caused by a deletion of genetic material near the end of the short (p) arm of chromosome 17. The chromosomal region that is typically deleted contains multiple genes, including the YWHAE gene. As a result of the deletion, people with this condition have only one copy of the YWHAE gene in each cell instead of the usual two copies.A deletion of one copy of the YWHAE gene in each cell reduces the amount of 14-3-3ε protein by about half. A shortage of 14-3-3ε protein increases the severity of lissencephaly (a problem with brain development in which the surface of the brain is abnormally smooth) in people with Miller-Dieker syndrome. "
1468,YY1AP1 ,YY1 associated protein 1,"The YY1AP1 gene provides instructions for making part of a group of associated proteins known as the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex. In the cell nucleus, this complex attaches (binds) to chromatin, which is the network of DNA and proteins that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. Chromatin remodeling by the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex allows cells to control the activity (expression) of certain genes. This complex also helps regulate several other critical cell functions, including repair of damaged DNA, cell specialization (differentiation), and cell growth and division (proliferation). Activity of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex appears to be particularly important in smooth muscle cells, which line the walls of blood vessels.","Grange syndrome At least five mutations in the YY1AP1 gene have been identified in people with Grange syndrome. This rare condition causes narrowing (stenosis) and blockage (occlusion) of blood vessels that supply blood to many organs and tissues, including the kidneys, brain, and heart. Grange syndrome can also be associated with short fingers and toes (brachydactyly), fusion of some of the fingers or toes (syndactyly), fragile bones that are prone to breakage, learning disabilities, and heart defects.Mutations in the YY1AP1 gene are described as ""loss-of-function"" because they prevent the production of any functional YY1AP1 protein. A loss of this protein disrupts the function of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, which alters the activity of multiple genes in smooth muscle cells. Researchers suspect that these changes in gene expression lead to reduced cell proliferation and differentiation. However, it is unclear how these changes cause narrowing and blockage of arteries. It is also unknown how YY1AP1 gene mutations are related to other features of Grange syndrome, such as bone abnormalities and learning disabilities. "
1469,ZAP70 ,zeta chain of T cell receptor associated protein kinase 70,"The ZAP70 gene provides instructions for making a protein called zeta-chain-associated protein kinase. This protein is part of a signaling pathway that directs the development of and turns on (activates) immune system cells called T cells. T cells identify foreign substances and defend the body against infection.The ZAP70 gene is important for the development and function of several types of T cells. These include cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells), whose functions include destroying cells infected by viruses. The ZAP70 gene is also involved in the activation of helper T cells (CD4+ T cells). These cells direct and assist the functions of the immune system by influencing the activities of other immune system cells.",ZAP70-related severe combined immunodeficiency More than 12 mutations in the ZAP70 gene have been identified in people with ZAP70-related severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). These mutations either change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the protein sequence or disrupt how genetic information is pieced together to make the blueprint for producing the protein.Mutations in the ZAP70 gene prevent the production of zeta-chain-associated protein kinase or result in a protein that is unstable and cannot perform its function. A loss of functional zeta-chain-associated protein kinase leads to the absence of CD8+ T cells and an excess of inactive CD4+ T cells. The resulting shortage of active T cells causes people with ZAP70-related SCID to be more susceptible to infection. 
1470,ZEB2 ,zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2,"The ZEB2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the formation of many organs and tissues before birth. This protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. Researchers have found that the ZEB2 protein is involved in chemical signaling pathways that regulate early growth and development.The ZEB2 protein is active in many types of cells before birth. It appears to be particularly important for the development of the neural crest, which is a group of cells in the early embryo that give rise to many tissues and organs. Neural crest cells migrate to form portions of the nervous system, glands that produce hormones (endocrine glands), pigment cells, smooth muscle and other tissues in the heart, and many tissues in the face and skull.The ZEB2 protein is also active in cells that are not derived from the neural crest. For example, this protein is involved in the development of the digestive tract, skeletal muscles, kidneys, and other organs.","Mowat-Wilson syndrome More than 180 mutations in the ZEB2 gene have been identified in people with Mowat-Wilson syndrome. These mutations almost always inactivate one copy of the ZEB2 gene. In some cases, the entire gene is deleted. In other cases, mutations within the gene lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the ZEB2 protein.A shortage of the ZEB2 protein disrupts the formation of many organs and tissues before birth. The abnormal development of neural crest-derived structures, such as the nervous system and facial features, underlie many of the signs and symptoms of Mowat-Wilson syndrome. The role of the ZEB2 protein in the development of nerves that control the digestive tract may help explain why many people with this condition also have Hirschsprung disease, an intestinal disorder that causes severe constipation, intestinal blockage, and enlargement of the colon. "
1471,ZFP57 ,ZFP57 zinc finger protein,"The protein produced from the ZFP57 gene is a member of a family called zinc finger proteins, which are involved in many cellular functions. Zinc finger proteins each contain one or more short regions called zinc finger domains. These regions include a specific pattern of protein building blocks (amino acids) and one or more charged atoms of zinc (zinc ions).Zinc finger proteins attach (bind) primarily to DNA. In most cases, these proteins attach to regions near certain genes and turn the genes on and off as needed. Proteins that bind to DNA and regulate the activity of particular genes are known as transcription factors. Some zinc finger proteins can also bind to other molecules, including RNA (a chemical cousin of DNA) and proteins.The ZFP57 protein is involved in the regulation of other genes by the addition of methyl groups, consisting of one carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms (methylation). Methylation is important in many cellular functions. These include determining whether the instructions in a particular segment of DNA are carried out or suppressed (gene silencing), regulating reactions involving proteins and lipids, and controlling the processing of chemicals that relay signals in the nervous system (neurotransmitters).","6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus Mutations in the ZFP57 gene cause about 10 percent of cases of 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus, a type of diabetes that occurs in infants. This disorder results from the overactivity (overexpression) of certain genes in a region of the long (q) arm of chromosome 6 called 6q24.People inherit two copies of their genes, one from their mother and one from their father. Usually both copies of each gene are active, or ""turned on,"" in cells. In some cases, however, only one of the two copies is normally turned on. Which copy is active depends on the parent of origin: some genes are normally active only when they are inherited from a person's father; others are active only when inherited from a person's mother. This phenomenon is known as genomic imprinting.The 6q24 region includes paternally expressed imprinted genes, which means that normally only the copy of each gene that comes from the father is active. The copy of each gene that comes from the mother is inactivated (silenced) by methylation.ZFP57 gene mutations cause a generalized impairment of gene silencing called hypomethylation of imprinted loci (HIL), which affects many imprinted regions including the imprinted region of 6q24. The resulting overactivity of genes in the 6q24 region that are involved with the regulation of insulin secretion and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis) may reduce the number of insulin-secreting beta cells or impair their function in affected individuals. Insulin controls how much glucose (a type of sugar) is passed from the blood into cells for conversion to energy. A shortage of insulin results in the impaired blood sugar control associated with diabetes mellitus.Because HIL resulting from ZFP57 gene mutations can affect expression of many imprinted genes, this mechanism may account for the additional health problems that occur in some people with 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus, such as malformations of the brain, heart, or kidneys. "
1472,ZFYVE26 ,zinc finger FYVE-type containing 26,"The ZFYVE26 gene provides instructions for making a protein called spastizin, which is found in most tissues. Spastizin is important in a process called autophagy, in which worn-out cell parts and unneeded proteins are recycled within cells. Specifically, spastizin is involved in the formation and maturation of sacs called autophagosomes (or autophagic vacuoles). Autophagosomes surround materials that need to be recycled. The autophagosome then attaches (fuses) to a cell structure called a lysosome, which breaks down and recycles the materials.In addition to being involved in clearing cells of unneeded materials, spastizin also plays a role in ensuring the proper division of cells. During the final stages of cell division, spastizin participates in the process by which the dividing cells separate from one another (cytokinesis).","Spastic paraplegia type 15 More than 30 mutations in the ZFYVE26 gene have been found to cause spastic paraplegia type 15. This condition is characterized by progressive movement problems, intellectual disability, and vision problems. Many of the ZFYVE26 gene mutations that cause this condition result in a shortened spastizin protein that is quickly broken down. As a result, functional autophagosomes are not produced, autophagy cannot occur, and recycling of materials within cells is decreased. An inability to break down unneeded materials, and the subsequent accumulation of these materials in cells, leads to cell dysfunction and often cell death. The loss of cells in the brain and other parts of the body is responsible for many of the features of spastic paraplegia type 15.It is unclear whether a lack of spastizin protein interferes with normal cytokinesis and whether impaired cell division contributes to the signs and symptoms of spastic paraplegia type 15. "
1473,ZIC2 ,Zic family member 2,"The ZIC2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in the development of the front part of the brain (forebrain). This protein is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of certain genes. The ZIC2 protein regulates genes involved in both early and late stages of forebrain development.","Nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly More than 80 mutations in the ZIC2 gene have been found to cause nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly. This condition occurs when the brain fails to divide into two halves (hemispheres) during early development. ZIC2 gene mutations are the second most common cause of nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly. The facial features of individuals with ZIC2 gene mutations are different from those with nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly caused by mutations in other genes. These distinctive facial features include a narrowing of the head at the temples, outside corners of the eyes that point upward (upslanting palpebral fissures), large ears, a short nose with upturned nostrils, and a broad and deep space between the nose and mouth (philtrum). It is unclear how mutations in the ZIC2 gene lead to these facial features.ZIC2 gene mutations that cause nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly reduce or eliminate the activity of the ZIC2 protein. Without enough functional ZIC2 protein, the genes involved in normal forebrain development are not properly controlled. As a result, the brain does not separate into two hemispheres. The signs and symptoms of nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly are caused by abnormal development of the brain and face. "
1474,ZMPSTE24 ,zinc metallopeptidase STE24,"The ZMPSTE24 gene provides instructions for making a protein that acts as a protease, which is an enzyme that cuts (cleaves) other proteins. The ZMPSTE24 protein cuts an immature version of the lamin A protein (prelamin A) at a particular location; this cleavage is an essential step in the maturation of lamin A.Mature lamin A is a component of the nuclear envelope, which is the membrane that surrounds the nucleus in cells. The nuclear envelope regulates the movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus, and researchers believe it may play a role in regulating the activity of certain genes.","Mandibuloacral dysplasia At least four mutations in the ZMPSTE24 gene cause a form of mandibuloacral dysplasia called mandibuloacral dysplasia with type B lipodystrophy (MADB). This condition is characterized by a variety of signs and symptoms, which can include bone abnormalities, mottled or patchy skin coloring, and loss of fatty tissue under the skin affecting all parts of the body (type B lipodystrophy). ZMPSTE24 gene mutations that cause MADB lead to a reduction of functional ZMPSTE24 protein. As a result, prelamin A is not processed efficiently, and it builds up in cells. In addition, there is a shortage of mature lamin A. Some researchers speculate that these changes damage the nucleus, making cells more fragile. It is not known how the effects of ZMPSTE24 gene mutations relate to the specific signs and symptoms of MADB. "
1475,ZMYM2 ,zinc finger MYM-type containing 2,"The ZMYM2 gene (previously known as ZNF198) provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not clearly understood. It is a member of a family of zinc finger proteins, which contain one or more short regions called zinc finger domains. The zinc finger domains in the ZMYM2 protein are thought to allow it to regulate interactions between other proteins. ZMYM2 is found in the nucleus of the cell, where it likely associates with other proteins. Through these associations, the ZMYM2 protein may be involved in repairing DNA errors, controlling gene activity, or forming structures in the nucleus called PML nuclear bodies that block the growth and division of cells and promote their self-destruction (apoptosis).","8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome A genetic change involving the ZMYM2 gene causes most cases of 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome. This condition is characterized by an increased number of white blood cells (myeloproliferative disorder) and the development of lymphoma, a blood-related cancer that causes tumor formation in the lymph nodes. The myeloproliferative disorder usually develops into another form of blood cancer called acute myeloid leukemia. 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome most commonly results from a rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosome 13 and chromosome 8. This genetic change fuses part of the ZMYM2 gene on chromosome 13 with part of the FGFR1 gene on chromosome 8. The translocation is found only in cancer cells.The protein produced from the normal FGFR1 gene can turn on cellular signaling that helps the cell respond to its environment, for example by stimulating cell growth. The protein produced from the fused ZMYM2-FGFR1 gene leads to constant FGFR1 signaling. The uncontrolled signaling promotes continuous cell growth and division, leading to cancer. "
1476,ZNF341 ,zinc finger protein 341,"The ZNF341 gene provides instructions for making a transcription factor, which is a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. The ZNF341 protein is thought to regulate the activity of the STAT1 and STAT3 genes, controlling production of the STAT1 and STAT3 proteins, respectively. Both proteins are involved in the immune system. They control pathways in cells that help fight foreign invaders such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi. The STAT3 protein, in particular, transmits signals for the maturation of immune system cells, especially T cells and B cells. STAT3 is also involved in normal development and maintenance of bones and other tissues.Researchers suspect that the ZNF341 protein controls the activity of other genes, although they have not been identified.","Autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome At least five mutations in the ZNF341 gene have been found to cause a condition similar to autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES), which is a disorder of the immune system characterized by recurrent skin and lung infections and abnormally high levels of an immune system protein called immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the blood. AD-HIES is usually caused by STAT3 gene mutations and follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means one altered copy of the gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. In contrast, the condition caused by ZNF341 gene mutations follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means both copies of the gene must be altered for immune system problems to develop.The ZNF341 gene mutations that cause an AD-HIES-like condition result in production of an abnormally short ZNF341 protein or production of no protein. With little or no ZNF341 protein, production of the STAT1 and STAT3 proteins is impaired. A shortage of functional STAT3 blocks the maturation of T cells (specifically a subset known as Th17 cells) and other immune cells. The resulting immune system abnormalities make people with AD-HIES highly susceptible to infections, particularly bacterial and fungal infections of the lungs and skin. A shortage of STAT1 protein is not thought to contribute to immune system problems in affected individuals. "
